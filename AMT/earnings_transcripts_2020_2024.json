I would now like to turn the conference over to your Investor Relations host, Kate Ruppe. Please go ahead.\nKate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover our 2020 highlights and discuss our 2021 priorities. I'll be followed by Steve and Jeff's more in depth discussion of sales and financial matters. Our 2020 highlights include new and expansion sales of $37.6 million of annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. Operating revenues of $606.8 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth. FFO per share of $5.31, representing a year-over-year increase of $0.21 per share or 4.1%. Delivery of 192,000 net rentable square feet or 22 megawatts of total new capacity, including the opening of two new data centers and seven-nines of power and cooling uptime. These achievements enabled us to execute on our 2020 goals of developing more capacity and completing projects on time, translating new and vacant capacity into sales, attracting quality new logos that value our campus ecosystems, thoughtfully expanding our products to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and maintaining high levels of facility performance and customer service. Overall, I am pleased with the team's ability to successfully execute these priorities amidst the backdrop of the global pandemic. We delivered SV8 Phase 3, NY2 Phase 3 and the first phases of new data centers at CH2 and LA3. As a result, we finished 2020 with 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell compared to 23 megawatts at the end of 2019. Examples of translating new capacity into higher sales included leasing 75% of SV8 Phase 3 and 80% of LA3 Phase 1 and accelerating leasing in Northern Virginia, our best year in terms of annualized GAAP rent in that market since 2015. While sales cycles for enterprises were elongated probably due to the economic and other uncertainties related to the virus, we continue to attract high quality new logos, especially in the financial services industry at NY2. We also expanded our connectivity options during the year, including adding Google Partner Interconnect and Oracle Cloud infrastructure to the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange, increasing bandwidth for AWS hosted connections on the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange in our Chicago campus; adding multimarket peering to our enhanced NE2 exchange; and as recently announced, adding access to Google Cloud using dedicated interconnect in Northern Virginia. In addition to these 2020 accomplishments, as we announced earlier this week, we appointed a new director to our Board, Mr. Michael Milligan. Mike brings us valuable telecommunications experience as well as noteworthy Board experience, which will be a tremendous asset to CoreSite as we continue our pattern of expanding our talent pool through increasing diversity. I also want to thank Jim Atwood and David Thompson for their Board service over the last 10 years. They have both served since the company's IPO in September 2010, and their contributions were many. Jim and David will continue to serve until our annual meeting in May. But as part of our periodic Board rotation, will voluntarily not seek reelection this year. We are very grateful for the service they have provided to CoreSite, its shareholders and its employees and customers and wish them the best in their future endeavors. As we move forward to 2021, our goals are similar to our 2020 goals as we build on last year's successes. Our ability to meet those goals is enhanced by greater available capacity to sell and the strong enterprise funnel that has been building up due to elongated sales cycles we saw for the enterprise vertical in 2020. One notable difference is that while we will continue being proactive for future developments, we do not need and do not have any new ground up data centers planned to come online in 2021. In closing, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us, and we believe our priorities and our other operating objectives will continue to drive long-term value to our customers, employees and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter sales results and then talk further about some of our key 2020 successes and drivers. Turning to our quarterly sales results. We delivered new and expansion sales of $9.7 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Please note that as of this earnings report and going forward, we have modified our reporting of new and expansion leases signed by deployment size included on Page 14 of our supplemental information. This revision reports our signed leases per period based on leased kilowatts rather than net rentable square feet. The change more closely aligns with how we manage sales activity internally and it is intended to provide greater visibility. New and expansion sales for the quarter included $4.4 million of annualized GAAP rent from retail leases, $3.7 million of GAAP rent from small scale leases and $1.5 million of GAAP rent from large scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 54,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annual GAAP rate of $180 per square foot and included an impressive 45 new logos, all with opportunities for future growth, our highest count since the first quarter of 2018. Looking more closely at new logos, the 45 new logos represents $0.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 8.5% of our total annualized GAAP rents signed during the quarter and were strongest in the enterprise vertical. Enhancing the ecosystem while diversifying the customer base through attracting and winning new customers remains a key area of focus, and it's great to see 45 new brands become part of that story. Next, I'll share some highlights from our sales wins. As Paul mentioned, during 2020, we executed $37.6 million of new and expansion sales in annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. It also represents an 18% increase in retail and small scale leasing compared to 2019. Driving our new and expansion sales this year were several key factors, including more available contiguous capacity to meet a broader range of customer requirements, ongoing strength in attracting and winning high quality new logo sales, strategic expansions from existing customers and a robust sustainable sales pipeline that includes customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation by deploying high performance hybrid cloud architectures. Let me expand on these drivers. Our new logo annualized GAAP rent for the full year was $4.3 million, which demonstrates the progress made against our goal to attract high quality new customers that value our platform, which will help drive future growth. As to strategic expansions with existing customers, our existing customers accounted for approximately 89% of the full year 2020 annualized GAAP rent signed, including expansions into additional markets. In summary, we are pleased with our sales execution during the year. We exited 2020 with ample contiguous capacity to support future sales opportunities as illustrated by the new capacity graph at the top of Page 18 of our supplemental information. We're optimistic about the fundamental market drivers supporting our strategy. The increasing need for enterprises to leverage technology in a seamless, high performance, hybrid multi cloud environment bodes well for the unique position of our network dense, cloud enabled campuses located in top enterprise markets. These market drivers align well with our ongoing product and services development, which are targeted easing the transition of enterprise with becoming customers by making data integration and application interoperability seamless. Our focus going forward will be to continue improving our ability to help customers solve their IT challenges as they address the changing dynamic needs of their industries and their customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, discuss our balance sheet, including leverage and liquidity and conclude with our financial outlook and guidance for 2021. Looking at our financial results. For the full year, operating revenues grew to $606.8 million, a 6% year-over-year increase, including interconnection revenue of $84.1 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $324.5 million, an increase of 5.3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, consistent with the trailing 12 month average. FFO per share was $5.31, which represents 4.1% year-over-year growth. And we declared dividends of $4.89 per share, representing an increase of 2.7%. For the quarter, operating revenues were $154.9 million, which represents 6.1% growth year-over-year and consistent sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 12.7% year-over-year, 3.8% sequentially. Customer lease renewals, equaling $15.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents a cash rent mark-to-market of 1%, and we reported churn of 5.4%. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our revenue backlog as of December 31st consisted of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or $21.4 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. We expect approximately 60% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $82.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.7% year-over-year and 1.6% sequentially. Net income was $0.46 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.05 year-over-year and $0.04 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.34, an increase of $0.04 or 3.1% year-over-year and $0.01 or 0.8% sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.2 times at year end, slightly lower-than-anticipated and inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 5.1 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $301 million of liquidity, providing us the ability to fully fund our 2021 business plan. In addition, we finished the year with 91% fixed rate debt. We expect our fixed rate debt percentage to decrease to approximately 80% by the end of 2021, absent any new debt or derivative instruments. I will now address our 2021 guidance. We ended the year at 81.9% occupancy in our data center portfolio and 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell. In addition, we have the ability to bring on consistent amounts of capacity through incremental computer rooms and infrastructure development within our existing data centers as needed and as anticipated absorption dictates. We reported elevated churn during 2020, slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance, with Q4 results slightly elevated due to a couple of customer move outs, accelerating their timing from Q1 2021. The following 2021 guidance is based on our outlook on current economic conditions, internal assumptions about our customer base and our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets. It does not include the impact of any future financing, investment or disposition activities beyond what has already been disclosed. I will cover the highlights of our 2021 guidance, but I will refer you to our complete guidance on Page 22 of our fourth quarter supplemental information for further details. Operating revenue is estimated to be $642 million to $652 million, representing 6.6% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. Our 2021 churn is estimated to be 6.5% to 8.5%, inclusive of the 200 basis points related to that specific Bay Area customer during the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect cash rent growth on data center renewals to be 0% to 2% growth for the year. Interconnection revenue is estimated to be $87 million to $93 million, representing 7% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $336 million to $346 million, which implies a 52.7% adjusted EBITDA margin and 5.1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. FFO per diluted share and operating unit is estimated to be $5.42 to $5.52, reflecting 3% growth at the midpoint. Based on our expectations and estimates related to leasing, net absorption and timing of commencements, we anticipate the year-over-year growth rates to accelerate in the second half of 2021 for revenue adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share. Lastly, capital expenditures are consistent with our original guidance provided in October and estimated to be $185 million to $225 million. In closing, we are pleased with our execution in 2020 and we look forward to the opportunities ahead to further help our customers solve their it needs and challenges as they accelerate their digital transformation. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSamiBadri: First question for Paul, maybe for Steve, I want to talk about the elongated sales cycles. And we know we could see and draw the connection between elongated sales cycles and the effects of the pandemic. But are you starting to see changes or any kind of behavioral movements that are happening that can better explain what you think might happen in 2021 as far as how enterprises age, the outsourced data center industry from where we are today?\nPaulSzurek: I do think we're starting to see some movement and it's hard to generalize because it's idiosyncratic to so many customers and even some regions like, for example, I think in New York, in New Jersey, we would have had better performance if it were for the uncertainty about the proposed transaction tax and some other industries things were moving along and then suddenly some additional acquisitions were taking place. And so the opportunity had to be resized. But for a lot of the customers, it's just them working through what their economic future looks like. There are growth opportunities. For some, it's accelerated digital transformation. For others that's accelerated the process of outlining and planning for digital transformation, but not quite gotten to the point where they're ready to pull the trigger. I do think with 2021, started off a little bit -- it wasn't exactly like the calendar turned and everything turned rosy and there were some bumps nationally and economically in the first month or so. But there appears to be some strong economic optimism going forward. And I think that, that will have a positive impact on sales cycles. Steve, anything you'd add?\nSteveSmith: No, I think you covered it well, Paul. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we feel like we're well positioned for the overall market trends, and that is really, any enterprise out there has become more interested in how they leverage technology to run their business. And the hybrid multi cloud environment is becoming more and more commonplace for a lot of enterprises. It is complex as to how they navigate that and we're working to try to make that as simple for them as possible, but that's part of what drives that elongated cycle. So it's all the things that Paul mentioned as well as just the overall complexity of how they manage that migration. So overall, I think customers are getting used to whatever the new normal is and working through those complications, but we feel like we're well positioned to support that.\nSamiBadri: I want to just shift to Jeff. Jeff, you talked about the backlog and the backlog commencement. I think if I heard you right, 1Q and 2Q 2021 should see the current backlog to commence. Now just to kind of triangulate the commencement schedule with the full year guidance. Does the full year guidance also called for relatively strong productivity in the sales force to bring in deals and do inter-quarter execution and deployment, or the full year guidance says very little on incremental execution and sales with productivity as we go through the year?\nJeffFinnin: Sami, yes, just to confirm, you heard correctly in regards to the commencement of the backlog. So again, 60% Q1, about 40% in Q2. And in terms of sales execution, I think is what you were gearing your question around. We would clearly believe that kind of, as Paul alluded to, that we would have good execution throughout the year. The only thing that I would add is we'll see some benefits from an expense perspective. If you just see the percentages we're guiding to, I think we'll see some decreases in our overall sales as a percentage of revenue during the year. I don't know if that's directly addressing your question, Sami or was there something else we could add?\nSamiBadri: Just if you think about how much incremental leasing that you guys imagine you need to make that guidance. Are you guys expecting meaningful incremental leasing activity to take place to make that guidance number, or are you relatively well rounded out as existing [Indiscernible] backlog?\nJeffFinnin: No, it's going to require some meaningful sales execution just as every year requires it. And I think when you look at where we ended the year this past year at just below $40 million, I think realistically, we would expect and anticipate somewhere being north of that $40 million as we think about this year, just to give you some idea. Obviously, I don't want to get into too many specifics because we don't generally guide to that. But that gives you some sense for what we're thinking about as we head into 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.\nJonathanAtkin: I was interested in the interconnect business, and if you don't mind drilling down a little bit on the drivers or pressures you're seeing in that segment. You've got a lot of different products that you offer. There's bilateral cross connects as well and then you've got the cloud operators and the on ramps and the carriers and the enterprises and then partners as well on the SDN side. And I just wondered, is there anything that kind of jumps out in terms of what's going particularly well, or where the growth rate might be slowing a little bit in that area?\nJeffFinnin: Let me give you a little bit of color, Jon, and then I'll ask Steve just to add any incremental color he sees obviously on the front lines. But when you look at 2020 and from a volume perspective, overall volume increases was about 7.7% for 2020. And as you saw on the revenue, overall revenue increases year-over-year was 11%. So those percentages are fairly consistent with generally what drives that revenue increases, which is about two thirds coming from volume increases, about another third of it coming from customers migrating from lower priced to higher-priced products and some price increases as customers roll or just general price increases. So that relationship has stayed fairly consistent in 2020. We saw really good growth in the fiber cross connects last year as well as our Open Cloud Exchange. And I think some of that may have been spawned on by the pandemic that we walked through and lived through in 2020. Obviously, when you look at our guide for this year, we're guiding to growth of about 7%. And so I think it's unclear at this point whether we're going to see that continued level of volume increases for 2021, it's something we're going to watch closely. But at this point, we think it will moderate slightly just given where we've guided the street to at this point in time. Steve, anything else?\nSteveSmith: I guess, I'd just add as far as trending and where we're seeing customer adoption and so forth. I mean, we're fortunate in that we were one of the -- in fact, I think, the first public data center provider to offer an OCX type of offering and Open Cloud Exchange, where it's basically an Ethernet backbone that allows customers to virtually connect to many different services on that backbone. We've made significant enhancements to that over the last several years. That's positioned us well for really where we see the trend going in the future, which is really kind of that end to end serviceability over SDN like network. So I think you'll continue to see more adoption of that and more services come available on that same platform, and that's part of what we're driving towards our product development.\nJonathanAtkin: And then secondly, on M&A and just noticed that there's a lot of activity kind of at the asset level in this sector, including in markets where you don't really have a presence. And I wonder to what extent -- if you can maybe just remind us of the sorts of things that you look at when you think about maybe entering a new kind of core data center, Internet gateway type market that you're not in because there were recently some opportunities. And I just wondered, are you looking to partner with people as you enter those markets? Is that entirely on balance sheet? Is it just not of interest, relative to maybe deploying capital where you already are? Maybe just kind of refresh us on your thinking there.\nPaulSzurek: We look at a lot of things, as we've said in the past, and our guidance is strategic fit, which really means what type of revenue synergies can we generate an above standard growth, if we do make the investment and then return on invested capital. Does it benefit our shareholders in the intermediate and long term, and hopefully, the short-term as well or does it not? We're not averse to partnering if that makes sense and the opportunity is there. But generally, that can be more complicated than it sounds at first glance. Again, we've looked at a lot of things. And when those criteria are met, we'll do something. When they're not, we won't.\nJonathanAtkin: And then lastly, is there any kind of an update on the Stender campus in Santa Clara, SV9 seems like that's ready to break ground, and there's been obviously some increased occupancy at SV8. And maybe just kind of give us some color on the demand pipeline that you think the market is seeing and what's happening with kind of overall absorption. There's been, I think, a lot of activity in that market away from you. And I wondered to what extent you might think Santa Clara might drive some of your growth this year?\nPaulSzurek: So I'll let Steve address supply and demand in that market. Although I will tell you, I feel good about it. SV9, as we said last quarter, we are targeting having our permits and everything by the end of the first quarter. So far, the processes are trending that way. But in that market, and Jon, you probably know the dynamics of permitting and power there as well as anybody. You can't really say it's done until it's done. So we still have a couple more things we've got to finish up. And hopefully, we'll get those finished up and have it shovel ready by the end of this quarter.\nSteveSmith: And I would just add, as far as the overall supply demand dynamics are concerned, we continue to see strong demand in the market. And so we're bullish on where we're heading with those investments, where we sit with our overall capacity and pipeline in that space. So overall, we're confident with where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg.\nNateCrossett: More of a big picture question. How are you guys thinking about the edge, is it a risk to your business at all? And have you guys done any analysis in terms of whether workloads that are currently in your campuses could move closer to the edge over time?\nPaulSzurek: We have. I don't think anyone can say right now that with certainty, they know exactly what's going to evolve. But our expectation is that there's minimal exposure for us of workloads that are currently in our data centers going to the edge exclusively. And there's probably a good opportunity for our data centers as core peering places in the central markets to benefit it through the increased products and services that are offered at the further edge through 5G, IoT, things like that, just because of -- the beautiful thing about data is that it works when there's a lot of it pooled together, and you'll see a lot of that necessary for those applications. So that's our high-level view of it. We continue to monitor it closely and evaluate potential product help in those areas and partners to work with. But at a high level, we think it will be ultimately beneficial.\nSteveSmith: And I guess the last thing I would just add there is the edge can be defined by a lot of different people in a lot of different ways. And we feel like we're well positioned in a lot of edge markets. I mean, if you look at the key metro areas that we're in, where there's a lot of eyeballs, a lot of enterprises that are in very low latency proximity to our data center campuses. In many definitions, that is edge because we're right next to where those eyeballs and enterprises locate.\nNate Crossett: And then I just had one question on pricing. The renewal guidance is 0% to 2% and if you're looking forward, kind of the next four years, it looks like the lease expirations are at a higher rate than what you did in 2020. So I'm just kind of wondering, should we expect kind of pressure on pricing going forward? Can that 0% to 2% range, even go negative?\nJeffFinnin: Nate, I'll just offer a little bit there. Obviously, the pricing in full you're looking at is on a per square foot basis. And on the renewal pricing, when you look at what we did this year, the dollars per square foot were compressed largely due to the density inside those deployments. So the density really plays into the fact and when we're obviously competing and having those conversations with customers, pricing is going to be on a kilowatt basis. And so I wouldn't read too much into that on a per square foot basis. There's just a lot of variables, density being the largest in terms of what's going to ultimately resolve in that pricing. But obviously, as we head into 2021, you saw where we ended 2020 right about in the middle of our guidance for our mark to market at 0.8%, and we expect to be somewhere in between that 0% and 2% as we work our way through this year. And then obviously, we'll continue to watch it beyond that and give you additional color as needed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordanSadler: So I wanted to just follow-up on sort of the pipeline and Santa Clara. It felt previously like you guys were pretty constructive and optimistic about the ability to backfill the outbound tenant there. What are your sort of most current thoughts there?\nPaulSzurek: Jordan, current thoughts haven't changed. We're still optimistic about backfilling that space in SV7.\nJordanSadler: Is that kind of to do list for the front half of '21 or could that take longer?\nPaulSzurek: I mean, we typically don't give previews of when like something might be signed. But when it is signed, we'll announce it.\nJordanSadler: And then in terms of the churn, Jeff, you did talk about maybe pull forward from 1Q. Can you maybe talk about what the source, the types of tenants that you would drop the reacceleration of churn up to? And did they have anything to do with the decisions around what you're doing with the US colo space in LA1, LA4?\nJeffFinnin: As it relates to the churn in the fourth quarter, we had about 60 to 70 basis points incremental churn in the fourth quarter that really moved essentially from January of '21 when we anticipated up to December here in the fourth quarter of this last year. So not a real big economic impact. It really is just a shift in the timing. Again, that was about 60 to 70 basis points. And it was really with three customers, one of them happened to be in probably the largest percentage. It was just another reseller that was in our portfolio that we had anticipated to move out and did it roughly 30 days prior to when we anticipated. And so hopefully, that gives you some additional color. And then what was the second half of the question, Jordan?\nPaulSzurek: Whether LA4\u2026\nJeff Finnin: No, it's as it relates to LA4, I appreciate you picking up on that in some of the disclosures there. Obviously, that LA4 is a location that's in close proximity to LA1 and LA2 and LA3. And obviously, our objective is to drive business into our owned assets and there's just much better longer term, better assets to drive business to. And we're currently in process migrating over all those businesses that we can from LA4 into LA2. And so we've already done some of that. And our team in LA is working on getting the lion's share of that completed here this year. But that churn that I commented earlier had nothing to do with LA4. At this point, that's still in process and we'll work through that in 2021.\nJordanSadler: And then as you look through to the 2021 guide on churn, I noticed that came down 50 basis points or so at the midpoint, 100 at the low end, I assume due to this pull forward. Is there anything else to potentially be worried about, and what are you guys doing to sort of get your arms around this guide?\nJeffFinnin: Well, as you think about it, obviously, as we've pointed out, we've got about 200 of that coming from the single customer at SV7, that will occur in the second half of this year. And in terms of what are we doing to get our arms around it, I can tell you that between my team and Steve's team, it's something that we address on a weekly basis, trying to continue to look as far forward as we can, both through conversations and relationships we're having as well as looking at incremental data around each of those deployments to better understand ultimately what that information is telling us on customer behavior to help give us a point on which direction those are ultimately going to go. And from a customer service perspective, it's always been a very high part of our business, and I would say we're continuing to even elevate it to a higher level under the guide of our operations team, and it's something we're continuing to get out in front of. We want to make sure we retain those customers every time we can and when it makes sense. And hopefully, avoid any of the surprises like we had in the past. But based on where we sit today and what we know today, we think that 6.5% to 8.5% for 2021 is a good number and is in right in line with what we anticipated.\nPaulSzurek: Jordan, the only thing I'd add to what Jeff said is that the categories of customers that drove churn over the last couple of years are now a very, very small percentage of our portfolio, and those are business models that have been especially disrupted by cloud.\nJordanSadler: Yes, I mean the reason I ask, obviously, this has been a little bit of a sort of a thorn on your side. I think the churn number over the past couple of years, and you've got 29% of your annual rent expiring in '21, and 1,277 different leases a lot. And so I kind of -- I guess it doesn't seem outside of the one known move out, the larger move out, you have a ton of wiggle room in the 7.5%, because that's the nonmove out, you're basically looking at, I don't know, 1.25% churn on a normalized basis. So outside of the nonmove out, that seems like a low number relative to at least the last four quarters. And I don't know why it would be particularly low next year or this year?\nPaulSzurek: I mean, we've had numbers that low or even lower in prior years. And again, it relates to the cyclicality of some of these business models or actually, I should say, the secular changes that affect some of these business models. Again, that's our guidance. We wouldn't put it out there if we didn't feel that it was the right range to put out there.\nSteveSmith: And the other thing, I guess, I would just add is roughly 30% of our base renewing in the year is not a normal. It's very typical for us actually. And if you look at the average length of our leases of roughly three to four years, that's what you can expect, I think.\nJordanSadler: No, and I appreciate that. I didn't mean to insinuate that it was sort of outside of the ordinary. I just feel like it's a big number and maybe the churn number of 5.5 outside of the nonmove out was a little bit low relative to history. Is that unfair?\nPaulSzurek: Well, I mean, it depends on which history. And as I said, we certainly have numbers that low in previous years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.\nDaveRodgers: I think Jordan hit the renewal side of the equation. Maybe I wanted to go back to the idea of sales cycle elongated. But Jeff, in your comments, you also said you expect leasing to accelerate. So maybe I'd ask you, Steve, to talk more about what's in the funnel. Last year, you guys were pretty positive about the funnel as well. Can you talk about lease touring activity, any of those kind of early indicators that are going to give us that confidence that we'll see this acceleration in leasing this year that's behind the themes that you have already mentioned?\nSteveSmith: Well, I think it starts with kind of the fundamentals of our platform really, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks around available capacity. And it's not just the amount of capacity, it's the fact that we have it consistently across really all of our top markets. So historically, we've had some capacity, but it's really been in a couple of markets and to make sure that we're really accelerating were in that specific market. So now we have more opportunity, I think, across the portfolio to have better sales. And then as I look at the pipeline, the pipeline has been consistently strong, heading into the pandemic, but holding that strength and continuing even through the end of the year. So it's hard to foretell exactly what that pipeline will result in. Jeff has mentioned our guidance already. So I think I'll let that speak for itself. But we feel like between the volume of the pipeline, customers getting more, I think familiar, as I mentioned earlier with how they make these business decisions and navigate the complexities of hybrid multi cloud that the combination of all those things bodes well for the overall sales forecast for the year.\nDaveRodgers: Is there any evidence in there that you're losing more customers or winning more of those deals that you're pursuing? It sounds like the funnel is bigger, which is great. But some of those win versus loss metrics that you might track?\nSteveSmith: We track the win loss ratios very closely and try to manage beneath the numbers to find out where we can improve on that. There's a balance between, in some cases, winning too many versus obviously losing too many. If you're winning too many then maybe you're giving away pricing or doing something wrong. But we try to make sure we are targeting, first of all, the right customers to value our platform and then ensure that we are getting the most return for our shareholders at the same time, providing valuable service to our customers. So it's that balance of all three of those things that we're working towards. And overall, I would say that the sales team has gotten better and better over time as they've now got better in their skill set, but we've continued to try to, as I call it, deepen the moat on our competitiveness and what makes us unique compared to our peers out there. So I think that all adds up into us being more competitive and being able to win the right opportunities that truly do value our ecosystem. I don't know if that answers your question, but I guess the short answer is yes.\nDaveRodgers: Jeff, maybe on you. I think 12 of your leases make up is 26% of the revenues and 15% of square feet, that's kind of what you call that hyperscale. As we look out, either this year as part of the larger expirations or into the next year or two, do we see any of those at risk or any of those expiring?\nJeffFinnin: Yes. Obviously, it's a big percentage from a square foot perspective as you look at the number of leases there being the 12, as you pointed out. And as I sit here today, I don't think there's a significant risk given where they are on each of those. And it's just something we're going to have to watch closely as we work our way through the year. Obviously, one of those is included in our churn guidance for this year. So take that one out of the equation, the remaining 11 are the ones that I would refer to. And obviously, something that we'll continue to watch closely. I think we've always had a history of any time we see something on the horizon that is sizable like one of those, we'll try and give you guys some heads up on that if and when that becomes clearer. But at this point in time, we don't see anything that we need to raise at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColbySynesael: As it relates to SV7, do you feel that you can backfill that with just one or two customers, or is your current expectation to use that space more for retail deployments? And then as part of that, what have you actually assumed in your guidance as it relates to the potential backfill opportunity with SV7? In other words, does guidance assume zero revenue from that through the course of the year? Have you assumed that maybe by the midpoint of the year, you backfilled it? Just any color so we can get a sense of what the baseline assumption is in the guidance would be helpful. And then my second question has to do with margins. Margins are expected to be down about 80 basis points year-over-year 2021 versus 2020. Can you just give us a little bit of color of what's the primary driver of that and whether or not that might start to reverse as we move to the back half of this year and then into next year? Thank you.\nPaulSzurek: Our current plan is to backfill SV7 with one or two customers, and Jeff can confirm. But I believe there is some revenue from that in the guidance, but I know we don't give specifics about individual leases, and Jeff can confirm this as well. But margins are simply -- the good news is we got 40 megawatts of capacity that we can lease. But that has a margin impact, because with baking capacity, you're still paying all the expenses but without offsetting revenue. So there is definitely an opportunity to expand margins as we lease up that 40 megawatts.\nJeffFinnin: Colby, just to confirm, Paul has confirmed, we do have some level of revenue associated with SV7 in our guidance. And I would point you to it, it's probably in the back half of this year versus the first half. And then in terms of those margins, we do have some drag, especially here in the first half as we go through the lease-up of, for instance, CH2 where we're obviously incurring those expenses and not only operating expenses, but the additional property tax insurance expenses associated with bringing those on. And until we get those two, call it, roughly 35% lease is probably about the breakeven point for us. There's going to be some drag as we work through the bottom level of that J curve. And so we would expect those to improve over time as that asset and others lease up.\nPaulSzurek: It gives us an opportunity to accelerate our growth rate in the back half of the year if we're successful with our sales.\nColbySynesael: Would the margins also then subsequently go up in the back half of the year?\nPaulSzurek: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup.\nMichaelRollins: So just to follow-on that. Are those extra carrying expenses partly in the G&A line? Because I noticed in the guidance that the growth, I believe, of G&A was like 11%, I think at the midpoint. And just separately, different topic on the balance sheet, was curious if you could just provide a little bit more color of what the guidance infers for net debt leverage over the course of the year? Are you still trying to get below 5 times leverage net debt to EBITDA over time and over what time frame do you see that happening? Thanks.\nJeffFinnin: Mike, in terms of the carry cost that are impacting those margins, most of those carry costs are going to be up in our operating expenses line item, that's where our data center teams get aggregated in terms of the expense recognition. In terms of the G&A growth of 11%, basically, most of that is being driven by some noncash compensation increases. And then some of that's being driven by expected increases in our travel and entertainment, as we expect to get back to, I guess, some normal sense of the level of whatever that looks like in 2021. And just to give you some sense, we anticipate the first quarter to continue to be at some very low levels of travel. But as we work our way through the year, anticipating some of that to start coming back and being introduced into the business, and we'll just see how things perform is and whether or not things open up to that extent. But that gives you some idea of what's driving the G&A. In terms of leverage, we finished the year at 5.2 times. And if you think about 2021, based on our anticipated capital needs and the timing of that capital deployment, I would imagine we would oscillate somewhere between 5.2 and 5.4 times during 2021, as we work our way through the year. And so obviously, a topic we always talk with our Board about and us here at the management team as well as our Board, we're comfortable continuing to let that reside in those levels here in the near term. So that's kind of what we expect for 2021.\nMichaelRollins: If you wrap these kind of two questions together on the margin front with the balance sheet front, and you're looking at the FFO per share growth rate that's been below revenue for the last couple of years. When does that reverse in total? When you take into account what you're trying to do with the balance sheet with the operating business? When can FFO per share show the underlying operating and financial leverage that's typically built into the data center business model?\nPaulSzurek: I may be wrong about this, and Jeff can correct me. But I think because of the capital intensity of the data center business and you either have to issue shares or stock, that once you get to a certain level of maturity and occupancy, you're always going to see lower FFO per share growth, then you see an FFO growth, then you see revenue growth, because you've got to cover the cost of financing the capital expansion. We've certainly seen that as we've looked across the industry generally. But I do think, I mean, getting back to your point, Mike, it's a good one. And I'd circle back to the 40 megawatts versus 23 megawatts. We've just got more occupancy that we have the opportunity to fulfill. As we do that will have a positive impact on our margins and our growth rate and our flow through to FFO.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.\nNickDelDeo: First, just a follow-up on that leverage question. It sounds like you expect the leverage ratio to kind of remain in the same zone as it is today over the course of 2021. Now as we look out a little further and kind of bake in the potential cost of SV9, is there any potential for equity issuances or do you feel comfortable that, that would not be required?\nJeffFinnin: Nick, obviously, in 2021, it's not currently in our business plan just based upon capital needs and where our leverage is. Obviously, beyond that, it remains to be seen. But as Paul alluded to, we sit at 81.9% occupancy here at year end. And as we work to drive that north, call it, to somewhere in the mid to upper 80%, that EBITDA growth can drive not only a lot of value inside this organization but obviously, will help us with that leverage. And then as we continue to look out in terms of when we're going to need capital, whether it's for SV9 or some incremental computer rooms. But near term, most of our capital is going to be directed towards those second and third phases of some of the new builds we've just completed and the EBITDA growth relative to capital deployed in those scenarios are much, much higher EBITDA growth, resulting just because of the low levels of capital needed to bring that capacity to the market, since we've spent roughly 50% of it already. So I think that's where we are in the cycle. And we'll continue to disclose what we can as we get closer to the need for bringing on more capacity. So that's kind of how we're viewing things near term.\nNickDelDeo: And then maybe one more on Northern Virginia. I think you guys mentioned that leasing in that market was the best since -- I believe you said 2015. Can you comment on how you feel about the sustainability of that performance and how the return attributes of the deals you've been signing there have been trending since that's something you've noted has presented some challenges in the past?\nSteveSmith: Nick, yes, we're pleased with how 2020 ended up in Virginia. We had some strong leasing there. And if you look at the leasing, none of it is hyperscale. It's all retail and scale leasing, which is really the core of our business and where we've been focused over time. So really to execute well against that core piece of the business is great to see, given that that market is very much measured and oftentimes by hyperscale leasing. So we still have the ability to take down some of those larger leases if they fit the profile that we've discussed earlier, as far as those that add to the ecosystem and value the ecosystem. But overall, it seems like that market is stabilizing and we feel like we're in a good position to continue to execute on that retail scale, but also well positioned for the right types of larger leases that may come along.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.\nTimLong: Two, if I could. First one is a quick one. Just talk a little bit about the maintenance CapEx. It looks like it's spiking next year. Is that just some catch up or is there something else going on there? And then second, I just want to touch again on the connectivity focus. You mentioned a lot of initiatives that you guys have gone through. Could you just let us know kind of what other type of areas are there opportunities for CoreSite to expand those offerings? And in the areas where you have invested in better connectivity, what has that meant for you as far as churns, or churn, or win rates, or pricing, or anything -- any color you can give us on the benefits of that, that would be great. Thank you.\nJeffFinnin: Tim, let me just address the question on the maintenance CapEx, first of all. Yes, we are anticipating elevated maintenance CapEx for 2021. And what's really driving that inside the data center business is we're replacing a chiller facility in Boston that has hit the end of life. And so we're replacing and then enhancing that to handle the entire facility there, which should drive us some very good savings as we bring that on. And that will all occur here in the first half of 2021. Secondly, I just want to point out, there is some additional recurring CapEx that we've anticipated in our office business. Not something we talk about often here at CoreSite, but we have signed an office lease at SV1 in Downtown San Jose, which we are going to spend some dollars to bring that space up to what's needed before that tenant commences its lease here in the first half of 2021 as well. Steve?\nSteveSmith: As far as the connectivity solutions are concerned, Paul mentioned a little bit about this in his opening remarks as to some of the, I think, milestones that we've made during 2020 in attracting additional cloud providers, some of the enhancements to our peering exchange, higher speeds that we're able to accommodate customers, for example, on AWS Direct Connect in Chicago. Those are just some examples of what we've done already but I mean, as you mentioned, your question around win rates or churn and those kind of things. Last year, we announced that we implemented our Inter-Site Connectivity, which really connects all of our markets together. And we've seen some strong uptake from that, in some cases where we won opportunities because we had that service. So we continue to look at those types of services and how we can continue to enhance the OCX, for example, to provide more end to end provisioning of customers and the trade-offs of demand versus the cost to enhance some of those features. Those type of things, I think, are continuing to be top of mind for us and our customers. We announced earlier this year that we rolled out our DCI visibility to give customers visibility on as to what's going on in their environment over the portal, and that's been very well received. So it's all of those kind of things. It's really kind of easing the path for customers to become customers and making that interoperability a lot more seamless for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAriKlein: And maybe just going back to the churn and [indiscernible], it seems like if we adjust for some of the moving parts this year, it will be somewhere in the range of 5% to 7%. Is that kind of the right way to think about it moving forward beyond this year as far as churn?\nJeffFinnin: Ari, I think as you look at several of the years, since we basically come public in 2010, I mean, you saw churn ranging from, I think, one year, we were down at 5.5% and then, obviously, this year would have been high at 11.6%. But when you look at and take away some of the highs and lows, on average, we were somewhere right around 7.5% to 8% on a regular basis. And so that's the way I'd probably think of it, somewhere around 1% to 2% per quarter is really what we would classify as fairly typical for us. As you think about 2021, to give you some sense for where we see that, I would anticipate our churn being somewhere between 1% and 1.5% in each of the first and second quarters, and then it would be a little bit elevated in the back half, probably 2% to 2.5% in the back half of the year, as we have the one customer moving out and some in September and some in October. Just to give you some sense for how we think the year will shape up for 2021.\nAriKlein: And then maybe just on the capacity front, you seem to be in a much better position today than you were maybe last year. But how are you thinking about the need, or how much capacity kind of do you want to have on hand moving forward? A lot of it will obviously be dictated by the leasing that's done, but is there a right amount of capacity that you consistently want to have on hand and available?\nPaulSzurek: It's a good question, Ari. I think it's more looked at by market but I would say we're a little bit over what we would ideally want right now. And primarily, that's because we haven't been as successful out of the gate with CH2 as we would have liked to. We've gone into the reasons for that in the past. But we're still very happy with that asset and we think it's going to perform well, and it has a good enterprise pipeline. But so far it's been a little bit slower than we expected. Ideally, we'd lease up at a faster pace this year. And I think somewhere in the 25 to 30 megawatts of capacity plus the ability to expand in existing data centers with new computer rooms and ready to develop land so that we have the optionality to expand capacity, that's probably the right way to think about the business model for our current size.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan.\nRichardChoe: A lot of the business last year came from existing customers. For guidance this year, are you still expecting most of the business to come from existing, or is that mix going to change a little bit and how should we think about it going through the year?\nSteveSmith: As we mentioned on the call, I think we had 89% come from existing customers in the last Q. And that's not unnatural for us, I mean, which is really part of the reason why there's such a focus for me and my team on driving new logos, because as we win those new logos and they come in, the likelihood of them landing and expanding becomes much greater. So not relying on just the base to continue to expand over and over and over again. So the ratios are probably fairly consistent, although, we look to try to overweight more in that new logo category. But as you look over time, I think anywhere from 70% to 90% in expansion is not uncommon.\nRichardChoe: And then in terms of the small scale and retail, is there any difference on how quickly those signings turn to revenue, or are they both about the same time frame?\nSteveSmith: I would say they're both pretty similar, as you get to the higher end of the scale, those can be a bit more complex in private cages that take a little bit more time to deploy. But they're all relatively in the same time period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.\nFrankLouthan: I wanted to circle back again on the sales cycle a little bit. Can you give us a little more insight here. Is it a function of customers and how they're reacting broadly, or do you think it's something more specific to how you're trying to sell them? Are you trying to engage with larger initial deals, or workloads, or applications that are generally taking longer than the traditional mix that you've had with enterprise customers? Or is it just something about the market in general, are you seeing the sales cycles lengthen?\nSteveSmith: I'll just start, I guess, with the simple answer of yes. It's all of that. I will tell you that we are trying to get into sales cycles earlier, which is part of the reason they become protractive because we're in earlier. So therefore, we're in them longer. But they're also more complex, as I mentioned earlier. So as we look to really try to communicate our overall value and messaging to the marketplace around not just the nuts and bolts of the data center but the value that they can extract from the data center and the ecosystem that is embedded within it, that will hopefully allow us to position ourselves better with those enterprises earlier that may actually elongate those sales cycles as we've seen but hopefully, better position us for more opportunities and give us a better position at the table as they make those decisions.\nFrankLouthan: I mean had you identified where maybe you were missing out on this in the past, and at what point does this sort of normalize and result in maybe higher growth going forward?\nSteveSmith: Well, I think it continues to normalize. I mean, it's hard to know what normal is in today's environment. But I think the process, as I mentioned earlier, has become more normalized. It's still a long process. And frankly, we still have more work to do with our sales team to get better and better at this and get better at our messaging. And as I mentioned earlier, try to deepen our moat on our value. So I don't think it's a static thing that we ever say mission accomplished. It's always trying to get better at trying to get in more deals and work them more efficiently. So it's hard to say that you can expect the status quo going forward because I don't think there ever will be in the high tech sector.\nPaulSzurek: I would only add that some of our most valuable customers that Steve and his team have brought in and added, which have these some of the longer sales cycles are the ones who are going to come in, and they're going to use multiple clouds, multiple networks, probably some of the cloud adjacent storage and other cloud adjacent utilities and they're moving typically out of a traditional kind of on premises environment. So there's just a lot more moving parts for them and a lot more work with solution partners and our solution architects to make sure we get their initial deployment and setup right, so that they can have the ability to expand and add new features as they grow into their hybrid multi cloud architecture.\nFrankLouthan: And have you seen any incremental activity or interest from any of the Chinese hyperscalers since November?\nSteveSmith: Nothing that's abnormal, I would say, pretty consistent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavidGuarino: I noticed CoreSite stopped providing property level disclosure, and they now show market level disclosure in the supplemental. Can you just talk about why the company thinks providing investors with less disclosures is fine in the portfolio? Is it the best way to communicate the story?\nJeffFinnin: Every year we go through a process of looking at the information we disclose and how it's being received and how it's being utilized. And we're always looking for ways to enhance the message by giving good and many times more transparency in certain situations like this one. We felt summarizing the information just felt and gave, and tried to simplify the message. We did the same thing in our debt disclosure table. But the debt, you can go to our 10-K and get all the nitty gritty details that you need. And as Steve pointed out, adding some additional disclosures around how we're managing the business from a sales perspective, we think helps with transparency and aligns it much better. So we're always looking for ways to improve upon it. Specific to your question, trying to simplify it, David. And if there's something in there that's meaningful and is causing some real issues, let me know what it is, and we'll see if we can help you out.\nDavidGuarino: Okay, that's great. And maybe we can talk offline about that. And just a second question on the Chicago market, we didn't touch a lot on that, but still limited activity there again this quarter. But it looks like there were two pretty large leases signed by some private data center operators during Q4. So could you maybe give us an idea, I guess, of how you view the supply and demand dynamics in that market and then just kind of your expectations surrounding when that space might be leased in CH2?\nPaulSzurek: So we're positive on the market. It was in 2020, much more almost entirely a hyperscaler market. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, both of those two leases you mentioned were with one hyperscale customer. But it's traditionally been a very strong enterprise market. We actually had good leasing in that market. Our leasing in Chicago was our best since 2016. It was 19% ahead of 2019 levels. We brought our occupancy in CH1 up from 81% to 87%. And we have a good funnel of enterprises with larger scale requirements that hopefully will start bearing fruit this year in 2021. Steve, anything you'd add?\nSteveSmith: No, just minor correction. It was 13% over 2019, but in the ballpark, to be accurate. But yes, it was a good year. We'd like to do more. I mean, I would like to see more. We've got a beautiful building there that now we can extend all the value that we've had, our 427 LaSalle location and we're optimistic about the opportunity there. But as Paul mentioned, we did have good leasing and we expect that to accelerate as we go into 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho Securities.\nOmotayoOkusanya: In your earlier comments, you discussed the proposed New Jersey tax on financial service transactions kind of causing some delay or some uncertainty in the New Jersey, New York market. Could you talk a little bit about, one, what the latest is with that proposed tax? And then two, if you've seen any other kind of major markets thinking of doing something like that as all these municipalities are all trying to shore up their revenues post the pandemic?\nPaulSzurek: So we don't have any real updated information. It almost seems like there's a little bit of pause. The proposal has been reduced but hasn't gone away completely and who knows it may be tied to bigger fiscal things going on relative to Washington and the COVID Relief/Stimulus Bill, but honestly I don't have very good tea leaves into the political situation tale. So I can't really address that. We haven't seen anything similar in other markets. I recall vaguely three, four years ago, Chicago floated something like that. And then when they saw what the impact would be on business in their state and their community, they shut it down. So I mean, I think all these municipalities are focused on the fact that, that business and that activity is portable to other jurisdictions. And so they have to make a judgment as to whether they're cutting off the nose to spite their face, if they implement a tax like that.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichaelFunk: Quickly, circling back interconnection of your comments earlier, hoping you can pull apart on what's in your guidance for 2021. You mentioned that a number of moving pieces there, volume growth helped in 2020, migration to higher capacity, price increases. So does your '21 guidance, does that assume lower volume growth, lower level of migration, pruning by customers or less ability to increase pricing?\nJeffFinnin: Michael, in terms of 2021 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our overall volume increases in 2020 were 7.7%. We actually expect volume increases for 2021 to be around 7%, which is right in line with where our revenue growth is guided to at this point in time. So what we're not certain of and haven't baked into the guidance is how much incremental revenue growth we would receive from customers as they're rolling over on their new lease terms or any migration to those higher priced products. We saw a lot of that activity in 2020 and at this point, have expected that to be fairly muted for 2021. And we'll just see how that rolls out as we go through the year.\nMichaelFunk: And then one more, if I could, on capital allocation. You slowed the dividend growth recently. You gave a target for leverage for 2021. What does it take to get back to the historic level of dividend growth?\nJeffFinnin: Well, I would simply say we continue to target that AFFO payout ratio of somewhere around 90%, 92%. And you can see we're just a little bit higher than that currently over the last trailing 12 months. But I don't anticipate that payout ratio increasing, that's the level we're comfortable with at this point in time. And so dividend increases are going to be very highly correlated to cash flow growth. So I would say look closely at the AFFO growth and that's really going to give you a better indication on what that dividend growth is going to look like longer term.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Paul Szurek for any closing comments.\nPaul Szurek: Thank you. Thank you all for your interest and your time and learning more about CoreSite today. I'll tell you I learned many good things about our team during the challenges of 2021. My colleagues have an increased appreciation for how conscientious, agile and innovative they are, not only to make the adjustments necessary to succeed in 2020, but to continue to build a better platform for how we go forward. They make me very optimistic that we can perform well with our strong business model and the abundant capacity that we have coming into this year. So I look forward to 2021 and hope you all have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Paul Szurek",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover our 2020 highlights and discuss our 2021 priorities. I'll be followed by Steve and Jeff's more in depth discussion of sales and financial matters. Our 2020 highlights include new and expansion sales of $37.6 million of annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. Operating revenues of $606.8 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth. FFO per share of $5.31, representing a year-over-year increase of $0.21 per share or 4.1%. Delivery of 192,000 net rentable square feet or 22 megawatts of total new capacity, including the opening of two new data centers and seven-nines of power and cooling uptime. These achievements enabled us to execute on our 2020 goals of developing more capacity and completing projects on time, translating new and vacant capacity into sales, attracting quality new logos that value our campus ecosystems, thoughtfully expanding our products to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and maintaining high levels of facility performance and customer service. Overall, I am pleased with the team's ability to successfully execute these priorities amidst the backdrop of the global pandemic. We delivered SV8 Phase 3, NY2 Phase 3 and the first phases of new data centers at CH2 and LA3. As a result, we finished 2020 with 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell compared to 23 megawatts at the end of 2019. Examples of translating new capacity into higher sales included leasing 75% of SV8 Phase 3 and 80% of LA3 Phase 1 and accelerating leasing in Northern Virginia, our best year in terms of annualized GAAP rent in that market since 2015. While sales cycles for enterprises were elongated probably due to the economic and other uncertainties related to the virus, we continue to attract high quality new logos, especially in the financial services industry at NY2. We also expanded our connectivity options during the year, including adding Google Partner Interconnect and Oracle Cloud infrastructure to the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange, increasing bandwidth for AWS hosted connections on the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange in our Chicago campus; adding multimarket peering to our enhanced NE2 exchange; and as recently announced, adding access to Google Cloud using dedicated interconnect in Northern Virginia. In addition to these 2020 accomplishments, as we announced earlier this week, we appointed a new director to our Board, Mr. Michael Milligan. Mike brings us valuable telecommunications experience as well as noteworthy Board experience, which will be a tremendous asset to CoreSite as we continue our pattern of expanding our talent pool through increasing diversity. I also want to thank Jim Atwood and David Thompson for their Board service over the last 10 years. They have both served since the company's IPO in September 2010, and their contributions were many. Jim and David will continue to serve until our annual meeting in May. But as part of our periodic Board rotation, will voluntarily not seek reelection this year. We are very grateful for the service they have provided to CoreSite, its shareholders and its employees and customers and wish them the best in their future endeavors. As we move forward to 2021, our goals are similar to our 2020 goals as we build on last year's successes. Our ability to meet those goals is enhanced by greater available capacity to sell and the strong enterprise funnel that has been building up due to elongated sales cycles we saw for the enterprise vertical in 2020. One notable difference is that while we will continue being proactive for future developments, we do not need and do not have any new ground up data centers planned to come online in 2021. In closing, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us, and we believe our priorities and our other operating objectives will continue to drive long-term value to our customers, employees and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. I do think we're starting to see some movement and it's hard to generalize because it's idiosyncratic to so many customers and even some regions like, for example, I think in New York, in New Jersey, we would have had better performance if it were for the uncertainty about the proposed transaction tax and some other industries things were moving along and then suddenly some additional acquisitions were taking place. And so the opportunity had to be resized. But for a lot of the customers, it's just them working through what their economic future looks like. There are growth opportunities. For some, it's accelerated digital transformation. For others that's accelerated the process of outlining and planning for digital transformation, but not quite gotten to the point where they're ready to pull the trigger. I do think with 2021, started off a little bit -- it wasn't exactly like the calendar turned and everything turned rosy and there were some bumps nationally and economically in the first month or so. But there appears to be some strong economic optimism going forward. And I think that, that will have a positive impact on sales cycles. Steve, anything you'd add? We look at a lot of things, as we've said in the past, and our guidance is strategic fit, which really means what type of revenue synergies can we generate an above standard growth, if we do make the investment and then return on invested capital. Does it benefit our shareholders in the intermediate and long term, and hopefully, the short-term as well or does it not? We're not averse to partnering if that makes sense and the opportunity is there. But generally, that can be more complicated than it sounds at first glance. Again, we've looked at a lot of things. And when those criteria are met, we'll do something. When they're not, we won't. So I'll let Steve address supply and demand in that market. Although I will tell you, I feel good about it. SV9, as we said last quarter, we are targeting having our permits and everything by the end of the first quarter. So far, the processes are trending that way. But in that market, and Jon, you probably know the dynamics of permitting and power there as well as anybody. You can't really say it's done until it's done. So we still have a couple more things we've got to finish up. And hopefully, we'll get those finished up and have it shovel ready by the end of this quarter. We have. I don't think anyone can say right now that with certainty, they know exactly what's going to evolve. But our expectation is that there's minimal exposure for us of workloads that are currently in our data centers going to the edge exclusively. And there's probably a good opportunity for our data centers as core peering places in the central markets to benefit it through the increased products and services that are offered at the further edge through 5G, IoT, things like that, just because of -- the beautiful thing about data is that it works when there's a lot of it pooled together, and you'll see a lot of that necessary for those applications. So that's our high-level view of it. We continue to monitor it closely and evaluate potential product help in those areas and partners to work with. But at a high level, we think it will be ultimately beneficial. Jordan, current thoughts haven't changed. We're still optimistic about backfilling that space in SV7. I mean, we typically don't give previews of when like something might be signed. But when it is signed, we'll announce it. Whether LA4\u2026 Jordan, the only thing I'd add to what Jeff said is that the categories of customers that drove churn over the last couple of years are now a very, very small percentage of our portfolio, and those are business models that have been especially disrupted by cloud. I mean, we've had numbers that low or even lower in prior years. And again, it relates to the cyclicality of some of these business models or actually, I should say, the secular changes that affect some of these business models. Again, that's our guidance. We wouldn't put it out there if we didn't feel that it was the right range to put out there. Well, I mean, it depends on which history. And as I said, we certainly have numbers that low in previous years. Our current plan is to backfill SV7 with one or two customers, and Jeff can confirm. But I believe there is some revenue from that in the guidance, but I know we don't give specifics about individual leases, and Jeff can confirm this as well. But margins are simply -- the good news is we got 40 megawatts of capacity that we can lease. But that has a margin impact, because with baking capacity, you're still paying all the expenses but without offsetting revenue. So there is definitely an opportunity to expand margins as we lease up that 40 megawatts. It gives us an opportunity to accelerate our growth rate in the back half of the year if we're successful with our sales. Yes. I may be wrong about this, and Jeff can correct me. But I think because of the capital intensity of the data center business and you either have to issue shares or stock, that once you get to a certain level of maturity and occupancy, you're always going to see lower FFO per share growth, then you see an FFO growth, then you see revenue growth, because you've got to cover the cost of financing the capital expansion. We've certainly seen that as we've looked across the industry generally. But I do think, I mean, getting back to your point, Mike, it's a good one. And I'd circle back to the 40 megawatts versus 23 megawatts. We've just got more occupancy that we have the opportunity to fulfill. As we do that will have a positive impact on our margins and our growth rate and our flow through to FFO. It's a good question, Ari. I think it's more looked at by market but I would say we're a little bit over what we would ideally want right now. And primarily, that's because we haven't been as successful out of the gate with CH2 as we would have liked to. We've gone into the reasons for that in the past. But we're still very happy with that asset and we think it's going to perform well, and it has a good enterprise pipeline. But so far it's been a little bit slower than we expected. Ideally, we'd lease up at a faster pace this year. And I think somewhere in the 25 to 30 megawatts of capacity plus the ability to expand in existing data centers with new computer rooms and ready to develop land so that we have the optionality to expand capacity, that's probably the right way to think about the business model for our current size. I would only add that some of our most valuable customers that Steve and his team have brought in and added, which have these some of the longer sales cycles are the ones who are going to come in, and they're going to use multiple clouds, multiple networks, probably some of the cloud adjacent storage and other cloud adjacent utilities and they're moving typically out of a traditional kind of on premises environment. So there's just a lot more moving parts for them and a lot more work with solution partners and our solution architects to make sure we get their initial deployment and setup right, so that they can have the ability to expand and add new features as they grow into their hybrid multi cloud architecture. So we're positive on the market. It was in 2020, much more almost entirely a hyperscaler market. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, both of those two leases you mentioned were with one hyperscale customer. But it's traditionally been a very strong enterprise market. We actually had good leasing in that market. Our leasing in Chicago was our best since 2016. It was 19% ahead of 2019 levels. We brought our occupancy in CH1 up from 81% to 87%. And we have a good funnel of enterprises with larger scale requirements that hopefully will start bearing fruit this year in 2021. Steve, anything you'd add? So we don't have any real updated information. It almost seems like there's a little bit of pause. The proposal has been reduced but hasn't gone away completely and who knows it may be tied to bigger fiscal things going on relative to Washington and the COVID Relief/Stimulus Bill, but honestly I don't have very good tea leaves into the political situation tale. So I can't really address that. We haven't seen anything similar in other markets. I recall vaguely three, four years ago, Chicago floated something like that. And then when they saw what the impact would be on business in their state and their community, they shut it down. So I mean, I think all these municipalities are focused on the fact that, that business and that activity is portable to other jurisdictions. And so they have to make a judgment as to whether they're cutting off the nose to spite their face, if they implement a tax like that. Thank you. Thank you all for your interest and your time and learning more about CoreSite today. I'll tell you I learned many good things about our team during the challenges of 2021. My colleagues have an increased appreciation for how conscientious, agile and innovative they are, not only to make the adjustments necessary to succeed in 2020, but to continue to build a better platform for how we go forward. They make me very optimistic that we can perform well with our strong business model and the abundant capacity that we have coming into this year. So I look forward to 2021 and hope you all have a great rest of your day. Thank you."

            "name": "Steve Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter sales results and then talk further about some of our key 2020 successes and drivers. Turning to our quarterly sales results. We delivered new and expansion sales of $9.7 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Please note that as of this earnings report and going forward, we have modified our reporting of new and expansion leases signed by deployment size included on Page 14 of our supplemental information. This revision reports our signed leases per period based on leased kilowatts rather than net rentable square feet. The change more closely aligns with how we manage sales activity internally and it is intended to provide greater visibility. New and expansion sales for the quarter included $4.4 million of annualized GAAP rent from retail leases, $3.7 million of GAAP rent from small scale leases and $1.5 million of GAAP rent from large scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 54,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annual GAAP rate of $180 per square foot and included an impressive 45 new logos, all with opportunities for future growth, our highest count since the first quarter of 2018. Looking more closely at new logos, the 45 new logos represents $0.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 8.5% of our total annualized GAAP rents signed during the quarter and were strongest in the enterprise vertical. Enhancing the ecosystem while diversifying the customer base through attracting and winning new customers remains a key area of focus, and it's great to see 45 new brands become part of that story. Next, I'll share some highlights from our sales wins. As Paul mentioned, during 2020, we executed $37.6 million of new and expansion sales in annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. It also represents an 18% increase in retail and small scale leasing compared to 2019. Driving our new and expansion sales this year were several key factors, including more available contiguous capacity to meet a broader range of customer requirements, ongoing strength in attracting and winning high quality new logo sales, strategic expansions from existing customers and a robust sustainable sales pipeline that includes customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation by deploying high performance hybrid cloud architectures. Let me expand on these drivers. Our new logo annualized GAAP rent for the full year was $4.3 million, which demonstrates the progress made against our goal to attract high quality new customers that value our platform, which will help drive future growth. As to strategic expansions with existing customers, our existing customers accounted for approximately 89% of the full year 2020 annualized GAAP rent signed, including expansions into additional markets. In summary, we are pleased with our sales execution during the year. We exited 2020 with ample contiguous capacity to support future sales opportunities as illustrated by the new capacity graph at the top of Page 18 of our supplemental information. We're optimistic about the fundamental market drivers supporting our strategy. The increasing need for enterprises to leverage technology in a seamless, high performance, hybrid multi cloud environment bodes well for the unique position of our network dense, cloud enabled campuses located in top enterprise markets. These market drivers align well with our ongoing product and services development, which are targeted easing the transition of enterprise with becoming customers by making data integration and application interoperability seamless. Our focus going forward will be to continue improving our ability to help customers solve their IT challenges as they address the changing dynamic needs of their industries and their customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. No, I think you covered it well, Paul. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we feel like we're well positioned for the overall market trends, and that is really, any enterprise out there has become more interested in how they leverage technology to run their business. And the hybrid multi cloud environment is becoming more and more commonplace for a lot of enterprises. It is complex as to how they navigate that and we're working to try to make that as simple for them as possible, but that's part of what drives that elongated cycle. So it's all the things that Paul mentioned as well as just the overall complexity of how they manage that migration. So overall, I think customers are getting used to whatever the new normal is and working through those complications, but we feel like we're well positioned to support that. I guess, I'd just add as far as trending and where we're seeing customer adoption and so forth. I mean, we're fortunate in that we were one of the -- in fact, I think, the first public data center provider to offer an OCX type of offering and Open Cloud Exchange, where it's basically an Ethernet backbone that allows customers to virtually connect to many different services on that backbone. We've made significant enhancements to that over the last several years. That's positioned us well for really where we see the trend going in the future, which is really kind of that end to end serviceability over SDN like network. So I think you'll continue to see more adoption of that and more services come available on that same platform, and that's part of what we're driving towards our product development. And I would just add, as far as the overall supply demand dynamics are concerned, we continue to see strong demand in the market. And so we're bullish on where we're heading with those investments, where we sit with our overall capacity and pipeline in that space. So overall, we're confident with where we sit today. And I guess the last thing I would just add there is the edge can be defined by a lot of different people in a lot of different ways. And we feel like we're well positioned in a lot of edge markets. I mean, if you look at the key metro areas that we're in, where there's a lot of eyeballs, a lot of enterprises that are in very low latency proximity to our data center campuses. In many definitions, that is edge because we're right next to where those eyeballs and enterprises locate. And the other thing, I guess, I would just add is roughly 30% of our base renewing in the year is not a normal. It's very typical for us actually. And if you look at the average length of our leases of roughly three to four years, that's what you can expect, I think. Well, I think it starts with kind of the fundamentals of our platform really, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks around available capacity. And it's not just the amount of capacity, it's the fact that we have it consistently across really all of our top markets. So historically, we've had some capacity, but it's really been in a couple of markets and to make sure that we're really accelerating were in that specific market. So now we have more opportunity, I think, across the portfolio to have better sales. And then as I look at the pipeline, the pipeline has been consistently strong, heading into the pandemic, but holding that strength and continuing even through the end of the year. So it's hard to foretell exactly what that pipeline will result in. Jeff has mentioned our guidance already. So I think I'll let that speak for itself. But we feel like between the volume of the pipeline, customers getting more, I think familiar, as I mentioned earlier with how they make these business decisions and navigate the complexities of hybrid multi cloud that the combination of all those things bodes well for the overall sales forecast for the year. We track the win loss ratios very closely and try to manage beneath the numbers to find out where we can improve on that. There's a balance between, in some cases, winning too many versus obviously losing too many. If you're winning too many then maybe you're giving away pricing or doing something wrong. But we try to make sure we are targeting, first of all, the right customers to value our platform and then ensure that we are getting the most return for our shareholders at the same time, providing valuable service to our customers. So it's that balance of all three of those things that we're working towards. And overall, I would say that the sales team has gotten better and better over time as they've now got better in their skill set, but we've continued to try to, as I call it, deepen the moat on our competitiveness and what makes us unique compared to our peers out there. So I think that all adds up into us being more competitive and being able to win the right opportunities that truly do value our ecosystem. I don't know if that answers your question, but I guess the short answer is yes. Nick, yes, we're pleased with how 2020 ended up in Virginia. We had some strong leasing there. And if you look at the leasing, none of it is hyperscale. It's all retail and scale leasing, which is really the core of our business and where we've been focused over time. So really to execute well against that core piece of the business is great to see, given that that market is very much measured and oftentimes by hyperscale leasing. So we still have the ability to take down some of those larger leases if they fit the profile that we've discussed earlier, as far as those that add to the ecosystem and value the ecosystem. But overall, it seems like that market is stabilizing and we feel like we're in a good position to continue to execute on that retail scale, but also well positioned for the right types of larger leases that may come along. As far as the connectivity solutions are concerned, Paul mentioned a little bit about this in his opening remarks as to some of the, I think, milestones that we've made during 2020 in attracting additional cloud providers, some of the enhancements to our peering exchange, higher speeds that we're able to accommodate customers, for example, on AWS Direct Connect in Chicago. Those are just some examples of what we've done already but I mean, as you mentioned, your question around win rates or churn and those kind of things. Last year, we announced that we implemented our Inter-Site Connectivity, which really connects all of our markets together. And we've seen some strong uptake from that, in some cases where we won opportunities because we had that service. So we continue to look at those types of services and how we can continue to enhance the OCX, for example, to provide more end to end provisioning of customers and the trade-offs of demand versus the cost to enhance some of those features. Those type of things, I think, are continuing to be top of mind for us and our customers. We announced earlier this year that we rolled out our DCI visibility to give customers visibility on as to what's going on in their environment over the portal, and that's been very well received. So it's all of those kind of things. It's really kind of easing the path for customers to become customers and making that interoperability a lot more seamless for them. As we mentioned on the call, I think we had 89% come from existing customers in the last Q. And that's not unnatural for us, I mean, which is really part of the reason why there's such a focus for me and my team on driving new logos, because as we win those new logos and they come in, the likelihood of them landing and expanding becomes much greater. So not relying on just the base to continue to expand over and over and over again. So the ratios are probably fairly consistent, although, we look to try to overweight more in that new logo category. But as you look over time, I think anywhere from 70% to 90% in expansion is not uncommon. I would say they're both pretty similar, as you get to the higher end of the scale, those can be a bit more complex in private cages that take a little bit more time to deploy. But they're all relatively in the same time period. I'll just start, I guess, with the simple answer of yes. It's all of that. I will tell you that we are trying to get into sales cycles earlier, which is part of the reason they become protractive because we're in earlier. So therefore, we're in them longer. But they're also more complex, as I mentioned earlier. So as we look to really try to communicate our overall value and messaging to the marketplace around not just the nuts and bolts of the data center but the value that they can extract from the data center and the ecosystem that is embedded within it, that will hopefully allow us to position ourselves better with those enterprises earlier that may actually elongate those sales cycles as we've seen but hopefully, better position us for more opportunities and give us a better position at the table as they make those decisions. Well, I think it continues to normalize. I mean, it's hard to know what normal is in today's environment. But I think the process, as I mentioned earlier, has become more normalized. It's still a long process. And frankly, we still have more work to do with our sales team to get better and better at this and get better at our messaging. And as I mentioned earlier, try to deepen our moat on our value. So I don't think it's a static thing that we ever say mission accomplished. It's always trying to get better at trying to get in more deals and work them more efficiently. So it's hard to say that you can expect the status quo going forward because I don't think there ever will be in the high tech sector. Nothing that's abnormal, I would say, pretty consistent. No, just minor correction. It was 13% over 2019, but in the ballpark, to be accurate. But yes, it was a good year. We'd like to do more. I mean, I would like to see more. We've got a beautiful building there that now we can extend all the value that we've had, our 427 LaSalle location and we're optimistic about the opportunity there. But as Paul mentioned, we did have good leasing and we expect that to accelerate as we go into 2021."

            "name": "Jeff Finnin",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, discuss our balance sheet, including leverage and liquidity and conclude with our financial outlook and guidance for 2021. Looking at our financial results. For the full year, operating revenues grew to $606.8 million, a 6% year-over-year increase, including interconnection revenue of $84.1 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $324.5 million, an increase of 5.3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, consistent with the trailing 12 month average. FFO per share was $5.31, which represents 4.1% year-over-year growth. And we declared dividends of $4.89 per share, representing an increase of 2.7%. For the quarter, operating revenues were $154.9 million, which represents 6.1% growth year-over-year and consistent sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 12.7% year-over-year, 3.8% sequentially. Customer lease renewals, equaling $15.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents a cash rent mark-to-market of 1%, and we reported churn of 5.4%. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our revenue backlog as of December 31st consisted of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or $21.4 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. We expect approximately 60% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $82.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.7% year-over-year and 1.6% sequentially. Net income was $0.46 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.05 year-over-year and $0.04 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.34, an increase of $0.04 or 3.1% year-over-year and $0.01 or 0.8% sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.2 times at year end, slightly lower-than-anticipated and inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 5.1 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $301 million of liquidity, providing us the ability to fully fund our 2021 business plan. In addition, we finished the year with 91% fixed rate debt. We expect our fixed rate debt percentage to decrease to approximately 80% by the end of 2021, absent any new debt or derivative instruments. I will now address our 2021 guidance. We ended the year at 81.9% occupancy in our data center portfolio and 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell. In addition, we have the ability to bring on consistent amounts of capacity through incremental computer rooms and infrastructure development within our existing data centers as needed and as anticipated absorption dictates. We reported elevated churn during 2020, slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance, with Q4 results slightly elevated due to a couple of customer move outs, accelerating their timing from Q1 2021. The following 2021 guidance is based on our outlook on current economic conditions, internal assumptions about our customer base and our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets. It does not include the impact of any future financing, investment or disposition activities beyond what has already been disclosed. I will cover the highlights of our 2021 guidance, but I will refer you to our complete guidance on Page 22 of our fourth quarter supplemental information for further details. Operating revenue is estimated to be $642 million to $652 million, representing 6.6% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. Our 2021 churn is estimated to be 6.5% to 8.5%, inclusive of the 200 basis points related to that specific Bay Area customer during the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect cash rent growth on data center renewals to be 0% to 2% growth for the year. Interconnection revenue is estimated to be $87 million to $93 million, representing 7% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $336 million to $346 million, which implies a 52.7% adjusted EBITDA margin and 5.1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. FFO per diluted share and operating unit is estimated to be $5.42 to $5.52, reflecting 3% growth at the midpoint. Based on our expectations and estimates related to leasing, net absorption and timing of commencements, we anticipate the year-over-year growth rates to accelerate in the second half of 2021 for revenue adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share. Lastly, capital expenditures are consistent with our original guidance provided in October and estimated to be $185 million to $225 million. In closing, we are pleased with our execution in 2020 and we look forward to the opportunities ahead to further help our customers solve their it needs and challenges as they accelerate their digital transformation. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Sami, yes, just to confirm, you heard correctly in regards to the commencement of the backlog. So again, 60% Q1, about 40% in Q2. And in terms of sales execution, I think is what you were gearing your question around. We would clearly believe that kind of, as Paul alluded to, that we would have good execution throughout the year. The only thing that I would add is we'll see some benefits from an expense perspective. If you just see the percentages we're guiding to, I think we'll see some decreases in our overall sales as a percentage of revenue during the year. I don't know if that's directly addressing your question, Sami or was there something else we could add? No, it's going to require some meaningful sales execution just as every year requires it. And I think when you look at where we ended the year this past year at just below $40 million, I think realistically, we would expect and anticipate somewhere being north of that $40 million as we think about this year, just to give you some idea. Obviously, I don't want to get into too many specifics because we don't generally guide to that. But that gives you some sense for what we're thinking about as we head into 2021. Let me give you a little bit of color, Jon, and then I'll ask Steve just to add any incremental color he sees obviously on the front lines. But when you look at 2020 and from a volume perspective, overall volume increases was about 7.7% for 2020. And as you saw on the revenue, overall revenue increases year-over-year was 11%. So those percentages are fairly consistent with generally what drives that revenue increases, which is about two thirds coming from volume increases, about another third of it coming from customers migrating from lower priced to higher-priced products and some price increases as customers roll or just general price increases. So that relationship has stayed fairly consistent in 2020. We saw really good growth in the fiber cross connects last year as well as our Open Cloud Exchange. And I think some of that may have been spawned on by the pandemic that we walked through and lived through in 2020. Obviously, when you look at our guide for this year, we're guiding to growth of about 7%. And so I think it's unclear at this point whether we're going to see that continued level of volume increases for 2021, it's something we're going to watch closely. But at this point, we think it will moderate slightly just given where we've guided the street to at this point in time. Steve, anything else? Nate, I'll just offer a little bit there. Obviously, the pricing in full you're looking at is on a per square foot basis. And on the renewal pricing, when you look at what we did this year, the dollars per square foot were compressed largely due to the density inside those deployments. So the density really plays into the fact and when we're obviously competing and having those conversations with customers, pricing is going to be on a kilowatt basis. And so I wouldn't read too much into that on a per square foot basis. There's just a lot of variables, density being the largest in terms of what's going to ultimately resolve in that pricing. But obviously, as we head into 2021, you saw where we ended 2020 right about in the middle of our guidance for our mark to market at 0.8%, and we expect to be somewhere in between that 0% and 2% as we work our way through this year. And then obviously, we'll continue to watch it beyond that and give you additional color as needed. As it relates to the churn in the fourth quarter, we had about 60 to 70 basis points incremental churn in the fourth quarter that really moved essentially from January of '21 when we anticipated up to December here in the fourth quarter of this last year. So not a real big economic impact. It really is just a shift in the timing. Again, that was about 60 to 70 basis points. And it was really with three customers, one of them happened to be in probably the largest percentage. It was just another reseller that was in our portfolio that we had anticipated to move out and did it roughly 30 days prior to when we anticipated. And so hopefully, that gives you some additional color. And then what was the second half of the question, Jordan? No, it's as it relates to LA4, I appreciate you picking up on that in some of the disclosures there. Obviously, that LA4 is a location that's in close proximity to LA1 and LA2 and LA3. And obviously, our objective is to drive business into our owned assets and there's just much better longer term, better assets to drive business to. And we're currently in process migrating over all those businesses that we can from LA4 into LA2. And so we've already done some of that. And our team in LA is working on getting the lion's share of that completed here this year. But that churn that I commented earlier had nothing to do with LA4. At this point, that's still in process and we'll work through that in 2021. Well, as you think about it, obviously, as we've pointed out, we've got about 200 of that coming from the single customer at SV7, that will occur in the second half of this year. And in terms of what are we doing to get our arms around it, I can tell you that between my team and Steve's team, it's something that we address on a weekly basis, trying to continue to look as far forward as we can, both through conversations and relationships we're having as well as looking at incremental data around each of those deployments to better understand ultimately what that information is telling us on customer behavior to help give us a point on which direction those are ultimately going to go. And from a customer service perspective, it's always been a very high part of our business, and I would say we're continuing to even elevate it to a higher level under the guide of our operations team, and it's something we're continuing to get out in front of. We want to make sure we retain those customers every time we can and when it makes sense. And hopefully, avoid any of the surprises like we had in the past. But based on where we sit today and what we know today, we think that 6.5% to 8.5% for 2021 is a good number and is in right in line with what we anticipated. Yes. Obviously, it's a big percentage from a square foot perspective as you look at the number of leases there being the 12, as you pointed out. And as I sit here today, I don't think there's a significant risk given where they are on each of those. And it's just something we're going to have to watch closely as we work our way through the year. Obviously, one of those is included in our churn guidance for this year. So take that one out of the equation, the remaining 11 are the ones that I would refer to. And obviously, something that we'll continue to watch closely. I think we've always had a history of any time we see something on the horizon that is sizable like one of those, we'll try and give you guys some heads up on that if and when that becomes clearer. But at this point in time, we don't see anything that we need to raise at this point in time. Colby, just to confirm, Paul has confirmed, we do have some level of revenue associated with SV7 in our guidance. And I would point you to it, it's probably in the back half of this year versus the first half. And then in terms of those margins, we do have some drag, especially here in the first half as we go through the lease-up of, for instance, CH2 where we're obviously incurring those expenses and not only operating expenses, but the additional property tax insurance expenses associated with bringing those on. And until we get those two, call it, roughly 35% lease is probably about the breakeven point for us. There's going to be some drag as we work through the bottom level of that J curve. And so we would expect those to improve over time as that asset and others lease up. Mike, in terms of the carry cost that are impacting those margins, most of those carry costs are going to be up in our operating expenses line item, that's where our data center teams get aggregated in terms of the expense recognition. In terms of the G&A growth of 11%, basically, most of that is being driven by some noncash compensation increases. And then some of that's being driven by expected increases in our travel and entertainment, as we expect to get back to, I guess, some normal sense of the level of whatever that looks like in 2021. And just to give you some sense, we anticipate the first quarter to continue to be at some very low levels of travel. But as we work our way through the year, anticipating some of that to start coming back and being introduced into the business, and we'll just see how things perform is and whether or not things open up to that extent. But that gives you some idea of what's driving the G&A. In terms of leverage, we finished the year at 5.2 times. And if you think about 2021, based on our anticipated capital needs and the timing of that capital deployment, I would imagine we would oscillate somewhere between 5.2 and 5.4 times during 2021, as we work our way through the year. And so obviously, a topic we always talk with our Board about and us here at the management team as well as our Board, we're comfortable continuing to let that reside in those levels here in the near term. So that's kind of what we expect for 2021. Nick, obviously, in 2021, it's not currently in our business plan just based upon capital needs and where our leverage is. Obviously, beyond that, it remains to be seen. But as Paul alluded to, we sit at 81.9% occupancy here at year end. And as we work to drive that north, call it, to somewhere in the mid to upper 80%, that EBITDA growth can drive not only a lot of value inside this organization but obviously, will help us with that leverage. And then as we continue to look out in terms of when we're going to need capital, whether it's for SV9 or some incremental computer rooms. But near term, most of our capital is going to be directed towards those second and third phases of some of the new builds we've just completed and the EBITDA growth relative to capital deployed in those scenarios are much, much higher EBITDA growth, resulting just because of the low levels of capital needed to bring that capacity to the market, since we've spent roughly 50% of it already. So I think that's where we are in the cycle. And we'll continue to disclose what we can as we get closer to the need for bringing on more capacity. So that's kind of how we're viewing things near term. Tim, let me just address the question on the maintenance CapEx, first of all. Yes, we are anticipating elevated maintenance CapEx for 2021. And what's really driving that inside the data center business is we're replacing a chiller facility in Boston that has hit the end of life. And so we're replacing and then enhancing that to handle the entire facility there, which should drive us some very good savings as we bring that on. And that will all occur here in the first half of 2021. Secondly, I just want to point out, there is some additional recurring CapEx that we've anticipated in our office business. Not something we talk about often here at CoreSite, but we have signed an office lease at SV1 in Downtown San Jose, which we are going to spend some dollars to bring that space up to what's needed before that tenant commences its lease here in the first half of 2021 as well. Steve? Ari, I think as you look at several of the years, since we basically come public in 2010, I mean, you saw churn ranging from, I think, one year, we were down at 5.5% and then, obviously, this year would have been high at 11.6%. But when you look at and take away some of the highs and lows, on average, we were somewhere right around 7.5% to 8% on a regular basis. And so that's the way I'd probably think of it, somewhere around 1% to 2% per quarter is really what we would classify as fairly typical for us. As you think about 2021, to give you some sense for where we see that, I would anticipate our churn being somewhere between 1% and 1.5% in each of the first and second quarters, and then it would be a little bit elevated in the back half, probably 2% to 2.5% in the back half of the year, as we have the one customer moving out and some in September and some in October. Just to give you some sense for how we think the year will shape up for 2021. Every year we go through a process of looking at the information we disclose and how it's being received and how it's being utilized. And we're always looking for ways to enhance the message by giving good and many times more transparency in certain situations like this one. We felt summarizing the information just felt and gave, and tried to simplify the message. We did the same thing in our debt disclosure table. But the debt, you can go to our 10-K and get all the nitty gritty details that you need. And as Steve pointed out, adding some additional disclosures around how we're managing the business from a sales perspective, we think helps with transparency and aligns it much better. So we're always looking for ways to improve upon it. Specific to your question, trying to simplify it, David. And if there's something in there that's meaningful and is causing some real issues, let me know what it is, and we'll see if we can help you out. Michael, in terms of 2021 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our overall volume increases in 2020 were 7.7%. We actually expect volume increases for 2021 to be around 7%, which is right in line with where our revenue growth is guided to at this point in time. So what we're not certain of and haven't baked into the guidance is how much incremental revenue growth we would receive from customers as they're rolling over on their new lease terms or any migration to those higher priced products. We saw a lot of that activity in 2020 and at this point, have expected that to be fairly muted for 2021. And we'll just see how that rolls out as we go through the year. Well, I would simply say we continue to target that AFFO payout ratio of somewhere around 90%, 92%. And you can see we're just a little bit higher than that currently over the last trailing 12 months. But I don't anticipate that payout ratio increasing, that's the level we're comfortable with at this point in time. And so dividend increases are going to be very highly correlated to cash flow growth. So I would say look closely at the AFFO growth and that's really going to give you a better indication on what that dividend growth is going to look like longer term."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nIgor Khislavsky: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Before the rest of my comments, I'll note that due to COVID-19, all of us on the call this morning are again dialing in remotely from different locations. So to the extent if there are any minor technical difficulties, we would ask that you bear with us. Our agenda for this morning will be as follows: first, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the third quarter. Next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our platform expense initiatives and how we are positioned to benefit from continued wireless technology evolution; and finally, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our third quarter results and updated 2020 outlook. After these comments, we will take your questions. I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include: our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2020 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter. During the quarter, our property revenue increased 3.4% to nearly $2 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.6% to approximately $1.3 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 14.7% and 14.5%, respectively, to $1.02 billion and $2.29. On an FX-neutral basis, growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 8.1%, 9.7%, and 19.5%, respectively. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by roughly 7% to $464 million, or $1.04 per diluted common share. The decrease included the impacts of an FX loss of about $49 million in the quarter and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of roughly $37 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thank you, Igor. Good morning everyone. Consistent with our past practice from our third quarter reports, my remarks today will center largely around the evolution of mobile technology and how we are positioning American Tower to benefit, specifically how we aim to extend our core neutral-host exclusive real estate portfolio to a digital multi-product, multi-service platform offering incremental value to existing and new customers. I'll also go into a bit more depth around two specific platform expansion initiatives, one in the United States and one outside of our core U.S. market. But before I elaborate on that topic, I wanted to briefly cover a few key points on the comprehensive master lease agreement, or MLA, that we signed with T-Mobile in mid-September. This agreement, which lasts through early 2035 augments our strategic relationship with T-Mobile, positions us to capture a significant new business with them over an extended period of time, and preserves the potential for incremental upside for us, particularly later on in the contract term. The MLA maintains the typical annual base escalator that we will recognize on the entire portfolio of included leases over the nearly 15-year term. This escalator is consistent with our historical 3% to 3.5% average rate included in our other U.S. based customer lease agreements. In addition to the base escalator, as is typical with our other comprehensive MLA agreements, there's an annual use fee or bonus escalator component. This additional annual use fee calculated as a percentage of the prior year's lease run rate is in force over the entire term of the agreement, and it allows T-Mobile to add equipment on certain sites up to pre-agreed loading levels. As a result of this use fee, we lock in contractually guaranteed revenue growth over and above the base escalator while T-Mobile will be able to more efficiently deploy their network, a win for both parties. In total, between their contracted backlog we already had in place before the deal, the approximately $17 billion in incremental contractual backlog from the agreement and a 10% or so of our T-Mobile revenues that sit outside of the MLA, we expect to generate at least $23 billion in total revenue from T-Mobile through the contract term and bring our total consolidated contractually committed revenue to more than $58 billion as of the end of Q3. This backlog incorporates the impact of cancellations included within the agreement, which in total is expected to represent around 4% of our consolidated property revenue at the time they occur. Included in these contractual terminations are principally the legacy Sprint revenues that we extended for 10 years back in 2011. As you may recall through that contract, we were able to delay the significant [indiscernible] that our peers experienced for more than five years. Having realized the NPV benefits from that, we will now see some of that deferred to commissioning flow through our run rate over a multi-year period. Once that is complete, we would expect to incur minimal levels of cancellations from T-Mobile over the remaining life of this agreement. Taken as a whole, we believe that our expanded relationship with T-Mobile will be important as we seek to generate double digit annual growth in the combination of our consolidated AFFO per share and dividend yield over the next decade. These types of comprehensive agreements have been incredibly valuable and strategic for us as we are better able to service our customers and consequently become more strategic to them as they densify their networks and deploy new spectrum. As a result, our cash flow generation becomes even more predictable providing us a solid foundation for continued investment in our business and generating further shareholder value. With that said, let me now turn our attention back to discussing how we are positioning American Tower to further benefit from the evolution of mobile technology. Our core global macro tower business has been and will continue to be the foundation of our success, and the primary driver of future cash flows. In fact, our conviction around macro towers being the primary infrastructure for 5G deployments has only increased. As more and more mid-band spectrum is deployed to support 5G, and this network usage continues to grow at upwards of 30% per year and even faster internationally, we believe that significant additional macro tower oriented network densification is inevitable. Recall that today we believe our consolidated customer base is spending upwards of $60 billion per year on building out their network. Going forward, there will be the need for even more equipment on more of our sites as carriers deploy massive MIMO and utilize DSS O-RAN, and then any other tools they have at their disposal to optimize their network performance and efficiency. In addition, as 5G and the surrounding ecosystem develops in the U.S. and this network technology continues to advance throughout our international footprint, we expect to have compelling opportunities to extend our core value proposition into new, related, accretive product and service offerings to expand our total addressable market. One of the key trends driving these opportunities is the continued convergence of wireless and wireline networks. We believe that this convergence along with increasing digitalization, network virtualization, and the agility of cloud native software-defined services will lead to increasing demand for distributed, interconnected, global-edge compute processing. As a result, the first mile of cloud OnRamp as this edge should become a more critical component of our customers' network architecture, and notably this edge is exactly where our exclusive communications real estate assets are located. To capitalize on the opportunities this network evolution is likely to present, we are focused on developing communications infrastructure business model that augment the value of our existing assets, expand our revenue base beyond traditional tenants, and enhance our leadership role in the wireless ecosystem. At the highest level, our goal is to selectively extend our digital infrastructure core capabilities to further encapsulate neutral hosted wireless connectivity, transport and compute functions as part of our comprehensive ATC platform. We can then offer tenants an integrated suite of complementary solutions to fit well within their ever more complex network designs. Within this framework, we intend to remain disciplined in terms of how we deploy capital and believe ventures with select partners could be the most efficient way to develop this platform extension. We expect our investments to focus on business models with several key elements: first, contracted long-term revenue commitments from Tier 1 customers; second, increasing ROIC with multi-tenancy, and multi-service offerings requiring modest ongoing maintenance CapEx; third, operating leverage characteristics similar to towers, we focus on our fixed costs; and fourth synergies and adjacencies with existing ATC assets and skill sets. So with that General backdrop in mind, let me dive deeper into a few specific areas where we are currently focusing our efforts with one example in the United States, and one offshore. In the United States, as 5G deployments accelerate, we expect the proliferation of lower latency applications, and incremental cloud-based customer demand for application level and network compute functions at the edge. There are two distinct solutions within this emerging ecosystem that we are paying attention to: distributed compute, and mobile edge compute. We believe that these two offerings will develop at different timelines and will allow us to provide differentiated value propositions for our customers. On the distributed compute side, enterprise workloads continue to move to the public cloud and a growing near-term market segment is the use of on or off-prem private cloud computing is a hybrid solution. Small and medium-sized businesses are often willing to move legacy workloads to more responsive, proximate, cost-effective data centers, and we believe that many data centers at some of our macro towers can represent optimal locations for these installations. We have started to deploy micro data center facilities at select tower sites, and have seen early indications of solid demand in collaboration with partners like Flexential. In the near-term, this solution enables us to develop operational excellence around the technology and iron out the kinks on a small scale. With that said, we don't necessarily think this use case alone will be the long-term driver of significant value for us. We expect true 5G mobile edge compute solutions to represent a much larger long-term opportunity. The foundational concept of our mobile edge strategy is the expectation that localized neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud micro data centers can be the most cost and technology efficient means to which latency can be reduced to the edge. And that these facilities can be optimally located at select macro tower sites that already have power, fiber, and multiple wireless tenants, rather than each cloud provider and carrier forging ahead with their own connectivity arrangements, our vision is to serve as the neutral host for these low latency relationships, which would drive cost efficiency, improve enter MNO application performance, and accelerate deployment of these facilities throughout the network. We expect this to be a multi-year rearchitecture process, and we are in the early stages of leveraging the knowledge that we've developed through Colo Atl in the small scale deployments at the tower sites I mentioned earlier, to determine the specifics of our go-forward strategy. They also mentioned these offerings in all likelihood will involve partnerships and joint ventures, as we continue to explore where in the value chain we can drive the most incremental upside. At this point, we think a scaled solution is still at least a few years away, but there is tangible progress being made and we are excited about the possibilities. Underlying this excitement of the potential future 5G related use cases that we expect to drive rapid uptake of mobile edge compute functions. Immersive AR and VR gaming applications are obvious examples. Autonomous Vehicle connectivity is another, including our involvement in C-V2X with partners like Qualcomm, and Audi. Next-generation drone delivery networks, real-time sensor-based data collection and analytics, and a host of other enterprise-oriented solutions are also on the way and will require significant levels of compute power on the network edge. Our objective today is to position American Tower to be ready to act decisively when the time is right to be a meaningful player in the space. Meanwhile on the international side, most of our markets are at least five years behind the U.S., in terms of deployed network technology. As a result, the edge compute opportunity and other potential 5G enabled business models are further down the road. The strategic advantage that we expect to have in these areas similar to what we did with our core tower business is the ability to prove out these models in the United States first, and then export them internationally when the time is right. Over time, we believe that our global interconnected reach will be critical in the context of an ever more global, multinational customer base, and their need to support their customer's global needs. In the meantime, one of the main focus areas of our platform extension efforts today throughout Africa and India especially, is on developing power as a service, to drive operational efficiency and cost savings, while materially reducing the carbon footprint of the wireless industry. Throughout much of Africa and India, the electric grid is inherently unreliable. It is part of our service offerings we are responsible for providing onsite power for our tenants. In the past, this was almost exclusively delivered through diesel generators with significant daily run times and diesel usage at considerable expense. More recently, as solar and lithium-ion battery technologies improve or becoming more cost-effective, we have accelerated our adoption of these technologies to make power provision in our sites more efficient, and environmentally friendly. In fact, as of the end of 2019, we had 12.3 megawatts of solar capacity already online with more than 4,500 sites utilizing lithium-ion batteries. To date, we've invested nearly $135 million on fuel and power optimization solutions, and expect to continue to make these investments as we improve site reliability levels for our tenants. As we disclosed in our latest sustainability report, our long-term target is to reduce our scope on fossil fuel consumption in diesel related greenhouse gas emissions in Africa and India by more than 60%, or 140 million liters of diesel annually by 2027. Already, we have made significant progress towards that objective having reduced annual diesel consumption by 65 million liters since 2017, after normalizing for site count growth. To give you a sense for what that translates to, it's essentially the equivalent of taking more than 35,000 cars off the road for a full year or preserving more than 65,000 acres of forest. In addition, we are currently exploring the development of science-based emissions targets consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. These initiatives are in their early stages. We are excited about the impact that we can make going forward. Just like in the United States where we are seeking to leverage our expanding platform to augment the value of our communication sites, we believe that we can translate our expertise and industry leadership in fuel and power internationally into tremendous added value. Reducing the total cost of ownership for our tenants further improving up times and developing more efficient, clean, renewable networks will benefit stakeholders across the value chain. We're committed to making substantial additional progress over the long-term. Just like in the United States where we are working on a number of other initiatives, we're continuing to look at things like fiber to the tower, fiber to the home, and other transport models in many of our international markets as ways to further broaden our addressable market and add value. These value propositions would all be predicated on long-term contractual commitments with multi-tenant and multi-service elements that mirror our existing tower model. In closing, on a global basis, we are in a time of tremendous technological digital transformation. Access to ubiquitous broadband connectivity has never been more important, particularly, in the context of the ongoing pandemic. There are new use cases emerging every day with modern wireless networks becoming more and more dynamic, responsive and critical. As providers of the underlying infrastructure that supports mobile connectivity for billions of people around the world, we have a unique advantage point from which to observe all of these developments. And I think we also have an incredible opportunity to pair our advantages and scale, financial resources, and global reach with our platform expansion initiatives to drive tremendous incremental value for our stakeholders over time in a sustainable way. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod, to go through our third quarter results, and updated full-year 2020 outlook. \nRod Smith: Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining our call, and I hope you're well and remain safe during these challenging times. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong third quarter that outpaced our expectations, and as a result, are raising our full year outlook for key metrics. Before we dive into the details of our results and updated expectations, I'd like to highlight the following. First, demand for our global tower assets was strong in the quarter, most notably and as Tom just discussed, we signed a comprehensive nearly 15-year long master lease agreement with T-Mobile in the U.S. which brought our contracted base of committed future revenue across the company to over $58 billion. We believe that this MLA serves as another reaffirmation of macro towers serving as the baseline of modern wireless networks for the foreseeable future. We also expanded our tower portfolio through select acquisitions and build to suit initiatives, acquiring more than 300 sites in building nearly 1,500, which was a quarterly record. We continue to effectively manage through the challenges posed by COVID with a continued focus on the safety of our employees, vendors, customers and communities. Additionally, our focus on operational excellence, efficiency, and cost controls enabled us to drive expanding margins across the business, despite some of the challenges resulting from the global pandemic. Moving to the balance sheet, we issued around $2.8 billion in U.S. dollar in euro-denominated senior notes across several tenders, including 30 years during the quarter. As a result of these refinancing initiatives, we were able to further extend our repayment schedule, and reduce our weighted average cost of borrowings. We ended the quarter with nearly $6.7 billion in liquidity and increased our euro-denominated borrowings to represent over 10% of our total debt. Finally, we declared a common stock dividend of $1.14 per share, extending our long track record of solid dividend growth. Returning capital to shareholders through the dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation strategy. Now, please turn to Slide 6, and I will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. In addition to discussing growth rates on a reported basis, I'll also outline FX neutral metrics. Our third quarter consolidated property revenue of nearly $2 billion grew on a reported basis by $66 million, or 3.4% over the prior-year period and on an FX neutral basis by $155 million, or 8.1%. Our U.S. property revenue totaled more than $1.1 billion and grew by $27 million, or 2.4% over the prior year, including a roughly 2% negative impact from lower straight-line revenue. Approximately 55% of our consolidated property revenue was generated in the U.S. Our international property revenue was approximately $865 million and grew on a reported basis by around $39 million, or 4.8%. This included FX headwinds of roughly $89 million as compared to Q3 of last year. And on an FX-neutral basis, International Property revenue grew by $129 million, or 15.6%. FX trends have appeared to stabilize over the last several months, and FX was slightly better in Q3 than our prior expectations. Our underlying revenue growth rates reflect solid demand for our tower space from our base of primarily large multinational tenants, who are expected to invest approximately $30 billion in their networks this year, as they continue to add coverage, increased network capacity and rollout more advanced network technology. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see that we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.4% for the quarter, right in line with our expectations. This included U.S. organic tenant billings growth of 4.2% comprised of new business activity, which contributed 2.9%. Escalators, which contributed 3.1%, churn of 1.4%, and a roughly 0.3% negative impact from other items. As expected this growth rate reflects a sequential deceleration driven by modest levels of new business activity from T-Mobile over the last year, but continued strong contributions from other tenants. On a gross basis, including the impacts of our new MLA with T-Mobile, we expect activity to increase beginning in early 2021. Although this will be accompanied by higher levels of churn over the next few years as T-Mobile decommissioned certain Sprint sites. Our international organic tenant billings growth in the quarter was 4.7% led by Africa at over 8%, and Latin America at 7%. Europe was just over 2%, while India was negative 0.5% all of which were in line with our expectations. Gross new business commencements were solid once again as network expansion and densification initiatives continued. The component parts of our international organic tenant billings growth were new business activity, which totaled over 6%. Our mostly local inflation based pricing escalators, which contributed 3.5%, and other items which contributed 20 basis points, partially offset by the churn of 5.2% concentrated in India. Moving on to Slide 7, you can see that our third-quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion grew on a reported basis by about $69 million, or 5.6% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by $119 million, or 9.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 64.5%, up roughly 160 basis points over the prior year, and 120 basis points sequentially. This increase was attributable primarily to solid organic growth throughout the business, as well as diligent cost management and efficiency initiatives. Our U.S. business again drove a substantial majority of our consolidated property segment operating profit accounting for roughly two thirds of the total. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $1.020 billion grew on a reported basis by nearly $131 million or 14.7% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by around $175 million for nearly 20%. Consolidated AFFO per share of $2.29 grew on a reported basis by about $0.29 or 14.5% over last year's levels and on an FX neutral basis grew by $0.39, or almost 20%. This growth in AFFO and AFFO per share was driven by our previously discussed growth in cash adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower cash interest costs resulting from financing activity along with lower levels of cash taxes and maintenance capital spending. Let's now move on to the high-level themes driving our updated 2020 expectations, which reflect increases across all key metrics. Our revised full-year outlook is based on underlying demand expectations that are broadly consistent with our prior view. The large multinational carriers that account for the vast majority of our consolidated property revenue continue to deploy network capital as their customers consume more and more mobile data, irrespective of some of the disruptions caused by COVID-19. In the U.S., we expect leasing demand to pick up as we head into 2021, as carriers ramp investments in 5G and continue 4G upgrades. Mobile data consumption grows at 30% or more per year, and mid-band spectrum deployments accelerate. In the intermediate-term, we think that much of this acceleration is likely to revolve around the deployment of 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Looking slightly further out, we expect that the C band DISH's spectrum assets and to some extent CBRS are likely to all be relevant drivers of network activity. As a result, we believe that the U.S. wireless landscape remains constructive and is poised to drive solid tower leasing activity for many years to come. Our international businesses are performing well and continue to meet our expectations, highlighting the resiliency and critical nature of tower assets across the globe. We also continue to augment our international portfolio through both accretive M&A, and high return new build programs. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for new builds to 5,500 at the midpoint on the back of a record third-quarter where we constructed nearly 1,500 sites. And on the M&A front, we added nearly 300 sites across our international footprint in Q3, bringing our year-to-date total to about 800, including more than 300 in Europe. Broadband connectivity across our international footprint has never been more critical, particularly, in markets with limited fixed-line access and we are working closely with our tenants to help them drive it. As part of these efforts, we have augmented several customer relationships recently, which we believe positioned us well to drive attractive growth while delivering high levels of service. We are already seeing benefits of these enhanced partnerships through accelerating organic growth in markets like Nigeria, and higher levels of new build activity in many of our other markets and expect these positive trends to continue over the long-term. Meanwhile, in India, the Supreme Court has ruled on a 10-year AGR repayment timeline for the carriers. We view this as a positive as it provides incremental clarity in the marketplace in near-term breathing room for the carriers in terms of their liquidity. While we believe it is too early for these positive developments to translate into significant improvements in our near-term operating results, they do provide a base for optimism for the longer term. As it relates to our 2020 outlook, outside of some more favorable projections for a bad debt due to better collections over the last few months, our operational expectations in India are essentially unchanged from our prior view. Now, please turn to Slide 8, and we will review our raised outlook midpoints. Our updated guidance for property revenue is $7.89 billion, which is an increase of $165 million, compared to our prior outlook and reflects a growth rate on a reported basis of 5.6%. On an FX neutral basis, the growth rate would be right around 10%. For the U.S. property segment, we now expect revenues of nearly $4.5 billion, which is $115 million above our prior projection. This is primarily being driven by about $105 million in incremental straight-line revenue attributable to our new T-Mobile MLA, as well as some other non-run rate outperformance in the business. For our International property segment, we now anticipate property revenue of $3.390 billion, which is $50 million higher than our prior projections. This is being driven by approximately $15 million in favorable FX impacts along with around $13 million in additional currency neutral pastures, and roughly $7 million in incremental straight-line revenue as well as $15 million or so in other outperformance throughout the business. Moving to the right side of the slide, we are reiterating our expectations for 4.5% to 5% consolidated organic tenant billings growth. This includes a projection of 4.5% for the U.S. and roughly 5% for international. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect an acceleration in gross new business activity in the U.S. beginning in early 2021, in part driven by our new agreement with T-Mobile. Turning to Slide 9, you can see that we now expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $5.1 billion, which is $170 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook and over11% greater than the prior year on an FX neutral basis. The primary drivers of this increase are approximately $105 million in an incremental net straight line, about $27 million and better than expected non-pass through, primarily non-run rate cash revenues around $28 million, and lower than expected non-pass through direct operating costs in cash SG&A, including $20 million and lower bad debt expectations in India in favorable FX impacts of roughly $5 million. For the year, we now expect cash SG&A as a percent of consolidated property revenue to be 8.2%, or around 7.2%, excluding bad debt reflecting continued scale benefits across the business. Lastly, we expect consolidated AFFO for the full year to be $3.75 billion at the midpoint, which is $75 million, or 2% above our prior outlook. On an FX-neutral basis, this reflects the growth of nearly 11% even including the $63 million one-time cash interest expense impact from our purchase of MTNs joint venture stakes in Africa earlier this year. The primary drivers of the increase as compared to our prior expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA outperformance I just mentioned, $20 million in lower net cash interest, and about $5 million in favorable FX impacts, partially offset by $10 million in additional expected maintenance capital spending. On a per share basis, we now expect to generate consolidated AFFO of $8.40, an increase of $0.17 as compared to the prior outlook. On an FX neutral basis, the year-on-year per share growth rate would be nearly 11%. Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our capital deployment expectations for the full year. Let me start by stating that we remain committed to our existing disciplined approach to capital allocation, which for many years has proven to be successful. This deep-rooted philosophy guides our decisions regarding dividends, capital expenditures, M&A and stock repurchases. For 2020, we expect our full-year dividend subject to board approval to be approximately $2 billion resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20%. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we expect the dividend growth rates in future years will likely be below 20% in line with our expected re-taxable income growth rates, again subject to the discretion of our board. Regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to deploy about $1.15 billion with more than 85% allocated towards discretionary projects. This is up to $75 million from our prior outlook, driven primarily by higher expected new build activity, as well as some acceleration in start-up capital spending and a small increase in maintenance CapEx. On the M&A front, we have spent roughly $860 million so far this year, including our previously mentioned purchase of the JV stake in Africa in the first quarter, and we are actively evaluating additional opportunities. Our previously announced purchase of the Tata's remaining stake in our India business is still pending regulatory approval in India. At quarter-end and exchange rates, this represents a purchase price of approximately $336 million, and for the purposes of outlook, we have assumed that this transaction will be finalized by the end of the year. And lastly, our year-to-date dividend declarations plus the $56 million we have deployed for stock repurchases, we have now returned about $1.5 billion to common stockholders so far in 2020. Turning now to Slide 11, I will briefly touch on our strong investment-grade balance sheet, which we believe will be a critical component of our continued growth. Since becoming an investment grade in late 2009, our balance sheet strength has allowed us to grow revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and consolidated AFFO per share, while maintaining prudent levels of liquidity and ensuring unobstructed access to capital at attractive rates. During the quarter, we accessed capital markets in the U.S. and Europe to issue roughly $2.8 billion across multiple tenures, including 30-years in both the U.S. dollar and euros. As of the end of the quarter, our average cost of debt stood at 2.9% more than 200 basis points below 2010 levels and average debt tenor was more than seven years, nearly two years in excess of where we were back in 2010. Our available liquidity totaled $6.7 billion, and our net leverage was 4.5 times, solidly within the three to five times target range. Taking all this balance sheet momentum into account, we believe that we are in a tremendous position of financial strength. Looking forward, we remain committed to our existing financial policies as we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, low cost of debt appropriate and consistent levels of leverage along with disciplined capital allocation decisions are essential to our ability to deliver attractive total shareholder returns over an extended period of time. On Slide 12 and in summary, we are positioned to finish the year strong with improving margins, enhanced strategic relationships with our tenants and continued opportunities to deploy capital towards accretive growth. Looking ahead, 5G deployment activity in the U.S. is poised to accelerate beginning in 2021, and we believe this will include material deployments of the mid-band spectrum, primarily in suburban and rural areas of the country where our towers are located. In addition, DISH is expected to begin building a nationwide network towards the back half of next year, driving potential future upside. Given our comprehensive portfolio of U.S. assets and mutually beneficial relationships with our tenants, we believe that we are well-positioned to drive a prolonged period of attractive contractually guaranteed U.S. growth. Meanwhile, we expect our diverse International Property segment to continue to perform well as global mobile network operator's deployed significant capital to deliver capable high-quality networks for their customers who are consuming more and more mobile data than ever before. Our international footprint of more than 140,000 sites is an excellent complement to our foundational U.S. asset base, and we expect that over the long term it will help us elongate and augment our growth trajectory. Finally, we believe that as a result of our strong balance sheet, our disciplined and steady approach to capital allocation, and most importantly because of our 5,500 experienced and talented employees across the globe, we are well-positioned to continue our long track record of driving consistent reoccurring consolidated AFFO per share growth, and growing dividend and attractive total shareholder returns. With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a first question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please, go ahead. Wait. One moment here. My apologies Mr. Rollins. Please, go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Well, thanks, and good morning. Two questions if I could. The first is, you were describing that gross new activity in the U.S. business should improve in early 2021. Is there a risk that carriers slow activity, while they await the results of the C-Band auction? Can you provide us with a framework or historical perspective on how to think about how much leasing activity can improve from the current run rate? And then just secondly, if you could help unpack the timing of churn related to the comprehensive deal that you signed with T-Mobile? Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Hey Michael, maybe I'll start and then, Rod can come in. What we'll come out with specific guidance, obviously in February of next year when we release earnings. But what we are seeing is, as we said on the last call, we expect that a pickup in activity from T-Mobile. So there is going to be one of the principal drivers of the pickup particularly early on in 2021. As we see the level of activity picking up in the latter half of 2020. So there are going to be one of the principal, I think drivers of that pickup. And with regards to kind of the C-Band question what we've seen historically, you've seen this as clearly as well being so close to us and to what the carriers are doing. They're going to be taking advantage and leveraging every last megahertz they have of the spectrum. And so I think that they're not going to wait specifically for the new spectrum to be deployed there. That's going to fit right into their strategy at C-Band deployment schedule is going to be over a multi-year. And so they're going to continue to build out their current 5G if you will, along the same kind of layered cake kind of spectrum capacity that we've talked about in the past. So we would expect that the carriers are going to continue to spend, continue to meet their own customers' needs, and they're doing it differently. As you well know, they're doing it across many different bands. But they're going to continue to deploy. So as I said, we'll provide more detail on that deployment in our Q4 call. But we're obviously, very bullish in terms of how we would see 2021. And Rod, you have anything to add.\nRod Smith: Yes. I'll add a couple of things. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. So the pickup that we are seeing going forward really is centered on T-Mobile as Tom alluded to. So, everybody knows that there was a slowdown from T-Mobile that began late in 2019 as they prepared for their merger with Sprint that persisted through most of 2020 to date. So that \u2013 now that we're lapping that, we've got a base of growth to grow from and that was the new T-Mobile deal, we have contracted levels of business going into 2021. So we do see an acceleration there. The other carriers have been pretty consistent through 2020, so that's been good to see this year so far. And then related to the churning part of your question, we do see that churn for T-Mobile happening over a multi-year period. It really will begin in late 2021, and go out for a few years, about four years. And we'll talk more about that Michael when we give guidance in February.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks for the additional detail.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to a question from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please, go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks, good morning. I hope you guys are doing well.\nRod Smith: Good Morning, Ric.\nRic Prentiss: A couple of questions. Hey Rod. A couple of questions, I apologize I got pulled off for a second there to give my name and firm when you were getting your prepared remarks. T-Mobile when they were talking about the new MLA said that the escalators could de-escalate over time. Tom, you mentioned before I got cut-off that escalators are in the kind of consistent with the 3%, 3.5% range. But how should we think about escalators plus usage and then churn affecting that kind of a multi-year basis. Do the numbers go up every year or percent going down? How should we think about that comment from T-Mobile say escalators are going to de-escalate?\nTom Bartlett: Well, I think as I mentioned before Ric. There are two escalators that are part of this agreement. As is typical with similar types of the agreement, we have the base escalator which we have in all as you well know in all of our agreements \u2013 master agreements which are in the 3% to 3.5% range. And that will stay fixed for the entire term of the contract. On top of that is our \u2013 what we call is our use fee or our second escalator that's on top of the base escalator. And that escalator allows then \u2013 and that on an annual basis, and it's and it's determined based upon the prior year, monthly or the ending year run rates. And that then allows T-Mobile to add equipment up to preloading agreements, up to certain rights on the agreement themselves. And that escalator is also in force over the lane of the contract. Now that second escalator unlike the first does decrease over time really as a result of the base getting bigger. So it's a slightly lower escalator that it's applied to a higher base to drive consistent rate of incremental growth. And so the comment was that I believe that it does de-escalate. And on that second escalator the way we think about that, that is in fact true. But it's really as I said, a function of that the base is getting bigger. And so you have a slightly lower use fee escalator being applied to it to keep a consistent rate of incremental growth, again, as part of the comprehensive or holistic agreement over the entire term of the agreement. So that I think, I'm trying to tie to connect the dots and tie it together. That's fundamentally how that agreement, both escalators will work.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And I know you're going to give 2021 guidance on the February call. But should we think about given all the complexity here. Maybe you guys might consider giving multi-year guidance in the future?\nTom Bartlett: That's something that we are thinking about. I mean I've been spending time with Rod and Igor. So that's very, very possible Ric, just to give people a sense of what it might look like on a multi-year period given the churn that we are expecting in as a result of the, kind of the Sprint leases coming off. But that's very possible.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And lastly from me, you mentioned -Rod mentioned Dish maybe back half of 2021 ramping up. Are you guys MLA discussions with them. Should we expect an MLA with Dish and could there be maybe C-Band effort earlier and then you suggested if people are aggressive with their other carriers?\nTom Bartlett: We know, on the Dish question, I don't want to get into any specifics with them or as you would expect, we're in significant conversations with them, as we're always talking to customers. They've stated that they are looking to start to build out their network. I believe in the second half of the year, and so we want to make sure that we're there for them enable to service them to the extent that we can. So there are, candidly, a lot of conversation going on there. As I said that we'd like we have with all our customers. On the C-Band that's possible in anticipation of that spectrum being deployed, carriers getting ready to be able to participate in that. That's always an opportunity we believe. I'm not sure how material that would be, candidly, Ric at this point in time, it's hard to tell. The likes of Verizon, AT&T, I mean they deploy capital in a very regimented kind of measured way. And so it's hard to say that would materially change the timing or direction of growth rates. But it's very possible that there might be some acceleration of some growth as a result of that band in particular becoming available.\nRic Prentiss: And I meant \u2013 sorry, I meant to also ask, are you seeing anything from cable operators who have started buying some spectrum and are registered for some auctions? Any activity from the cable interested in new towers?\nTom Bartlett: We've \u2013 and by the way we have cable customers today. Again, I don't want to get any specifics there Ric, particularly as it relates to new entrants into the market. But we're obviously, I think well positioned to be able to service them to the extent that they go down that path.\nRic Prentiss: Appreciate it. Hope you, family and employees stay well in these crazy times. Good luck, guys.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. You too, Ric. Be well.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Ric.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a few on international. I guess more broadly are you seeing any cause or slowing in the pacing of activity across your larger markets whether you like the macro or COVID-related pressure, sort of hampering carrier spending plans? And then just drilling down in terms of India, Colo and amendment activity looks like it's moderated now for three straight quarters. So I'm just wondering what's the latest you're seeing there, and how should we think about the pacing of net organic growth from here? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Hey Matt. Hey, thanks. Thanks for the question. I think on the contrary on international markets. I continually see incredible densification initiatives and new newbuild projects going on in just about all of the markets whether it's Mexico, Brazil, down in Latin America, Africa. We're seeing significant increases in demand for build to suit new co-locations orders. So I can go by market and I can see significant levels of increase in Colo orders as well as build to suit. As Rod said, I would continue to set records on build to suit activities. So I think that's just indicative of the amount of densification that's going on around the globe. With particularly in India, in India again, we hit on a gross basis kind of double-digit growth rates. And so what we see continued demand there. I think there has been a general slowdown overall, not just regards to COVID, but I think also with regard to clearing through a lot of the AGR, a lot of tax issues, I think that put a slowdown if you will. Some of the levels of the spend that the carriers were doing in the marketplace. But hopefully, much of that will be behind us and the carriers I now \u2013 I know are really starting to think about and move forward in terms of looking to increase kind of rates of growth going forward. COVID has impacted some of the build to suit activity in the marketplace in terms of getting permits and some of those types of things. And as you well know, I mean India has really struggled as much of the world. But in particular, India has struggled with COVID, particularly over the last several months. So I know that has actually slowed down some of the build to suit activity. But on the growth side, the market is very strong.\nRod Smith: And Tom, if I could just add a couple of points there. So on the organic tenant billings growth, we did have a basically a flat organic tenant billings growth for the quarter in India. But we had about 2.3% added through the newbuild program that Tom just mentioned. So we built just shy of a thousand towers in India in the quarter. And I'll just remind everyone that in India, our day one returns on those new bills are solidly in the double digits. So even close to 14 %.\nMatt Niknam: Thanks, guys.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please, go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. So one international and one U.S. I guess on the U.S., given again all the moving parts around CBRS, and C-Band, and Dish, and the T-Mobile churn that Rod talked about. Can you frame the U.S. organic growth rate next year? Just sort of directionally higher or lower than what you were forecasting for this year based on \u2013 based on what you're seeing right now. And then internationally, apart from India where it sounds like you made a little bit of a different assumption with respect to bad debt there was some churn \u2013 there's some gross leasing a lot to unpack there. But what are the biggest variables to think about as we think about 2021 either by country or within India? If India is that country that would need to kind of the most variability in the outlook? I would appreciate your perspective. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Hey, thanks, Jon. We'll get in the specifics for 2021 and on our next quarter's call. I think as we've alluded to it, we've talked that we would expect an increase in the gross in the U.S. business. Michael if that wouldn't be before and I think it's a function of some of the activity that we're seeing happen with T-Mobile. And we're very bullish on what's going on in the U.S. markets. I mean not a lot of different fronts not just in terms of the new spectrum, new technology being deployed, but potential new entrants into the market continued growth in demand. Even though the realization process that the government is driving in terms of trying to ensure that broadband is therefore for all. I mean I think all of these would clearly give us a bullish sense of what we would expect in the U.S. market over the next couple of years. And in particular in 2021, just on top of the ongoing demand that we see going on from a network usage perspective. Internationally, in each of the markets we \u2013 just in terms of guidance for 2020, I mean all of the markets are up from a revenue perspective. As I mentioned before they're significant densification efforts going on in all of the markets. You can always go market-by-market and look at various metrics, and you can \u2013 you can see that there is a significant new infrastructure that needs to be added. New sites that need to be added in those markets to be able to support the growth that they have going on in those markets. And so, as we've always said, and as you well know, the international markets are a couple of technologies behind generally. And so \u2013 and without any really strong wireline capability, and so on \u2013 and a pandemic even the market, the world that we're living in today there's even more of a demand for wireless infrastructure in those markets. And so, I think all of that gives a good backdrop for what we would expect growth to look like in the internationally in those markets. We've always said it's going to be 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than we're seeing in the United States. And if you take a look at even in Q3, you look at Latin America; you look at Africa they're all up in the kind of 7% to 8% range. And so, it's \u2013 the model works. I think the strategy works and we're very bullish in terms of what we're expecting to see in our international markets over the next several years.\nJon Atkin: The 5,500 deals that upsized outlook that you gave us to any kind of a regional pick out that you could provide?\nTom Bartlett: I mean, I think we have. I mean Rod can give the one. I mean India was up a bit. We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there. So there's an outsized, probably piece of that 5,500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria \u2013 markets like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets there we're seeing upticks in the overall build to suit the activity. Brazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today. I think to be able to meet the demand and provide a good quality signal, and so we're seeing increased demand for site builds in Brazil as well. So it's a bit of a mix across the three of them I'd say. And I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to see continued increases in rates that built the suit going forward. It's our best rate of return capital dollars spent in the business. And so, we work very closely with our carriers to be able to kind of maximize that category of CapEx.\nJon Atkin: Thank you, very much.\nRod Smith: And Jonathan, I'll just give you a few numbers here to support Tom's comment. So of the 5,500, India is going to be the lion's share of that probably close to 3,500. In Latin America maybe around 500. In Africa, you can think of that as about 1,300 or so in that range and handful in Europe, maybe 40 in Europe and in a small number in the U.S.\nJon Atkin: Got it. Thanks, so much.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Tim Long with Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Thank you. Just one quick clarification if I could and then a question. I just want to make sure I heard it right as far as not to kill the team of Sprint MLA here. But it is the comment that this is likely going to be a four-year period. I think I heard that? And then second, I'm just interested in talking a little bit about Europe. Obviously, still pretty small but a few hundred, 200 acquired sites there. Could you give a little more color on that, and maybe update us on views there with the MLA landscape is obviously still a lot of activity in the European theatre. And you guys are underrepresented? So just an update there would be great. Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Sure. No, Tim. The churn in the \u2013 as we said multi-year, three to four years that you would expect to see a lot of that churn flush through. So hopefully that will give you a sense of the time period on that. Europe has always been a market. We've been looking at Europe for, and getting deeper into the region for many, many years. And we've always struggled from a valuation perspective and a growth perspective. We think of the U.S. business being the largest driver of cash flow as kind of the developed market and create a consistent rate of growth. And then we've looked at our Europe, our international markets candidly as ways to increase the slope of the curve from a cash flow growth perspective. And so we're willing and have been able to take some higher levels of risk if you will going into international markets using significantly higher risk-adjusted hurdle rates. But really is a function of the core U.S. business. And so when we take a look at Europe as being somewhat \u2013 more of a developed market, the growth rates have just not been particularly strong. I mean the beachfront properties that we have in France, and Germany and now just entered into Poland; the growth rates have been in the 2% to 4% kind of rate of growth. And so when we think about allocating capital that generally hasn't been overly exciting, candidly in terms of the overall rates of growth. And then when we take a look at the underlying valuations for a lot of the assets in the particular markets, we really struggle with some of the growth expectations that you would have to realize to be able to support some of the underlying valuations for those assets. Now, we're \u2013 given the size and kind of the scope of American Tower, we're part of every deal that goes down in the region. And so, we're watching it very closely. We're participating in certain areas. As you said, we're undersized, I guess, relative to some of the \u2013 to Cellnex, for example, in the marketplace. But that's okay. I mean we're \u2013 that doesn't bother me in terms of our presence. We're going to continue to look at a deal by every deal on its own and take a look at the underlying variables of the deal and expectations of the deal and to the extent that the ROI and the NPDs can be sizeable. We'll look to participate in it and see kind of where we land in terms of being successful there. But just because we're relatively under sized versus the other players in the marketplace that doesn't concern me at all. We're all here about creating AFFO per share growth and ROIC growth, and to the extent that they can contribute to those two variables. We're going to weigh in and participate. So, we'll see where that lands over and it will continue to develop. There are a lot of assets, as you said. They're going to be coming up on the marketplace. There are a lot of large carriers, who are looking to monetize their assets. So, there very well could be some opportunities there. And as I said, we'll just take a look at them one at a time.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you very much.\nRod Smith: Hi, Tim. Tim, I think the other part of your question was the breakdown of the sites that we acquired in Q3, so we acquired a little over 300 sites in Q3. 195 of those were in France through our arrangement with Orange, which we've talked about in the past. And then there was an additional block here in Chile and Peru, which are our additional tranches with the \u2013 on the Intel agreement that we have. So that makes up the majority of that that 305. So it's really in France, Chile, and Peru.\nTim Long: Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: And next we go to a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nTom Bartlett: Hi, Dave.\nDavid Barden: Hi, Tom. I wanted to come back to the T-Mobile agreement a little bit, last quarter you guys took T-Mobile out of your second half guidance. Your competitors actually spoke pretty optimistically about what that was going to mean for them. And so, the conclusion was that T-Mobile was steering business away from American Tower in an effort to gain leverage to negotiate a new MLA. And as a result of that, as we look forward to conversations that are going to emerge around the C-Band deployments, brand new networks not going to be deployed everywhere, only need to be deployed somewhere. Is there a thought that other carriers, DISH included, are going to look at what T-Mobile did in terms of how they steered business to some players in a way from others to gain leverage in these negotiations that somehow the balance of power between the towers and the carriers might have changed somehow. Could you kind of comment on how you think that might evolve in kind of the next phase of network development?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, Dave, I mean, I don't think that's the case candidly. I think given the real estate that we have and the sites that we have, we're quite comfortable that the carriers are always going to have to come to us. I mean, that's kind of the beauty of the business that we have and the real estate that we have. I mean, we're always in negotiations with all the carriers. We're trying to meet their needs along the way is any typical kind of lesser or lessee kind of a relationship, but I don't think there's any real credence to the fact that there's leverage that's created as a result of moving or not coming onto our sites. I mean, we have a very long-term view of our business, of our customer base. We think that I think that's indicative of kind of the 15-year agreement that we put in place with T-Mobile. We think that, as we said in the past, that these types of master lease agreements are incredibly strategic and important to us for a number of reasons, not just to driving sizable predictable growth, but we also see really very sizable growth overall as a result of the additional right to use kind of base escalator. Historically, if you look at ATC in the United States, we've garnered, we generated over 50% of the new business in the United States on a fairly consistent basis. And so, I think that's indicative of the types of relationships that we have with our carriers over time. Are there always other issues in terms of some of the negotiations, sure we get some high priced sites, sites that have been out there for a very long period of time that have escalators on them. And we work very closely with the carriers then to try to bring those back to market, but then generating other types of value for us over a long time. So we're in constant \u2013 I'm in constant conversations with our U.S. customers. And so, I don't see that kind of activity. And if it does, as I said, it would be noise and it would not impact the way we think about our business or the way we strike kind of long-term lease agreements with any of our customers.\nDavid Barden: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then Rod, could I ask you just one quick one. You mentioned that part of the guidance in the quarter was related to non-run rate outperformance factors. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what those were and what they contributed?\nRod Smith: Sure, Dave. I think you're referring to the Q3 numbers. So, the non-run rate items, they're primarily in India. We had a few settlements in India about $25 million worth of settlements in India that will not be recurring that were in our Q3 numbers.\nDavid Barden: Got it. Okay. So that was the big delta in the Indian performance, all right. Thank you so much.\nRod Smith: Correct.\nOperator: And our next question is from Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you for the question. So a lot of the questions today have been focused on the model, the 3Q results, the escalators, and it's all been very helpful. But I wanted to just shift gears to the micro data center and to the edge compute commentary that you made earlier on the conference call. And I think the one thing that a lot of market constituents and the analyst community is interested in is what is American Tower's core strategy entering this market? Is it going to be the provider of Colo? Is it going to be the leasing aspect? Is it going to be the go-to-market with Flexential and other providers? Can you just give us more color on what we should expect from AMT over the next couple of years on what your tactical strategy is going to be within the edge ecosystem? That'd be very helpful just to get a good idea on where all the chips are going to fall.\nTom Bartlett: Right. No, no, I appreciate it. Thanks for the question. I tried to cover that in some of my prepared remarks. I mean, it's the highest level. We're really trying to create tower like communications infrastructure business models. They really augment, if you will, the value of our existing assets, expand our revenue base beyond the traditional tenants if you will and expand our role in that whole delivery system. It's all about extending the platform. And clearly part of that platform is that compute capability. And so, we're looking as part of that platform and the compute transport functions and really trying to create ways of being able to incrementally provide service to our customers. And so, if you think about kind of our longer term views of it, we're candidly looking at okay of the 40,000 sites in the United States, which could all be considered edge compute locations. It is at the edge. It is at the very edge of the edge if you will. How many of those sites would fit well in terms of fitting them out to be able to support the number of enterprise accounts, to support hyperscalers, to supplier data centers in ways where we can provide and be really part of that process to provide lower latency types of applications. And at each one of those sites then given kind of the real estate that we have, how many shelters can we put at each one of those locations, how much power can we drop into each one of those shelters and how many comes down to how many cabinets can we load up in each one of those new shelters? And so, we're looking at sites that potentially can hold two or three shelters, each shelter holding 8 to 10 cabs each providing 100 kilowatt of power into each one of those shelters themselves in a way that it can provide them kind of really an on-ramp for accounts in that particular location into the wireless world. And so, the models that we have and the trials that we have right now are trialing exactly that. And looking at then what are the price points for each one of those cabinets, can we get a traditional kind of $1,900 to $2,000 per cab in each one of those locations. How stackable are the shelters going to be? And then \u2013 and really looking at what that demand is. And so, we have several proof-of-concepts that we're working on in tandem with some potential partners and actually are looking at those now in front of certain enterprises to be able to determine really what is the opportunity there. In terms of how far we go along the kind of the value prop scale, that to be determined. Clearly, we have co-location in real estate, so those are kind of given. Then the question is, okay, how far do we go up the stack and then how do we provide those kinds of capabilities? As I mentioned in my remarks, it's not like we're looking to hire 1,000 software engineers or 2,000 sales reps to start selling into enterprise accounts and providing them access to cloud-based services. That's not our skill set. And so we would look to augment our capabilities with other capabilities to be able to jointly provide what we think could be a very interesting value proposition to the enterprise accounts around the country. So, time will tell. However, this is in early stages now. As I said, we're really dedicated. We have a number of resources dedicated to try to understand what this is, what the CapEx requirements are going to be at the site location and really again to come back to driving tower like communications infrastructure business models. So that's it, and kind of a short \u2013 a couple of sound bites. And you'll continually hear more and more about our strategy there as it develops and as we continue to go down the journey.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you. That was actually a lot of detail, just one quick follow-up on that. And this fall mainly has to do with domestic versus international and this micro opportunity. A lot of the focus and the commentary has been focused on domestic deployment of micro data centers, but what about international, right? There are clearly big differences in terms of how the network looks abroad. And do you see edge being a much bigger opportunity abroad versus domestic at least within the next two to three years? Or is it going to be predominantly focused on domestic opportunities for now?\nTom Bartlett: As I mentioned before, traditionally our international markets are a couple of technologies behind where they are in the United States. Having said that though, I think one of the real advantages that we bring to a venture is our global reach and the lack of really processing capability in many of our emerging markets that we have today. And so, while I think the strategy will probably more \u2013 will initially develop in the United States. I think the real value, ultimately, particularly as the \u2013 as the world shrinks. And as the cloud learns \u2013 we'll connect this off and does move to the edge. I think that our global reach is actually a real interesting element to what, as I said, we bring to the party. And so, it's difficult to say how the outside of the United States market might develop. We might find in certain markets that it may develop more quickly and that the kind of the edge compute capability turns into more than just in edge. You may be able to cluster certain edges to provide more of a metro data facility. Again \u2013 and particularly in areas of the world where there really isn't a lot of data center presence. So it will be very interesting question and one we're kind of getting our arms around and understanding exactly what are the benefits as a result of having that global reach? I think candidly that they're significant and we'll try to leverage that as much as we possibly can.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you very much.\nTom Bartlett: You bet.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. A couple of follow ups on the T-Mobile MLA again. I think you adjusted the straight line for this year, $20 million higher than the original guidance. What drove that? And second in terms of, as you look at the T-Mobile deployment, you have a pretty good insight into their long-term network span. Would you be able to provide some color if you think that you took a larger share of T-Mobile's future activity with this long-term contract? And also to the extent that T-Mobile acquires more spectrum or builds more sites, do you \u2013 can you give us some commentary in terms of could there be upsides to this existing MLA or is it mostly captured at least for the next few years?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No, thanks. Let me start and Rod to get in to add any additional color. On the straight line, I mean, it's \u2013 we're just refining the calculations as you might expect. It's a very complicated calculation. And so, it was just a kind of refinement of the calculation as that we were able to do. So there's nothing remarkable, I think, going on with regards to the actual straight line calculation. And with regards to your other question, I mean, all of our contracts are designed to take more than our fair share of the business. And as I mentioned before, historically in the United States we've captured over 50% of the new business in the United States. And so our contracts are designed to do that, but in a way that's providing a meaningful capability and service to our customers. And so with regards to the agreement that we put in T-Mobile, we are absolutely, we believe more strategic to them. We're working side-by-side with them on a number of different initiatives as we typically do when we enter into these types of relationships. Clearly, there is a desire for them to one to put more equipment on our sites as a result of the fact that they're already paying for it. And so, as a result of that, we would think that we would get an outsized part of their business. And so this is no different. And so to the extent that there's acceleration, there are different initiatives that they're looking to undertake, which knowing T-Mobile, we would expect so. We would hope that we would be really in the catbird seat in terms of being able to pick up a lot of that incremental business. And that's, as I said, historically, what these kinds of comprehensive holistic master lease agreements have really positioned us to be able to take advantage of that we hope so.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And Mr. Khislavsky, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nIgor Khislavsky: Great. Thanks, Leah. Thank you everybody for joining this morning and have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining our call, and I hope you're well and remain safe during these challenging times. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong third quarter that outpaced our expectations, and as a result, are raising our full year outlook for key metrics. Before we dive into the details of our results and updated expectations, I'd like to highlight the following. First, demand for our global tower assets was strong in the quarter, most notably and as Tom just discussed, we signed a comprehensive nearly 15-year long master lease agreement with T-Mobile in the U.S. which brought our contracted base of committed future revenue across the company to over $58 billion. We believe that this MLA serves as another reaffirmation of macro towers serving as the baseline of modern wireless networks for the foreseeable future. We also expanded our tower portfolio through select acquisitions and build to suit initiatives, acquiring more than 300 sites in building nearly 1,500, which was a quarterly record. We continue to effectively manage through the challenges posed by COVID with a continued focus on the safety of our employees, vendors, customers and communities. Additionally, our focus on operational excellence, efficiency, and cost controls enabled us to drive expanding margins across the business, despite some of the challenges resulting from the global pandemic. Moving to the balance sheet, we issued around $2.8 billion in U.S. dollar in euro-denominated senior notes across several tenders, including 30 years during the quarter. As a result of these refinancing initiatives, we were able to further extend our repayment schedule, and reduce our weighted average cost of borrowings. We ended the quarter with nearly $6.7 billion in liquidity and increased our euro-denominated borrowings to represent over 10% of our total debt. Finally, we declared a common stock dividend of $1.14 per share, extending our long track record of solid dividend growth. Returning capital to shareholders through the dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation strategy. Now, please turn to Slide 6, and I will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. In addition to discussing growth rates on a reported basis, I'll also outline FX neutral metrics. Our third quarter consolidated property revenue of nearly $2 billion grew on a reported basis by $66 million, or 3.4% over the prior-year period and on an FX neutral basis by $155 million, or 8.1%. Our U.S. property revenue totaled more than $1.1 billion and grew by $27 million, or 2.4% over the prior year, including a roughly 2% negative impact from lower straight-line revenue. Approximately 55% of our consolidated property revenue was generated in the U.S. Our international property revenue was approximately $865 million and grew on a reported basis by around $39 million, or 4.8%. This included FX headwinds of roughly $89 million as compared to Q3 of last year. And on an FX-neutral basis, International Property revenue grew by $129 million, or 15.6%. FX trends have appeared to stabilize over the last several months, and FX was slightly better in Q3 than our prior expectations. Our underlying revenue growth rates reflect solid demand for our tower space from our base of primarily large multinational tenants, who are expected to invest approximately $30 billion in their networks this year, as they continue to add coverage, increased network capacity and rollout more advanced network technology. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see that we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.4% for the quarter, right in line with our expectations. This included U.S. organic tenant billings growth of 4.2% comprised of new business activity, which contributed 2.9%. Escalators, which contributed 3.1%, churn of 1.4%, and a roughly 0.3% negative impact from other items. As expected this growth rate reflects a sequential deceleration driven by modest levels of new business activity from T-Mobile over the last year, but continued strong contributions from other tenants. On a gross basis, including the impacts of our new MLA with T-Mobile, we expect activity to increase beginning in early 2021. Although this will be accompanied by higher levels of churn over the next few years as T-Mobile decommissioned certain Sprint sites. Our international organic tenant billings growth in the quarter was 4.7% led by Africa at over 8%, and Latin America at 7%. Europe was just over 2%, while India was negative 0.5% all of which were in line with our expectations. Gross new business commencements were solid once again as network expansion and densification initiatives continued. The component parts of our international organic tenant billings growth were new business activity, which totaled over 6%. Our mostly local inflation based pricing escalators, which contributed 3.5%, and other items which contributed 20 basis points, partially offset by the churn of 5.2% concentrated in India. Moving on to Slide 7, you can see that our third-quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion grew on a reported basis by about $69 million, or 5.6% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by $119 million, or 9.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 64.5%, up roughly 160 basis points over the prior year, and 120 basis points sequentially. This increase was attributable primarily to solid organic growth throughout the business, as well as diligent cost management and efficiency initiatives. Our U.S. business again drove a substantial majority of our consolidated property segment operating profit accounting for roughly two thirds of the total. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $1.020 billion grew on a reported basis by nearly $131 million or 14.7% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by around $175 million for nearly 20%. Consolidated AFFO per share of $2.29 grew on a reported basis by about $0.29 or 14.5% over last year's levels and on an FX neutral basis grew by $0.39, or almost 20%. This growth in AFFO and AFFO per share was driven by our previously discussed growth in cash adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower cash interest costs resulting from financing activity along with lower levels of cash taxes and maintenance capital spending. Let's now move on to the high-level themes driving our updated 2020 expectations, which reflect increases across all key metrics. Our revised full-year outlook is based on underlying demand expectations that are broadly consistent with our prior view. The large multinational carriers that account for the vast majority of our consolidated property revenue continue to deploy network capital as their customers consume more and more mobile data, irrespective of some of the disruptions caused by COVID-19. In the U.S., we expect leasing demand to pick up as we head into 2021, as carriers ramp investments in 5G and continue 4G upgrades. Mobile data consumption grows at 30% or more per year, and mid-band spectrum deployments accelerate. In the intermediate-term, we think that much of this acceleration is likely to revolve around the deployment of 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Looking slightly further out, we expect that the C band DISH's spectrum assets and to some extent CBRS are likely to all be relevant drivers of network activity. As a result, we believe that the U.S. wireless landscape remains constructive and is poised to drive solid tower leasing activity for many years to come. Our international businesses are performing well and continue to meet our expectations, highlighting the resiliency and critical nature of tower assets across the globe. We also continue to augment our international portfolio through both accretive M&A, and high return new build programs. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for new builds to 5,500 at the midpoint on the back of a record third-quarter where we constructed nearly 1,500 sites. And on the M&A front, we added nearly 300 sites across our international footprint in Q3, bringing our year-to-date total to about 800, including more than 300 in Europe. Broadband connectivity across our international footprint has never been more critical, particularly, in markets with limited fixed-line access and we are working closely with our tenants to help them drive it. As part of these efforts, we have augmented several customer relationships recently, which we believe positioned us well to drive attractive growth while delivering high levels of service. We are already seeing benefits of these enhanced partnerships through accelerating organic growth in markets like Nigeria, and higher levels of new build activity in many of our other markets and expect these positive trends to continue over the long-term. Meanwhile, in India, the Supreme Court has ruled on a 10-year AGR repayment timeline for the carriers. We view this as a positive as it provides incremental clarity in the marketplace in near-term breathing room for the carriers in terms of their liquidity. While we believe it is too early for these positive developments to translate into significant improvements in our near-term operating results, they do provide a base for optimism for the longer term. As it relates to our 2020 outlook, outside of some more favorable projections for a bad debt due to better collections over the last few months, our operational expectations in India are essentially unchanged from our prior view. Now, please turn to Slide 8, and we will review our raised outlook midpoints. Our updated guidance for property revenue is $7.89 billion, which is an increase of $165 million, compared to our prior outlook and reflects a growth rate on a reported basis of 5.6%. On an FX neutral basis, the growth rate would be right around 10%. For the U.S. property segment, we now expect revenues of nearly $4.5 billion, which is $115 million above our prior projection. This is primarily being driven by about $105 million in incremental straight-line revenue attributable to our new T-Mobile MLA, as well as some other non-run rate outperformance in the business. For our International property segment, we now anticipate property revenue of $3.390 billion, which is $50 million higher than our prior projections. This is being driven by approximately $15 million in favorable FX impacts along with around $13 million in additional currency neutral pastures, and roughly $7 million in incremental straight-line revenue as well as $15 million or so in other outperformance throughout the business. Moving to the right side of the slide, we are reiterating our expectations for 4.5% to 5% consolidated organic tenant billings growth. This includes a projection of 4.5% for the U.S. and roughly 5% for international. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect an acceleration in gross new business activity in the U.S. beginning in early 2021, in part driven by our new agreement with T-Mobile. Turning to Slide 9, you can see that we now expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $5.1 billion, which is $170 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook and over11% greater than the prior year on an FX neutral basis. The primary drivers of this increase are approximately $105 million in an incremental net straight line, about $27 million and better than expected non-pass through, primarily non-run rate cash revenues around $28 million, and lower than expected non-pass through direct operating costs in cash SG&A, including $20 million and lower bad debt expectations in India in favorable FX impacts of roughly $5 million. For the year, we now expect cash SG&A as a percent of consolidated property revenue to be 8.2%, or around 7.2%, excluding bad debt reflecting continued scale benefits across the business. Lastly, we expect consolidated AFFO for the full year to be $3.75 billion at the midpoint, which is $75 million, or 2% above our prior outlook. On an FX-neutral basis, this reflects the growth of nearly 11% even including the $63 million one-time cash interest expense impact from our purchase of MTNs joint venture stakes in Africa earlier this year. The primary drivers of the increase as compared to our prior expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA outperformance I just mentioned, $20 million in lower net cash interest, and about $5 million in favorable FX impacts, partially offset by $10 million in additional expected maintenance capital spending. On a per share basis, we now expect to generate consolidated AFFO of $8.40, an increase of $0.17 as compared to the prior outlook. On an FX neutral basis, the year-on-year per share growth rate would be nearly 11%. Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our capital deployment expectations for the full year. Let me start by stating that we remain committed to our existing disciplined approach to capital allocation, which for many years has proven to be successful. This deep-rooted philosophy guides our decisions regarding dividends, capital expenditures, M&A and stock repurchases. For 2020, we expect our full-year dividend subject to board approval to be approximately $2 billion resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20%. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we expect the dividend growth rates in future years will likely be below 20% in line with our expected re-taxable income growth rates, again subject to the discretion of our board. Regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to deploy about $1.15 billion with more than 85% allocated towards discretionary projects. This is up to $75 million from our prior outlook, driven primarily by higher expected new build activity, as well as some acceleration in start-up capital spending and a small increase in maintenance CapEx. On the M&A front, we have spent roughly $860 million so far this year, including our previously mentioned purchase of the JV stake in Africa in the first quarter, and we are actively evaluating additional opportunities. Our previously announced purchase of the Tata's remaining stake in our India business is still pending regulatory approval in India. At quarter-end and exchange rates, this represents a purchase price of approximately $336 million, and for the purposes of outlook, we have assumed that this transaction will be finalized by the end of the year. And lastly, our year-to-date dividend declarations plus the $56 million we have deployed for stock repurchases, we have now returned about $1.5 billion to common stockholders so far in 2020. Turning now to Slide 11, I will briefly touch on our strong investment-grade balance sheet, which we believe will be a critical component of our continued growth. Since becoming an investment grade in late 2009, our balance sheet strength has allowed us to grow revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and consolidated AFFO per share, while maintaining prudent levels of liquidity and ensuring unobstructed access to capital at attractive rates. During the quarter, we accessed capital markets in the U.S. and Europe to issue roughly $2.8 billion across multiple tenures, including 30-years in both the U.S. dollar and euros. As of the end of the quarter, our average cost of debt stood at 2.9% more than 200 basis points below 2010 levels and average debt tenor was more than seven years, nearly two years in excess of where we were back in 2010. Our available liquidity totaled $6.7 billion, and our net leverage was 4.5 times, solidly within the three to five times target range. Taking all this balance sheet momentum into account, we believe that we are in a tremendous position of financial strength. Looking forward, we remain committed to our existing financial policies as we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, low cost of debt appropriate and consistent levels of leverage along with disciplined capital allocation decisions are essential to our ability to deliver attractive total shareholder returns over an extended period of time. On Slide 12 and in summary, we are positioned to finish the year strong with improving margins, enhanced strategic relationships with our tenants and continued opportunities to deploy capital towards accretive growth. Looking ahead, 5G deployment activity in the U.S. is poised to accelerate beginning in 2021, and we believe this will include material deployments of the mid-band spectrum, primarily in suburban and rural areas of the country where our towers are located. In addition, DISH is expected to begin building a nationwide network towards the back half of next year, driving potential future upside. Given our comprehensive portfolio of U.S. assets and mutually beneficial relationships with our tenants, we believe that we are well-positioned to drive a prolonged period of attractive contractually guaranteed U.S. growth. Meanwhile, we expect our diverse International Property segment to continue to perform well as global mobile network operator's deployed significant capital to deliver capable high-quality networks for their customers who are consuming more and more mobile data than ever before. Our international footprint of more than 140,000 sites is an excellent complement to our foundational U.S. asset base, and we expect that over the long term it will help us elongate and augment our growth trajectory. Finally, we believe that as a result of our strong balance sheet, our disciplined and steady approach to capital allocation, and most importantly because of our 5,500 experienced and talented employees across the globe, we are well-positioned to continue our long track record of driving consistent reoccurring consolidated AFFO per share growth, and growing dividend and attractive total shareholder returns. With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions. Yes. I'll add a couple of things. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. So the pickup that we are seeing going forward really is centered on T-Mobile as Tom alluded to. So, everybody knows that there was a slowdown from T-Mobile that began late in 2019 as they prepared for their merger with Sprint that persisted through most of 2020 to date. So that \u2013 now that we're lapping that, we've got a base of growth to grow from and that was the new T-Mobile deal, we have contracted levels of business going into 2021. So we do see an acceleration there. The other carriers have been pretty consistent through 2020, so that's been good to see this year so far. And then related to the churning part of your question, we do see that churn for T-Mobile happening over a multi-year period. It really will begin in late 2021, and go out for a few years, about four years. And we'll talk more about that Michael when we give guidance in February. Good Morning, Ric. Thanks, Ric. And Tom, if I could just add a couple of points there. So on the organic tenant billings growth, we did have a basically a flat organic tenant billings growth for the quarter in India. But we had about 2.3% added through the newbuild program that Tom just mentioned. So we built just shy of a thousand towers in India in the quarter. And I'll just remind everyone that in India, our day one returns on those new bills are solidly in the double digits. So even close to 14 %. And Jonathan, I'll just give you a few numbers here to support Tom's comment. So of the 5,500, India is going to be the lion's share of that probably close to 3,500. In Latin America maybe around 500. In Africa, you can think of that as about 1,300 or so in that range and handful in Europe, maybe 40 in Europe and in a small number in the U.S. Hi, Tim. Tim, I think the other part of your question was the breakdown of the sites that we acquired in Q3, so we acquired a little over 300 sites in Q3. 195 of those were in France through our arrangement with Orange, which we've talked about in the past. And then there was an additional block here in Chile and Peru, which are our additional tranches with the \u2013 on the Intel agreement that we have. So that makes up the majority of that that 305. So it's really in France, Chile, and Peru. Sure, Dave. I think you're referring to the Q3 numbers. So, the non-run rate items, they're primarily in India. We had a few settlements in India about $25 million worth of settlements in India that will not be recurring that were in our Q3 numbers. Correct."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thank you, Igor. Good morning everyone. Consistent with our past practice from our third quarter reports, my remarks today will center largely around the evolution of mobile technology and how we are positioning American Tower to benefit, specifically how we aim to extend our core neutral-host exclusive real estate portfolio to a digital multi-product, multi-service platform offering incremental value to existing and new customers. I'll also go into a bit more depth around two specific platform expansion initiatives, one in the United States and one outside of our core U.S. market. But before I elaborate on that topic, I wanted to briefly cover a few key points on the comprehensive master lease agreement, or MLA, that we signed with T-Mobile in mid-September. This agreement, which lasts through early 2035 augments our strategic relationship with T-Mobile, positions us to capture a significant new business with them over an extended period of time, and preserves the potential for incremental upside for us, particularly later on in the contract term. The MLA maintains the typical annual base escalator that we will recognize on the entire portfolio of included leases over the nearly 15-year term. This escalator is consistent with our historical 3% to 3.5% average rate included in our other U.S. based customer lease agreements. In addition to the base escalator, as is typical with our other comprehensive MLA agreements, there's an annual use fee or bonus escalator component. This additional annual use fee calculated as a percentage of the prior year's lease run rate is in force over the entire term of the agreement, and it allows T-Mobile to add equipment on certain sites up to pre-agreed loading levels. As a result of this use fee, we lock in contractually guaranteed revenue growth over and above the base escalator while T-Mobile will be able to more efficiently deploy their network, a win for both parties. In total, between their contracted backlog we already had in place before the deal, the approximately $17 billion in incremental contractual backlog from the agreement and a 10% or so of our T-Mobile revenues that sit outside of the MLA, we expect to generate at least $23 billion in total revenue from T-Mobile through the contract term and bring our total consolidated contractually committed revenue to more than $58 billion as of the end of Q3. This backlog incorporates the impact of cancellations included within the agreement, which in total is expected to represent around 4% of our consolidated property revenue at the time they occur. Included in these contractual terminations are principally the legacy Sprint revenues that we extended for 10 years back in 2011. As you may recall through that contract, we were able to delay the significant [indiscernible] that our peers experienced for more than five years. Having realized the NPV benefits from that, we will now see some of that deferred to commissioning flow through our run rate over a multi-year period. Once that is complete, we would expect to incur minimal levels of cancellations from T-Mobile over the remaining life of this agreement. Taken as a whole, we believe that our expanded relationship with T-Mobile will be important as we seek to generate double digit annual growth in the combination of our consolidated AFFO per share and dividend yield over the next decade. These types of comprehensive agreements have been incredibly valuable and strategic for us as we are better able to service our customers and consequently become more strategic to them as they densify their networks and deploy new spectrum. As a result, our cash flow generation becomes even more predictable providing us a solid foundation for continued investment in our business and generating further shareholder value. With that said, let me now turn our attention back to discussing how we are positioning American Tower to further benefit from the evolution of mobile technology. Our core global macro tower business has been and will continue to be the foundation of our success, and the primary driver of future cash flows. In fact, our conviction around macro towers being the primary infrastructure for 5G deployments has only increased. As more and more mid-band spectrum is deployed to support 5G, and this network usage continues to grow at upwards of 30% per year and even faster internationally, we believe that significant additional macro tower oriented network densification is inevitable. Recall that today we believe our consolidated customer base is spending upwards of $60 billion per year on building out their network. Going forward, there will be the need for even more equipment on more of our sites as carriers deploy massive MIMO and utilize DSS O-RAN, and then any other tools they have at their disposal to optimize their network performance and efficiency. In addition, as 5G and the surrounding ecosystem develops in the U.S. and this network technology continues to advance throughout our international footprint, we expect to have compelling opportunities to extend our core value proposition into new, related, accretive product and service offerings to expand our total addressable market. One of the key trends driving these opportunities is the continued convergence of wireless and wireline networks. We believe that this convergence along with increasing digitalization, network virtualization, and the agility of cloud native software-defined services will lead to increasing demand for distributed, interconnected, global-edge compute processing. As a result, the first mile of cloud OnRamp as this edge should become a more critical component of our customers' network architecture, and notably this edge is exactly where our exclusive communications real estate assets are located. To capitalize on the opportunities this network evolution is likely to present, we are focused on developing communications infrastructure business model that augment the value of our existing assets, expand our revenue base beyond traditional tenants, and enhance our leadership role in the wireless ecosystem. At the highest level, our goal is to selectively extend our digital infrastructure core capabilities to further encapsulate neutral hosted wireless connectivity, transport and compute functions as part of our comprehensive ATC platform. We can then offer tenants an integrated suite of complementary solutions to fit well within their ever more complex network designs. Within this framework, we intend to remain disciplined in terms of how we deploy capital and believe ventures with select partners could be the most efficient way to develop this platform extension. We expect our investments to focus on business models with several key elements: first, contracted long-term revenue commitments from Tier 1 customers; second, increasing ROIC with multi-tenancy, and multi-service offerings requiring modest ongoing maintenance CapEx; third, operating leverage characteristics similar to towers, we focus on our fixed costs; and fourth synergies and adjacencies with existing ATC assets and skill sets. So with that General backdrop in mind, let me dive deeper into a few specific areas where we are currently focusing our efforts with one example in the United States, and one offshore. In the United States, as 5G deployments accelerate, we expect the proliferation of lower latency applications, and incremental cloud-based customer demand for application level and network compute functions at the edge. There are two distinct solutions within this emerging ecosystem that we are paying attention to: distributed compute, and mobile edge compute. We believe that these two offerings will develop at different timelines and will allow us to provide differentiated value propositions for our customers. On the distributed compute side, enterprise workloads continue to move to the public cloud and a growing near-term market segment is the use of on or off-prem private cloud computing is a hybrid solution. Small and medium-sized businesses are often willing to move legacy workloads to more responsive, proximate, cost-effective data centers, and we believe that many data centers at some of our macro towers can represent optimal locations for these installations. We have started to deploy micro data center facilities at select tower sites, and have seen early indications of solid demand in collaboration with partners like Flexential. In the near-term, this solution enables us to develop operational excellence around the technology and iron out the kinks on a small scale. With that said, we don't necessarily think this use case alone will be the long-term driver of significant value for us. We expect true 5G mobile edge compute solutions to represent a much larger long-term opportunity. The foundational concept of our mobile edge strategy is the expectation that localized neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud micro data centers can be the most cost and technology efficient means to which latency can be reduced to the edge. And that these facilities can be optimally located at select macro tower sites that already have power, fiber, and multiple wireless tenants, rather than each cloud provider and carrier forging ahead with their own connectivity arrangements, our vision is to serve as the neutral host for these low latency relationships, which would drive cost efficiency, improve enter MNO application performance, and accelerate deployment of these facilities throughout the network. We expect this to be a multi-year rearchitecture process, and we are in the early stages of leveraging the knowledge that we've developed through Colo Atl in the small scale deployments at the tower sites I mentioned earlier, to determine the specifics of our go-forward strategy. They also mentioned these offerings in all likelihood will involve partnerships and joint ventures, as we continue to explore where in the value chain we can drive the most incremental upside. At this point, we think a scaled solution is still at least a few years away, but there is tangible progress being made and we are excited about the possibilities. Underlying this excitement of the potential future 5G related use cases that we expect to drive rapid uptake of mobile edge compute functions. Immersive AR and VR gaming applications are obvious examples. Autonomous Vehicle connectivity is another, including our involvement in C-V2X with partners like Qualcomm, and Audi. Next-generation drone delivery networks, real-time sensor-based data collection and analytics, and a host of other enterprise-oriented solutions are also on the way and will require significant levels of compute power on the network edge. Our objective today is to position American Tower to be ready to act decisively when the time is right to be a meaningful player in the space. Meanwhile on the international side, most of our markets are at least five years behind the U.S., in terms of deployed network technology. As a result, the edge compute opportunity and other potential 5G enabled business models are further down the road. The strategic advantage that we expect to have in these areas similar to what we did with our core tower business is the ability to prove out these models in the United States first, and then export them internationally when the time is right. Over time, we believe that our global interconnected reach will be critical in the context of an ever more global, multinational customer base, and their need to support their customer's global needs. In the meantime, one of the main focus areas of our platform extension efforts today throughout Africa and India especially, is on developing power as a service, to drive operational efficiency and cost savings, while materially reducing the carbon footprint of the wireless industry. Throughout much of Africa and India, the electric grid is inherently unreliable. It is part of our service offerings we are responsible for providing onsite power for our tenants. In the past, this was almost exclusively delivered through diesel generators with significant daily run times and diesel usage at considerable expense. More recently, as solar and lithium-ion battery technologies improve or becoming more cost-effective, we have accelerated our adoption of these technologies to make power provision in our sites more efficient, and environmentally friendly. In fact, as of the end of 2019, we had 12.3 megawatts of solar capacity already online with more than 4,500 sites utilizing lithium-ion batteries. To date, we've invested nearly $135 million on fuel and power optimization solutions, and expect to continue to make these investments as we improve site reliability levels for our tenants. As we disclosed in our latest sustainability report, our long-term target is to reduce our scope on fossil fuel consumption in diesel related greenhouse gas emissions in Africa and India by more than 60%, or 140 million liters of diesel annually by 2027. Already, we have made significant progress towards that objective having reduced annual diesel consumption by 65 million liters since 2017, after normalizing for site count growth. To give you a sense for what that translates to, it's essentially the equivalent of taking more than 35,000 cars off the road for a full year or preserving more than 65,000 acres of forest. In addition, we are currently exploring the development of science-based emissions targets consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. These initiatives are in their early stages. We are excited about the impact that we can make going forward. Just like in the United States where we are seeking to leverage our expanding platform to augment the value of our communication sites, we believe that we can translate our expertise and industry leadership in fuel and power internationally into tremendous added value. Reducing the total cost of ownership for our tenants further improving up times and developing more efficient, clean, renewable networks will benefit stakeholders across the value chain. We're committed to making substantial additional progress over the long-term. Just like in the United States where we are working on a number of other initiatives, we're continuing to look at things like fiber to the tower, fiber to the home, and other transport models in many of our international markets as ways to further broaden our addressable market and add value. These value propositions would all be predicated on long-term contractual commitments with multi-tenant and multi-service elements that mirror our existing tower model. In closing, on a global basis, we are in a time of tremendous technological digital transformation. Access to ubiquitous broadband connectivity has never been more important, particularly, in the context of the ongoing pandemic. There are new use cases emerging every day with modern wireless networks becoming more and more dynamic, responsive and critical. As providers of the underlying infrastructure that supports mobile connectivity for billions of people around the world, we have a unique advantage point from which to observe all of these developments. And I think we also have an incredible opportunity to pair our advantages and scale, financial resources, and global reach with our platform expansion initiatives to drive tremendous incremental value for our stakeholders over time in a sustainable way. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod, to go through our third quarter results, and updated full-year 2020 outlook. Hey Michael, maybe I'll start and then, Rod can come in. What we'll come out with specific guidance, obviously in February of next year when we release earnings. But what we are seeing is, as we said on the last call, we expect that a pickup in activity from T-Mobile. So there is going to be one of the principal drivers of the pickup particularly early on in 2021. As we see the level of activity picking up in the latter half of 2020. So there are going to be one of the principal, I think drivers of that pickup. And with regards to kind of the C-Band question what we've seen historically, you've seen this as clearly as well being so close to us and to what the carriers are doing. They're going to be taking advantage and leveraging every last megahertz they have of the spectrum. And so I think that they're not going to wait specifically for the new spectrum to be deployed there. That's going to fit right into their strategy at C-Band deployment schedule is going to be over a multi-year. And so they're going to continue to build out their current 5G if you will, along the same kind of layered cake kind of spectrum capacity that we've talked about in the past. So we would expect that the carriers are going to continue to spend, continue to meet their own customers' needs, and they're doing it differently. As you well know, they're doing it across many different bands. But they're going to continue to deploy. So as I said, we'll provide more detail on that deployment in our Q4 call. But we're obviously, very bullish in terms of how we would see 2021. And Rod, you have anything to add. Well, I think as I mentioned before Ric. There are two escalators that are part of this agreement. As is typical with similar types of the agreement, we have the base escalator which we have in all as you well know in all of our agreements \u2013 master agreements which are in the 3% to 3.5% range. And that will stay fixed for the entire term of the contract. On top of that is our \u2013 what we call is our use fee or our second escalator that's on top of the base escalator. And that escalator allows then \u2013 and that on an annual basis, and it's and it's determined based upon the prior year, monthly or the ending year run rates. And that then allows T-Mobile to add equipment up to preloading agreements, up to certain rights on the agreement themselves. And that escalator is also in force over the lane of the contract. Now that second escalator unlike the first does decrease over time really as a result of the base getting bigger. So it's a slightly lower escalator that it's applied to a higher base to drive consistent rate of incremental growth. And so the comment was that I believe that it does de-escalate. And on that second escalator the way we think about that, that is in fact true. But it's really as I said, a function of that the base is getting bigger. And so you have a slightly lower use fee escalator being applied to it to keep a consistent rate of incremental growth, again, as part of the comprehensive or holistic agreement over the entire term of the agreement. So that I think, I'm trying to tie to connect the dots and tie it together. That's fundamentally how that agreement, both escalators will work. That's something that we are thinking about. I mean I've been spending time with Rod and Igor. So that's very, very possible Ric, just to give people a sense of what it might look like on a multi-year period given the churn that we are expecting in as a result of the, kind of the Sprint leases coming off. But that's very possible. We know, on the Dish question, I don't want to get into any specifics with them or as you would expect, we're in significant conversations with them, as we're always talking to customers. They've stated that they are looking to start to build out their network. I believe in the second half of the year, and so we want to make sure that we're there for them enable to service them to the extent that we can. So there are, candidly, a lot of conversation going on there. As I said that we'd like we have with all our customers. On the C-Band that's possible in anticipation of that spectrum being deployed, carriers getting ready to be able to participate in that. That's always an opportunity we believe. I'm not sure how material that would be, candidly, Ric at this point in time, it's hard to tell. The likes of Verizon, AT&T, I mean they deploy capital in a very regimented kind of measured way. And so it's hard to say that would materially change the timing or direction of growth rates. But it's very possible that there might be some acceleration of some growth as a result of that band in particular becoming available. We've \u2013 and by the way we have cable customers today. Again, I don't want to get any specifics there Ric, particularly as it relates to new entrants into the market. But we're obviously, I think well positioned to be able to service them to the extent that they go down that path. Yes. You too, Ric. Be well. Yes. Hey Matt. Hey, thanks. Thanks for the question. I think on the contrary on international markets. I continually see incredible densification initiatives and new newbuild projects going on in just about all of the markets whether it's Mexico, Brazil, down in Latin America, Africa. We're seeing significant increases in demand for build to suit new co-locations orders. So I can go by market and I can see significant levels of increase in Colo orders as well as build to suit. As Rod said, I would continue to set records on build to suit activities. So I think that's just indicative of the amount of densification that's going on around the globe. With particularly in India, in India again, we hit on a gross basis kind of double-digit growth rates. And so what we see continued demand there. I think there has been a general slowdown overall, not just regards to COVID, but I think also with regard to clearing through a lot of the AGR, a lot of tax issues, I think that put a slowdown if you will. Some of the levels of the spend that the carriers were doing in the marketplace. But hopefully, much of that will be behind us and the carriers I now \u2013 I know are really starting to think about and move forward in terms of looking to increase kind of rates of growth going forward. COVID has impacted some of the build to suit activity in the marketplace in terms of getting permits and some of those types of things. And as you well know, I mean India has really struggled as much of the world. But in particular, India has struggled with COVID, particularly over the last several months. So I know that has actually slowed down some of the build to suit activity. But on the growth side, the market is very strong. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes. Hey, thanks, Jon. We'll get in the specifics for 2021 and on our next quarter's call. I think as we've alluded to it, we've talked that we would expect an increase in the gross in the U.S. business. Michael if that wouldn't be before and I think it's a function of some of the activity that we're seeing happen with T-Mobile. And we're very bullish on what's going on in the U.S. markets. I mean not a lot of different fronts not just in terms of the new spectrum, new technology being deployed, but potential new entrants into the market continued growth in demand. Even though the realization process that the government is driving in terms of trying to ensure that broadband is therefore for all. I mean I think all of these would clearly give us a bullish sense of what we would expect in the U.S. market over the next couple of years. And in particular in 2021, just on top of the ongoing demand that we see going on from a network usage perspective. Internationally, in each of the markets we \u2013 just in terms of guidance for 2020, I mean all of the markets are up from a revenue perspective. As I mentioned before they're significant densification efforts going on in all of the markets. You can always go market-by-market and look at various metrics, and you can \u2013 you can see that there is a significant new infrastructure that needs to be added. New sites that need to be added in those markets to be able to support the growth that they have going on in those markets. And so, as we've always said, and as you well know, the international markets are a couple of technologies behind generally. And so \u2013 and without any really strong wireline capability, and so on \u2013 and a pandemic even the market, the world that we're living in today there's even more of a demand for wireless infrastructure in those markets. And so, I think all of that gives a good backdrop for what we would expect growth to look like in the internationally in those markets. We've always said it's going to be 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than we're seeing in the United States. And if you take a look at even in Q3, you look at Latin America; you look at Africa they're all up in the kind of 7% to 8% range. And so, it's \u2013 the model works. I think the strategy works and we're very bullish in terms of what we're expecting to see in our international markets over the next several years. I mean, I think we have. I mean Rod can give the one. I mean India was up a bit. We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there. So there's an outsized, probably piece of that 5,500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria \u2013 markets like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets there we're seeing upticks in the overall build to suit the activity. Brazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today. I think to be able to meet the demand and provide a good quality signal, and so we're seeing increased demand for site builds in Brazil as well. So it's a bit of a mix across the three of them I'd say. And I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to see continued increases in rates that built the suit going forward. It's our best rate of return capital dollars spent in the business. And so, we work very closely with our carriers to be able to kind of maximize that category of CapEx. Yes. Sure. No, Tim. The churn in the \u2013 as we said multi-year, three to four years that you would expect to see a lot of that churn flush through. So hopefully that will give you a sense of the time period on that. Europe has always been a market. We've been looking at Europe for, and getting deeper into the region for many, many years. And we've always struggled from a valuation perspective and a growth perspective. We think of the U.S. business being the largest driver of cash flow as kind of the developed market and create a consistent rate of growth. And then we've looked at our Europe, our international markets candidly as ways to increase the slope of the curve from a cash flow growth perspective. And so we're willing and have been able to take some higher levels of risk if you will going into international markets using significantly higher risk-adjusted hurdle rates. But really is a function of the core U.S. business. And so when we take a look at Europe as being somewhat \u2013 more of a developed market, the growth rates have just not been particularly strong. I mean the beachfront properties that we have in France, and Germany and now just entered into Poland; the growth rates have been in the 2% to 4% kind of rate of growth. And so when we think about allocating capital that generally hasn't been overly exciting, candidly in terms of the overall rates of growth. And then when we take a look at the underlying valuations for a lot of the assets in the particular markets, we really struggle with some of the growth expectations that you would have to realize to be able to support some of the underlying valuations for those assets. Now, we're \u2013 given the size and kind of the scope of American Tower, we're part of every deal that goes down in the region. And so, we're watching it very closely. We're participating in certain areas. As you said, we're undersized, I guess, relative to some of the \u2013 to Cellnex, for example, in the marketplace. But that's okay. I mean we're \u2013 that doesn't bother me in terms of our presence. We're going to continue to look at a deal by every deal on its own and take a look at the underlying variables of the deal and expectations of the deal and to the extent that the ROI and the NPDs can be sizeable. We'll look to participate in it and see kind of where we land in terms of being successful there. But just because we're relatively under sized versus the other players in the marketplace that doesn't concern me at all. We're all here about creating AFFO per share growth and ROIC growth, and to the extent that they can contribute to those two variables. We're going to weigh in and participate. So, we'll see where that lands over and it will continue to develop. There are a lot of assets, as you said. They're going to be coming up on the marketplace. There are a lot of large carriers, who are looking to monetize their assets. So, there very well could be some opportunities there. And as I said, we'll just take a look at them one at a time. Hi, Dave. Yes, Dave, I mean, I don't think that's the case candidly. I think given the real estate that we have and the sites that we have, we're quite comfortable that the carriers are always going to have to come to us. I mean, that's kind of the beauty of the business that we have and the real estate that we have. I mean, we're always in negotiations with all the carriers. We're trying to meet their needs along the way is any typical kind of lesser or lessee kind of a relationship, but I don't think there's any real credence to the fact that there's leverage that's created as a result of moving or not coming onto our sites. I mean, we have a very long-term view of our business, of our customer base. We think that I think that's indicative of kind of the 15-year agreement that we put in place with T-Mobile. We think that, as we said in the past, that these types of master lease agreements are incredibly strategic and important to us for a number of reasons, not just to driving sizable predictable growth, but we also see really very sizable growth overall as a result of the additional right to use kind of base escalator. Historically, if you look at ATC in the United States, we've garnered, we generated over 50% of the new business in the United States on a fairly consistent basis. And so, I think that's indicative of the types of relationships that we have with our carriers over time. Are there always other issues in terms of some of the negotiations, sure we get some high priced sites, sites that have been out there for a very long period of time that have escalators on them. And we work very closely with the carriers then to try to bring those back to market, but then generating other types of value for us over a long time. So we're in constant \u2013 I'm in constant conversations with our U.S. customers. And so, I don't see that kind of activity. And if it does, as I said, it would be noise and it would not impact the way we think about our business or the way we strike kind of long-term lease agreements with any of our customers. Right. No, no, I appreciate it. Thanks for the question. I tried to cover that in some of my prepared remarks. I mean, it's the highest level. We're really trying to create tower like communications infrastructure business models. They really augment, if you will, the value of our existing assets, expand our revenue base beyond the traditional tenants if you will and expand our role in that whole delivery system. It's all about extending the platform. And clearly part of that platform is that compute capability. And so, we're looking as part of that platform and the compute transport functions and really trying to create ways of being able to incrementally provide service to our customers. And so, if you think about kind of our longer term views of it, we're candidly looking at okay of the 40,000 sites in the United States, which could all be considered edge compute locations. It is at the edge. It is at the very edge of the edge if you will. How many of those sites would fit well in terms of fitting them out to be able to support the number of enterprise accounts, to support hyperscalers, to supplier data centers in ways where we can provide and be really part of that process to provide lower latency types of applications. And at each one of those sites then given kind of the real estate that we have, how many shelters can we put at each one of those locations, how much power can we drop into each one of those shelters and how many comes down to how many cabinets can we load up in each one of those new shelters? And so, we're looking at sites that potentially can hold two or three shelters, each shelter holding 8 to 10 cabs each providing 100 kilowatt of power into each one of those shelters themselves in a way that it can provide them kind of really an on-ramp for accounts in that particular location into the wireless world. And so, the models that we have and the trials that we have right now are trialing exactly that. And looking at then what are the price points for each one of those cabinets, can we get a traditional kind of $1,900 to $2,000 per cab in each one of those locations. How stackable are the shelters going to be? And then \u2013 and really looking at what that demand is. And so, we have several proof-of-concepts that we're working on in tandem with some potential partners and actually are looking at those now in front of certain enterprises to be able to determine really what is the opportunity there. In terms of how far we go along the kind of the value prop scale, that to be determined. Clearly, we have co-location in real estate, so those are kind of given. Then the question is, okay, how far do we go up the stack and then how do we provide those kinds of capabilities? As I mentioned in my remarks, it's not like we're looking to hire 1,000 software engineers or 2,000 sales reps to start selling into enterprise accounts and providing them access to cloud-based services. That's not our skill set. And so we would look to augment our capabilities with other capabilities to be able to jointly provide what we think could be a very interesting value proposition to the enterprise accounts around the country. So, time will tell. However, this is in early stages now. As I said, we're really dedicated. We have a number of resources dedicated to try to understand what this is, what the CapEx requirements are going to be at the site location and really again to come back to driving tower like communications infrastructure business models. So that's it, and kind of a short \u2013 a couple of sound bites. And you'll continually hear more and more about our strategy there as it develops and as we continue to go down the journey. As I mentioned before, traditionally our international markets are a couple of technologies behind where they are in the United States. Having said that though, I think one of the real advantages that we bring to a venture is our global reach and the lack of really processing capability in many of our emerging markets that we have today. And so, while I think the strategy will probably more \u2013 will initially develop in the United States. I think the real value, ultimately, particularly as the \u2013 as the world shrinks. And as the cloud learns \u2013 we'll connect this off and does move to the edge. I think that our global reach is actually a real interesting element to what, as I said, we bring to the party. And so, it's difficult to say how the outside of the United States market might develop. We might find in certain markets that it may develop more quickly and that the kind of the edge compute capability turns into more than just in edge. You may be able to cluster certain edges to provide more of a metro data facility. Again \u2013 and particularly in areas of the world where there really isn't a lot of data center presence. So it will be very interesting question and one we're kind of getting our arms around and understanding exactly what are the benefits as a result of having that global reach? I think candidly that they're significant and we'll try to leverage that as much as we possibly can. You bet. Yes. No, thanks. Let me start and Rod to get in to add any additional color. On the straight line, I mean, it's \u2013 we're just refining the calculations as you might expect. It's a very complicated calculation. And so, it was just a kind of refinement of the calculation as that we were able to do. So there's nothing remarkable, I think, going on with regards to the actual straight line calculation. And with regards to your other question, I mean, all of our contracts are designed to take more than our fair share of the business. And as I mentioned before, historically in the United States we've captured over 50% of the new business in the United States. And so our contracts are designed to do that, but in a way that's providing a meaningful capability and service to our customers. And so with regards to the agreement that we put in T-Mobile, we are absolutely, we believe more strategic to them. We're working side-by-side with them on a number of different initiatives as we typically do when we enter into these types of relationships. Clearly, there is a desire for them to one to put more equipment on our sites as a result of the fact that they're already paying for it. And so, as a result of that, we would think that we would get an outsized part of their business. And so this is no different. And so to the extent that there's acceleration, there are different initiatives that they're looking to undertake, which knowing T-Mobile, we would expect so. We would hope that we would be really in the catbird seat in terms of being able to pick up a lot of that incremental business. And that's, as I said, historically, what these kinds of comprehensive holistic master lease agreements have really positioned us to be able to take advantage of that we hope so."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nIgor Khislavsky: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to you throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Before the rest of my comments, I'll note that due to COVID-19, all of us on the call this morning are again dialing in remotely from different locations. So to the extent there are any minor technical difficulties, we would ask that you bear with us.  Our agenda for this morning will be as follows: First, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the second quarter; next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO will provide an overview of our international business and the associated key trends and returns; and then finally, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer will discuss our second quarter results and updated 2020 outlook. After these comments, we will take your questions. I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include: our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2020 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance, our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include, the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the quarter. During the quarter, our property revenue increased 2.4% to nearly $1.9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA also grew by 2.4% to over $1.2 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 1.6% and 1.5% respectively to $924 million and $2.07. On an FX neutral basis, growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 8.6%, 7.6% and 7.4% respectively.  Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by roughly 4% to $446 million or $1 per diluted common share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Okay, thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. I hope that you are all healthy and well. As we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers, and surrounding communities. The remote work policies I mentioned on our last call continue to service well throughout our global footprint.  And I am pleased to say that there are even a few geographies where certain employees have been able to return to the office with numerous incremental safety measures in place. I am also happy to report that our business continues to perform well as we work closely with our tenants to preserve and enhance mobile connectivity, when it is needed the most.  And outside of FX impacts, which have moderated slightly over the last few months, we have to this point not seen material impacts from COVID-19 on our operations. As we move forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to provide high levels of service and drive solid results. The rest of my remarks today, similar to prior second quarter calls, will center on the key trends in return profiles we are seeing across our international business and what we expect in the future.  Since we entered Brazil and Mexico back in the late 1990s to provide geographic diversification to our foundational U.S. business, we\u2019ve added nearly 140,000 communication sites in 19 countries outside of United States, focusing on partnering with large multinational wireless carriers in select markets with strong property rights, rules of law and vibrant wireless industries.  Since day one of our international expansion strategy, our mandate has been clear, build and acquire multitenant exclusive franchise real estate assets that would generate attractive organic growth rates, while driving margin expansion and growing returns on invested capital overt the long-term.  And so with an emphasis on building leading market positions in the largest democracies across the world with a goal of positioning ourselves is either the top one or two tower company in each market.  This strategy has been underpinned by our proven risk underwriting process including among other things contemplating FX movements and local country inflation trends. As we discussed with you before, all of our investments are evaluated using a ten year unlevered DCF model with varying IRR hurdles due to the inclusion of appropriate risk adjustments to account for the specific local country risk, the type of that asset counterparty and a host of other factors.  These hurdles range from the mid-to-high single-digits in markets like the United States and Western Europe, to the mid-to-high teens in some of our more nascent African markets to ensure that our shareholders are being appropriately compensated for the level of risk being assumed.  This balanced approach to market risk has enabled us to evaluate each individual investment opportunity in the context of its risk-adjusted return profile, long-term AFFO accretion potential and the NPV expected to be generated rather than utilizing a specific cap as to how big any market or region can get or should get in relation to the United States.  Operationally, we are also executing a number of risk mitigation strategies. For example, our MLAs include primarily local CPI-based escalators. Our overall portfolio has significant diversification. And we selectively issue local currency debt where it makes sense.  Further, the vast majority of our local country generated net cash flows are denominated in the local currency and we are generally reinvesting those same cash flows back into those very same markets.  Lastly, we have mechanisms in place through which we are able to pass through the cost of land to our tenants in Latin America and the cost of fuel and power to our tenants across India and Africa, helping to further derisk significant portions of our operating expenses across these regions.  Taking all of these items into account, we believe we have a risk evaluation and mitigation framework that will enable us to continue to be successful internationally over the long-term. Within this context the primary thesis underlying our global strategy has always been and continues to be that the evolution of network technology that we\u2019ve seen in the United States will be replicated internationally, likely at an accelerated pace given the lack of fixed line penetration in many areas.  Our U.S. business model and international model are effectively the same. The sites look the same, the structures are comparable and the MLAs are fundamentally similar, but include the risk mitigation terms I discussed earlier. At the core, our international expansion serves as a way to significantly increase our total addressable market.  As consumers gain access to advanced smartphone handsets and mobile data usage increases, mobile network operators continue to deploy meaningful wireless CapEx. Service providers in international markets where we have a presence are expected to spend approximately $30 billion on their networks in 2020, in essence doubling the TAM of our U.S. market alone.  With mobile broadband penetration growing, we continue to expect to generate higher organic growth rates internationally and in the United States over the long-term while driving meaningful expansion in our international return on invested capital.  Fundamentally, we are utilizing our international strategy to increase and extend our overall global return profile. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has served to further highlight the criticality of wireless connectivity internationally, particularly in markets where fixed line penetration is minimum.  Unlike in the United States, where most of us are plugging into our Wi-Fi-enabled fixed line connections, as we work from home, mobile networks serve as the backbone of virtually all work-from-home functions in each international locations.  And as you can imagine, broad based stay-at-home orders and other restrictions that have been implemented in these markets over the last several months have led to additional strain in existing mobile networks.  For example, Vodafone Idea in India noted that they experienced a year\u2019s worth of data traffic across their network in a single week following the implementation of lockdown measures. Similarly, major carriers across Latin America, Africa and Europe have outlined significant spikes in data usage and regulators have allocated additional temporary spectrum and implemented other policies to help maintain connectivity.  As I mentioned earlier, we are committed to doing everything we can to support our tenants as they deal with the strain of this increased usage on their networks.  Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the attractive economics that we are driving across our international business. In the second quarter, our international operations accounted for approximately 43% of our property revenue and about a third of our property operating profit.  Our international tower and DAS properties drove an annualized cash gross margin of over $1.8 billion in the quarter resulting in a nearly 9.5% NOI yield on our more than $19 billion in total international tower and DAS investments, as you can see on Slide 6 of our earnings presentation.  This NOI yield includes both sites that we have recently acquired, as well as sites that have been in our portfolio for a number of years benefiting from long-term tenancy and revenue growth. Our most seasoned vintage of international sites those built or acquired prior to 2010 is yielding approximately 24% in U.S. dollar terms illustrating the power of operating leverage within our business.  We view this type of return profile as a clear indication that international tower assets have the capacity to drive economics that are equal to or better than the United States tower model over the long-term.  Importantly, I\u2019ll note that the NOI yield numbers I am referencing today are U.S. dollar equivalents. That is they take into account any foreign currency devaluation in a numerator, while freezing the denominator at historical exchange rates in the period in which the sites were acquired or built.  Over the last 20 years and especially since 2007, we have been steadily growing our international portfolio with a focus on macro towers in some of the largest three market democracies worldwide through a combination of our highly efficient newbuild programs and selective acquisitions including the Eaton Towers deal we closed at the end of last year.  We\u2019ve added more than a 130,000 international sites in just the last decade including more than 24,000 sites we built ourselves. These sites typically have lower initial returns due to lower initial tenancy. You can see this on the slide where sites we\u2019ve added to our international portfolio between 2010 and 2014 are generating yields of 10% and those added since 2015 are generating yields of around 8%.  Over time, our experience across all of our served markets has been that as networks mature, additional spectrum bands are deployed and consumers obtained advanced handsets both daily usage grows exponentially and significant additional network density becomes a necessity.  As a result, we\u2019ve seen sites that have initially produced modest returns, attract collocations and amendments with minimal incremental costs, thereby driving substantial upside over time, no different than what we\u2019ve experienced in the United States.  In Latin America, where we have owned and operated towers for now over two decades have invested approximately $8 billion and now have over 41,000 sites across eight countries, 4G deployments are in full swing. Our long time presence and scale have resulted in substantial business relationships with key operators in the region including AT&T, American Mobile and a number of others.  These relationships coupled with our extensive asset base has enabled us to drive average organic billings growth of around 10% in the region over the last five years, that\u2019s by strong levels of new business activity and a continuing appetite for mobile data. Although organic growth rates are down a bit in 2020 in part due to falling local CPI, we continue to expect a long trajectory of solid underlying growth.  We are also focused on a new build program if network densification efforts accelerate. In fact, we expect to construct over 500 sites across Latin America this year and anticipate strong demand for new builds in the region over a multiyear period.  Importantly, these new builds typically have day one NOI yields in the high-single-digit range with just one tenant with an average tenancy ratio of around 1.5 across the region, we believe we are well positioned to drive meaningful margin and return accretion in Latin America for many years to come.  In Africa, the majority of our markets are in earlier stages of the technology evolution with 4G penetration only around 10% and average mobile data usage being a fraction of LATAM numbers as a result. We\u2019ve invested approximately $5 billion across the continent and have an average tenancy of around 1.5 on our portfolio of nearly 19,000 sites, which are yielding roughly 11%.  Importantly, we partnered with key telecom operators like Vodafone, MTN and AirTel to bring enhanced connectivity to hundreds of millions of people. With extremely limited fixed line penetration, young tech savvy populations, and governments committed to modernizing economies through connectivity, we expect mobile broadband to play a foundational role in Africa\u2019s growth story over the next decade plus.  We also anticipate that continued organic growth, our new build program through which we expect to construct well over a 1,000 sites this year, and our ongoing business development efforts will enable us to build on the strong foundation we\u2019ve created in Africa as we deliver solid growth and increasing returns over the long-term.  At the same time, we are making substantial progress in our commitment to reduce the mobile industry\u2019s carbon footprint through our innovative power and fuel program. In African markets, where grid power in many areas tends to be unreliable, we are now deploying next-generation greener technologies including lithium ion batteries and solar solutions.  We expect to invest more than $60 million in 2020 to enhance the uptime performance of our sites in the region, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions after deploying an excess of $100 million over the last few years. Not only do these initiatives benefit our tenants through higher uptimes and more efficient operating capabilities, but also they represent a critical part of our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen.  These investments have helped enable us to reduce diesel consumption by more than 25% from 2017 to 2019 across our global footprint after normalizing for portfolio growth. Meanwhile, in Europe, where we have nearly 5,000 sites between Germany and France, and recently entered Poland by acquiring a handful of towers, networks are at a fairly mature stage with 4G having been broadly deployed over the last decade. \n, : Consequently, we continue to look for ways to expand our European portfolio, but only at valuations that with underlying growth expectations allow us to hit our required return thresholds. Our entry into Poland, although on a small-scale initially is an example of our continued focus on finding macro tower portfolios poised for sustainable growth in markets with attractive regulatory frameworks, supportive regulators, and vibrant wireless sectors, all at sensible valuations.  And finally, moving to India, where we will have invested over $5 billion, pro forma redeeming our minority interest, we believe the wireless industry has now completed a much needed and long awaited consolidation to enable the deployment of 4G technology throughout the country by the remaining carriers. Through this process, we\u2019ve experienced high levels of churns which is reflected in our current 8% NOI yield.  Although I\u2019d note that the more than $400 million in cash settlement payments we\u2019ve received from TATA are not incorporated in that number or it would be higher.  More recently, there have been pricing increases by all of the carriers in the marketplace, while the telecom regulator has indicated that it intends to be supportive of the carriers to rational spectrum policies and the Indian government continues to stress its Digital India initiative.  The key near-term issue that needs to get sorted out in the marketplace centers on the AGR decision by the Supreme Court including finalizing the timeline as to when the wireless carrier payments are to be made, particularly as it relates to Vodafone Idea. We are hopeful that India can return to being a significant growth engine for the company as it was for nearly a decade before the consolidation process kicked off several years ago.  We have several reasons for optimism in this regard. As I just mentioned, the market structure is now much more rational. Price competition in wireless has stabilized and the regulatory environment seems constructive. The Indian consumer has proven to have a tremendous appetite for mobile data with average smartphone usage per customer of well 10-gigabits per month, even before the impacts of COVID-19.  With that said, the majority of wireless users in India are still using legacy technologies, rather than 4G in large part because the networks are ill equipped and their current state to handle levels of traffic for more than 1 billion people. To get those networks ready, we continue to believe that significant levels of incremental network spending are necessary accompanied by material level of network densification.  With our nearly 75,000 site existing portfolio, and the additional sites we are adding through our new build program, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from our tenants\u2019 network deployments over an extended period of time.  Additionally, we are continuing to meaningfully participate in connecting the unconnected in India through our Digital Village program with more than a 150 Digital Villages in place today and more in development, we are proud to be making a difference in the areas of digital literacy, e-learning, tower help, as well as providing enhanced access to career opportunities in many rural Indian communities.  Looking forward, we believe that we have a compelling opportunity to further enhance our international business by driving organic growth, focusing on operational efficiency and continuing to build and acquire sites using our proven investment evaluation methodology. Our preference continues to be to add incremental scale to existing markets, while strengthening ties with large multinational wireless carriers.  But there are handful of additional markets that could be attractive for us as well. We also believe there are additional opportunities to generate margin improvement as we further standardize operational processes, create regional centers of excellence and further reduce our power and fuel requirements. We also believe there will be demand for many of our innovative initiatives to extend our core platform of capabilities for new and existing tenants.  So in summary, we believe that our diverse macro tower-focused international portfolio positions us well for a prolonged period of solid growth and attractive returns on invested capital. We can further augment this to disciplined selection acquisitions in new builds on a global basis. While we expect our foundational U.S. business to drive the majority of our cash flows for years to come, we think our international operations can enhance and extend our growth trajectory by effectively doubling our total addressable market size.  The global demand for mobile connectivity shows no sign of slowing and we believe we are positioned to play a critical role in extending the reach of mobile broadband, while generating strong total returns for our shareholders.  So, with that, let me hand it over to Rod to go through the details of our results and updated outlook. Rod? \nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. I hope you are safe and healthy. As you saw in today's press release, we had another solid quarter throughout our global business, driven by consistent demand for our mission-critical tower assets.  Before we turn to the accompanying charts, I would like to highlight a few specific accomplishments for the quarter. First, we met our revenue. Adjusted EBITDA consolidated AFFO expectations which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Second, we had solid organic tenant billings growth across our business led by Africa at nearly 10% and Latin America at over 7%. Third, we constructed more than 500 towers across our international footprint. And finally, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet by issuing $2 billion in senior unsecured notes across multiple tenors with very attractive economics.  Now, let\u2019s turn to the details of our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8 and we will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. Although we experienced some unfavorable FX translational impact, primarily resulting from the global pandemic, overall, we generated solid underlying revenue growth.  In the interest of understanding our fundamental operational performance, I\u2019ll be referring to growth rates for some of our key metrics on an FX neutral basis in addition to our standard as-reported basis.  As Igor mentioned earlier, our second quarter consolidated property revenue of nearly $1,900 million grew on a reported basis by $44 million or 2.4% over the prior year period. And on an FX neutral basis by $158 million or 8.6%.  Our U.S. segment represented 57% of our consolidated property revenue with international comprising the remaining 43%. A key contributor to our consolidated property revenue was our tenant billings revenue of $1,620 million, which grew by nearly 10%. The components of our tenant billings growth included around $71 million in colocation and amendments.  Roughly $50 million in contributions from escalators and $72 million in day one tenant billings from acquisitions and new builds. These positive items were partially offset by churn impacts of $46 million and $2 million in other items.  Our U.S. property segment revenue totaled nearly $1,100 million for the quarter and grew by $80 million or 8% over the prior year period. Our international property revenue of nearly $806 million declined by $36 million or 4.3% as compared to last year\u2019s levels, primarily due to the FX translational headwinds we just discussed.  Moving to the right-side of the slide, you will see that our consolidated organic tenant billings growth was in line with our expectations at 5% for the quarter. For our U.S. property segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.7% comprised of new business activity which contributed 3.7%, escalators, which contributed 3.2%, churn of 1.9% and a roughly 30 basis points negative impact from other items.  As expected, this growth rate reflects a sequential deceleration driven primarily by relatively modest contributions to our new business from T-Mobile over the last few quarters.  With that said, and as I will discuss in more detail when we review our updated outlook, we have seen new business activity from T-Mobile begin to pickup with further acceleration anticipated towards the end of the year.  Our international property segment organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, led by Africa at nearly 10% and Latin America at over 7%. Europe was just over 2%, while India was 0.4%, again, in line with our expectations given anticipated churn and general market conditions.  The component parts of international organic tenant billings growth where new business activity which totaled nearly 7% are mostly local inflation-based pricing escalators which contributed 3.7% and other items which contributed around 20 basis points. These items were partially offset by churn of 5.3%, much of which was in India.  Now, please turn to Slide 9 and we will review our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO results. Our second quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1.2 billion grew on a reported basis by about $28 million or 2.4% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by $19 million or 7.6%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.3%, up roughly 70 basis points over the prior year.  This increase was attributable to a combination of our solid organic growth, diligent focus on cost controls, and a favorable impact of some incremental net straight-line. These favorable impacts were partially offset by approximately $21 million in bad debt reserves, against certain receivables in India.  Although we operate in 20 countries, our U.S. business again drove the substantial majority of our property segment operating profit in the quarter accounting for 68% of the total, while our international business generated the remaining 32%.  Moving to the right-side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $924 million grew on a reported basis by nearly $15 million or 1.6% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by around $69 million or 7.5%.  Consolidated AFFO per share of $2.07grew on a reported basis by $0.03 or 1.5% over last year\u2019s levels and on an FX neutral basis grew by $0.15 or 7.4%. This growth in AFFO and AFFO per share was driven by our previously discussed growth in adjusted EBITDA, as well as interest expense management, careful oversight of cash taxes and lower maintenance capital spending.  Let\u2019s now take a look at our updated expectations for 2020. Before I get into the numbers, I want to cover a few of our high-level assumptions. First is our updated expectation regarding the post-merger acceleration in new business activity from T-Mobile. Our prior outlook assumed activity levels would have materially increased by now and that we would be seeing increased levels of new business from T-Mobile starting this month.  Although, we have seen a modest increase in activity, it has not yet reached the level we expect to eventually see, based on the T-Mobile\u2019s public comments. As a result, we now expect this acceleration of new business to come much later this year. Consequently, we are reducing our U.S. organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2020, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Next is our updated expectations regarding customer collections and additional reserves for some bad debt. For the most part, tenants throughout our footprint have continued to pay on-time and without interruption through the pandemic.  However, in India, we have layered in approximately $65 million in additional bad debt assumptions for the full year. This is primarily attributable to the expected timing of payments from the government owned carrier BSNL, as well as the possibility that Vodafone Idea future payments become interrupted or delayed as they weigh a final outcome of the ongoing AGR court proceedings in India.  Additionally, we have assumed roughly $10 million in incremental bad debt reserves for a few tenants in Africa.  Lastly, we have updated the foreign currency exchange rates in our full year outlook. The impacts of these revised FX rates on full year expectations, as compared to our prior guidance are estimated to be a positive $45 million of property revenue, $20 million for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO.  Aside from these adjustments, our other high-level assumptions remain largely consistent with our prior view as demand for our telecommunications real estate across all of our markets is expected to remain solid.  If you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 10, I will now review our revised outlook midpoints. Our updated guidance for property revenue is $7,720 million, which is a decrease of $30 million compared to the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects a growth rate on a reported basis of 3.4%. On an FX neutral basis, the growth rate is approximately 8%.  For our U.S. segment, we now expect property revenue of $4,380 million, which is $35 million lower than our prior projections. About $20 million of this decrease is attributable to the timing of T-Mobile activity with the remaining $15 million or so being driven by an adjustment in our non-cash straight-line revenue expectations as a result of an accounting true-up.  For our International segment, we now anticipate property revenue of $3,340 million, which is $5 million higher than our prior expectation. This is being driven by roughly $45 million in favorable FX impacts, along with around $10 million in other outperformance, partially offset by a $50 million currency neutral decline in pass-through revenues across our footprint due to lower fuel prices.  At a high level, our expectations for our international businesses are broadly consistent with our prior outlook, which demonstrates the critical nature of our assets, as well as the effectiveness of our more than 5,000 employees across the globe. We could not be more proud of the way our global teams have performed throughout this pandemic.  Moving on to the right-side of the slide, we now expect organic tenant billings growth to be between 4.5% and 5% on a consolidated basis. This includes projected U.S. organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.5% for the full year.  As I just mentioned the change to our U.S. expectations is driven by our adjusted timing assumptions around T-Mobile\u2019s activity ramp up with us rather than a fundamental change in underlying long-term trends. For our International segment, we are reaffirming our outlook for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5%.  Moving on to Slide 11, you will see that we now expect our full year adjusted EBITDA to be $4,930 million, which is $40 million below the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects nearly 8% growth over the prior year on an FX neutral basis.  The drivers of this reduction in outlook are, a roughly $75 million increase to our bad debt reserves, primarily in India, and approximately $17 million reduction in net straight-line, and a $10 million reduction from our services segment which is the result of the revised outlook for T-Mobile activity.  These negative impacts are expected to be partially offset by a favorable FX translational impact of $20 million, as well as an additional $42 million or so of general outperformance we now anticipate throughout our business, particularly on the direct expenses and SG&A side.  As part of our adjusted EBITDA projections, we now expect cash SG&A as a percent of total property for the year to be in the high 8% range or around 7.4% excluding bad debt.  Lastly, we now expect consolidated AFFO for the full year to be $3,670 million, which is $20 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects nearly 9% growth over the prior year on an FX neutral basis.  We have been able to offset the expected decline in cash adjusted EBITDA through, $25 million and lower net cash interest, $10 million in lower cash taxes, $10 million in reduced maintenance capital expenditures and about $20 million in FX favorability. On a per share basis, we expect to generate consolidated AFFO of $8.23, up $0.05 relative to our prior guidance.  Moving on to Slide 12, let\u2019s review our capital deployment expectations for the year. Our full year dividend subject to the Board approval is expected to be approximately $2 billion resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20% once again.  As previously discussed, in future years, you could expect our dividend to grow roughly in line with our REIT taxable income. That will be consistent with our REIT requirements, as well as with our internally held dividend philosophy and is likely to result in growth rates dipping below 20% beginning next year.  Subject to Board discretion, we anticipate the impact of any deceleration in the growth rate to be gradual and expect our dividend to grow between 15% and 20% for each of the next several years.  We also expect to deploy nearly $1.1 billion towards our CapEx program with more than 85% of that investment being discretionary. This is down $25 million from our prior outlook with $15 million in lower redevelopment CapEx and an additional $10 million decline in maintenance CapEx.  We have spent roughly $757 million on M&A so far this year including our acquisition of MTN\u2019s minority stakes in our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda earlier this year and our entry into Poland through a small transaction in late June.  The purchase of TATA\u2019s remaining interest in our India business, which at current exchange rates had an approximate value of $329 million is currently pending regulatory approval in India. We continue to expect to complete the purchase of these shares this year. We also deployed around $56 million through share repurchases earlier in the year.  This combined with our year-to-date dividend declaration of $967 million brings our total capital returned to shareholders so far this year to over $1 billion.  Finally, as a step towards ensuring we have access to a wide variety of options for raising capital, we intend to implement an aftermarket stock offering program. We anticipate having the ability to from time-to-time sell up to $1 billion of our common stock. It\u2019s our intention to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include investment opportunities or debt repayments among other things.  Turning now to Slide 13, I will briefly discuss our investment philosophy, historical capital allocation and the associated financial returns. Since 2010, we have deployed nearly $46 billion through a combination of common stock dividend, our internal capital investment program, M&A transactions and common stock repurchases.  As you can see on the capital deployment chart to the left, approximately $27 billion was invested in M&A. Over $10 billion was returned to our common stockholders through the combination of dividend distributions and share repurchases. Roughly, $7 billion represented discretionary capital investments and with the remaining $1 billion being dedicated to non-discretionary maintenance capital projects. As Tom alluded to earlier, the vast majority of investments to-date have been geared towards macro towers. This has been guided by our longstanding investment objectives, which have always been and continue to be focused on generating maximum total shareholder returns by driving long-term AFFO per share growth and attractive return on invested capital, all while prudently managing risk.  Based on our significant experience and our constant review of all types of communications infrastructure, we view macro towers, whether in the United States or in select international markets as the most compelling assets for us to own as we pursue our investment objectives.  Likewise, as we explore innovation initiatives as a means of extending our platform of communications real estate our longstanding investment objectives and our disciplined approach will remain the same. As you can see, from our historical results, our investment process has worked well for our shareholders.  A key element of our success has been that our tower portfolios, regardless of where they are located shares several value-creating characteristics including the ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption, significant and proven operating leverage driven by contractual escalators, new business commencements and a high likelihood of multi-tenancy and very low ongoing capital maintenance.  Lastly, the high quality nature of our model is highlighted in our consistent and attractive financial returns. In the last decade, we have added more than 153,000 sites, many of which were less mature towers located outside the United States and came with lower, day one tenancy and margin profiles.  Even taking this into account, as you can see on the charts in the right, our return on invested capital has risen by around 50 basis points over the last ten years and stands now at nearly 11%. We view this as a testament to our disciplined investment approach and the powerful operating leverage inherent in the tower model.  We can now turn to Slide 14 and I\u2019ll make a few closing remarks. First, we finished the second quarter with a solid set of results and believe we are well positioned as we head into the second half of 2020 and beyond. Pro forma for refinancing activity earlier this month, we have over $5 billion in total liquidity with an average tenor of more than six years and an average interest cost of under 3%.  This position reflects our early redemption of all of our 2020 and 2021 senior notes, which leaves us with no senior note maturities until 2022. As Tom and I both discussed, outside of translational FX effects, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business thus far have been modest. We are pleased to see our global infrastructure assets play such a critical role in keeping people connected through this difficult time.  And in closing, I will make two final points. First, we are energized about the United States as we look out over a multi-year period. We expect the new wireless landscape to drive higher levels of network deployment activity as C-band spectrum becomes available. DISH begins rolling out their network and 5G activity across the industry lands up.  And second, our international markets also show great promise as our primarily large multinational tenants continue to invest heavily in their networks including around $30 billion expected in 2020. Networks across the globe are seeing tremendous growth in mobile data usage as consumers gain access to advance handsets than applications and we expect a long cycle of carrier capital spending to support these trends.  From our advantage point today, we continue to be excited about the future of wireless communications and the central role our real estate will play.  With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam [Ph]. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hey guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just two if I could. First on the U.S., if you can give us any additional color on what you are seeing in your discussions with the new T-Mobile, whether this delay is really timing-related or have there been any changes in terms of spending plan on them relative to earlier expectations?  And then just secondly, on the ATM program, can you help us think about the investment opportunities you are evaluating and the decision to use equity as a percent of means of funding this relative to the debt you\u2019ve traditionally used given where your leverage is today? Thanks. \nTom Bartlett: Hey Matt. How are you? This is Tom. On the T-Mobile side, based upon everything that I think they said publicly, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it really is just timing. And they are working through all their plans. They closed their deal in April then settled their transaction with DISH, not that long ago. So, we believe it clearly is timing. And are looking forward to really supporting them as they continue to really build out their network even further.  On the ATM side, it\u2019s good plumbing. It really is just having more flexibility. It\u2019s not a significant number clearly, compared to general ATM programs as part of market cap. So it really is just kind of good plumbing to have a flexibility of having access to a number of different sources of capital. \nRod Smith: And if I can, Matt, maybe I would add\u2026 \nUnidentified Analyst : And just a follow-up \u2013 go ahead, Rod. \nRod Smith: I am sorry, Matt. Yes, let me just add a couple of points on the U.S. growth. Number one is, everyone kind of saw the slowdown from T-Mobile as the sorts of middle to third quarter of last year.  Now that we are almost lapping that slowdown and that\u2019s where the further way from the beginning of that slowdown, the bigger impact that it has on the organic tenant billings growth deceleration. So, the fact that they haven\u2019t started up yet is, what\u2019s causing us to reduce our outlook from about 5% down to about 4.5%.  And the other expectations in the U.S. industry remain the same. So, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in our expectations relative to the other carriers or anything else going on in the U.S. it really is isolated to the new T-Mobile and the timing of when they begin to spend. \nUnidentified Analyst : And that was going to be my follow-up. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nRod Smith: Okay. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. And just to follow-up on the U.S. activity, can you provide an update on how you think about the potential decommissioning that T-Mobile can do? I think the Sprint sides are \u2013 upward maybe next year.  And second question on LATAM. How do you think about the growth going forward given that the macro environment is weaker and with the potential acquisition of other carriers could potentially create some churn activity. Yes. I would like to see your thoughts on how you think that could impact your growth over the next few years. Thank you. \nTom Bartlett: Yes, Batiya [Ph] it\u2019s Tom. With regard to \u2013 I\u2019ll address the LATAM question first, I mean we are really excited about the opportunities that we continue to see down in the market, particularly in a market like Brazil which is still so underserved. I mean, if you take a look at customers per site, it\u2019s significantly higher than what we are seeing in the United States.  And so, we continue to see a \u2013 the opportunities for further densification where our build programs are continuing to grow. So we are actually very energized and our teams in the markets are very excited about the opportunities there. Yes, there is some consolidation perhaps going on in the market, but that was fully understood, fully expected. So there really no surprises there.  And I think the government themselves, particularly with regards to what we are seeing in the pandemic continue to want to drive a connectivity and digital connectivity in their markets. So, we are quite excited about that. And as you all know it represents a relatively small piece of revenues. I am sorry Batiya, [Ph] second question on the U.S. side, was? \nUnidentified Analyst : On the T-Mobile decommissioning activity that could start potentially next year? ... with last year. So we think that, that's a good...\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No. You are right. I mean, those \u2013 a vast majority of those sites come up for renewal towards the end of next year.  We believe they are obviously well positioned sites and we will likely try to mitigate as much of that churn potential as possible and hopeful that between the new build it\u2019s going on in the marketplace as well as, DISH's expectations for building out, they will be successful in terms of mitigating that. But that\u2019s all part of the lot of the negotiations and discussions that are going on as we speak. \nUnidentified Analyst : Alright. Thank you. \nRod Smith: And Batia [Ph] I will just a couple of comments on the Sprint T-Mobile, maybe I put the merger kind of in context with the U.S. market. So, you know, that the U.S. is experiencing kind of exploding growth in mobile data, about 30% a year increases. We\u2019ve seen accelerating deployments for 5G kind of heading our way that the number of new spectrums heading into the market that will have to be built out.  The carriers continue to invest heavily in 4G as they focus on their customer experience and strengthen their networks to handle the growing data demand. So all that is, really constructive in terms of what\u2019s happening in the U.S. landscape. When you look at T-Mobile in particular, they have come with pretty significant build-out requirements.  So they said that they are going to spend $40 billion over the first three years, build an additional 10 to 15 sites, particularly in some of the rural areas where they are expected to cover 97% of the population on low-band spectrum of about 75%, on mid-band spectrum within three years. So, they\u2019ve got an awful lot of work to do. They are certainly going to be deploying capital.  So we continue to believe that it\u2019s in their best interest and good for our shareholders, as well to the extent that we can enter into an arrangement where they can have quick access to our site and potentially renegotiating the way some of the churn happens over time. So to spread that potential churn, which is we continue to believe it\u2019s in the range of 3% to 4% of our overall property revenue.  That\u2019s the overlap piece. And we continue to expect that could be spread out over time and we could give T-Mobile easy quick access to our sites through a holistic deal which will help them deploy their network. \nUnidentified Analyst : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Atkin: Yes. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Brazil and kind of the directionality of the organic growth rates. You talked about OI, but maybe Nextel and that consolidation, does that represent perhaps a little bit of a headwind or not big enough to matter? And then, I just wondered a little bit about India.  You talked a little bit about the bad debt provision, but if you talk about just actual leasing activity in the market any changes that to kind of call out over the next couple of quarters versus what you\u2019ve seen. Thanks. \nTom Bartlett: Yes. I mean, Jon, first on Brazil, just kind of getting a little bit deeper into the market, it\u2019s a market that we expect the wireless CapEx is going to be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. So, obviously, very, very strong, a high growth market for us. The CapEx percent of carrier revenue is to be around 25%, which is actually a bit higher than we\u2019ve seen in prior years consistent with last year.  So we think that that\u2019s a good sign. Their margins are in the 40%. So the carriers themselves, I think are quite well capitalized and very focused on building out their 4G overall initiatives. The local CPI is actually been down over the last several years, so was our escalators in concert with it. And that\u2019s being really reflected in some of the 2020 escalator that we are seeing this year.  But Vivo, Tim, America Movil, including Nextel, in that transaction is relatively insignificant relative to our overall growth rates. And we are seeing organic tenant billings growth of over 8% in Q2, churn was in the kind of the mid 1% to 1.7% for the year. And we expect for the year overall, billings growth is 7%. So, we are bullish on the marketplace. We think we are well positioned.  We have really solid relationships with what we expect to be kind of the three main players in the marketplace. And as I mentioned before, we believe that the networks are overburdened. They have roughly 3000 to 4000 sims for sell-side. It\u2019s really twice what we are seeing in the U.S. So, the teams are excited or bullish. We are building out sites. We have a lot of interesting things, I think, going on with the various carriers. And so, we are excited about what we expect in the marketplace.  On the India side, again, if you take a look at the kind of the total growth that we\u2019ve seen in the market, and again it\u2019s double-digits on a total gross basis. Carrier spending continues to be strong, building out their networks. They continue to make the network investments to support the overall usage demands. I mean, I think I mentioned in some of my comments that, we really remain optimistic about the market.  The structure is now much more rational. There is price competition and wireless has actually stabilized and the regulatory environment is very, very constructive. There is a significant appetite for mobile data from a customer perspective. They are using over 10 gig per month and that was even before the COVID-19 impact.  So, as well as they are still using the significant legacy technologies, 2G technologies, rather than even 4G. So we think is that the network continues to get equipped as the government continues to expand its overall Digital India strategy that there is going to be a significant amount of further densification and network investment going on in the marketplace. \nJonathan Atkin: And then, lastly on the U.S., yes, and on U.S. you talked Sprint T-Mobile at some lengths done, what about the rest of the industry? There is two other national carriers and if you think about in aggregate kind of their activity level and do you think that you are expecting there that will be different compared to year-to-date trends? \nTom Bartlett: No. I mean, they have been very interested. I mean, very, very steady in terms of their build out. You\u2019ve heard them kind of tweak what they expect their overall CapEx expectations are probably for the year. But for us, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We are expecting to be so. \nJonathan Atkin: Thank you very much. \nTom Bartlett: Sure, Jon. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri. Please go ahead. \nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to take a step back to India and just talk about \u2013 I was hoping you could give us some of your views on U.S. hyperscalers, really kind of starting to navigate that region and how that actually changes anything. And then maybe perhaps just thinking about your international strategy and what you\u2019ve observed in India and how that could potentially happen in other markets?  Does this at all change your international M&A strategy, your expansion strategy at all? Are there regions that you are going to start avoiding simply because you don\u2019t want to get tangled up in these kinds of speed bumps along the road and just want to get your take kind of on those different dynamics there?\nTom Bartlett: I think that the fact that we are seeing another \u2013 number of hyperscalers investing in India is a very good thing. There are significant investments being made into the networks. They see the same things that we do in terms of the kind of the digital transformation that\u2019s going on in the marketplace and they are bringing many more applications and products to the consumers to those particular markets.  And given that the wire line penetration is very, very low in that market, as well as most of the markets that we are in outside of the United States. We think that then most of that traffic to be able to utilize those applications is going to go over those wireless networks and clearly the carriers are going to want to invest in their networks to be able to support it.  It\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve seen here in the United States. And so, I think it\u2019s a very good sign candidly. And I would hope that we would continue to see more of that kind of activity being in \u2013 occurring in the markets outside where we have a presence. \nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for that color. And then, just take me back to the U.S., and on prior earnings calls, you\u2019ve talked about the micro datacenter opportunity and probably within the last twelve months if opportunity has quickly evolved from proof-of-concepts in 2019 and now fully funded, we see competitors and you guys have now kind of drawn the lines of the sand coming to the table. So if you could give us an update on the micro datacenter opportunity within the U.S.?\nTom Bartlett: Well, I mean, the underlying premise clearly is that, we believe the cloud is moving to the edge and we see this. There are a number of factors that are supporting it, whether if you are looking at CRAN, you are looking at what\u2019s going on with cloud infrastructure and with the deployment of 5G, we think that enterprise customers are going to be looking for low latency access as well as cloud, kinds of capabilities out of the edge. And so, we remain very bullish on the whole opportunity.  We do have a number of trial sites. I think we have five or six trial sites down in the Southeast and actually out in west. And the way we are looking at it really is that, at this point in time, there are really kind of a couple of distinct trends that we are paying attention to. First of all, on the distributed compute and then more broadly on the mobilized computing where we think that the TAM is going to be significantly higher and that we will be able to create some scale.  And we've talked about the distributed compute, which is really where we are focused right now with regards to a number of our kind of trial sites. And that\u2019s where enterprise workloads moving to the public cloud and there is a growing near-term market segment use for on and off for private cloud computing in somewhat of a hybrid solution.  And so, when in many of the sites that we have, we have 50 kilowatts of power and we are providing kind of local compute capability for mid and smaller sized enterprises. And so, it\u2019s an interesting market segment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually being serviced, particularly well today. But clearly, that\u2019s not the big opportunity that we see going forward.  The big opportunity is clearly on the mobile edge compute. And it\u2019s one where we think that we are actually going to be able to further scale. But we are really just in the early innings of it. But the concept of the strategy is that we expect we\u2019ll be able to build a neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud datacenter in several thousand of our sites that we have across the country.  And we do have a meet-me room/data center in Atlanta, which is, as I said tied to a major datacenter down in the marketplace. And so, we are tracking in the opportunity and what it will mean to be able to really develop this type of a strategy. We realize that we don\u2019t have lots of the skill sets that are going to be required to really scale this.  And so, like our other kind of innovative initiatives, very potentially we\u2019ll look to partner to be able to gain access to those kinds of skill sets and capabilities, distribution, software engineers, those types of things to really be able to scale and grow the opportunity. So, early innings as I said, but we remain quite bullish on the overall opportunity. \nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss. Please go ahead. \nRic Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning guys. Everybody, hope you and your family and employees are doing okay through this COVID-19 time. \nTom Bartlett: And you, as well. \nRod Smith: Yes. Thanks, Rick.\nRic Prentiss : Yes. Wanted to touch on the Sprint decommissioning question again. Obviously, T-Mobile has a lot of dominos they are trying to knock down in the process. But it sounded like, to Batiya\u2019s question, you guys might be more interested in spreading the effects of the churn through holistic over time versus maybe taking a one-time payment like you did with TATA?\nTom Bartlett: Ric, it will come down to math. Right, it\u2019s really a TBD type of an event. We expect really based upon what T-Mobile has said is that, they are going to need thousands of sites over and above what they are expecting right now after the decommissioning, right? And so, there could be an opportunity for those sites. There could be an opportunity for those sites in the hands of somebody else.  And so, it\u2019s a bit of three dimensional chess right now in terms of what these transactions with all of our customers and potential customers. I would expect that there will be churn of some sort. I don\u2019t know it will be all at once or over an extended period of time. But we believe that longer-term, there are clearly going to be a number of offsets and if you just take a look at the wireless growth that we are seeing in the marketplace.  And what we\u2019d expect and the amount of capital that all these carriers are looking to spend and the fact that this is going to be coming into the full there, we would expect solid growth going forward. But, so it\u2019s really a TBD at this point. I would want to give you a sense of that anything is certain, or anything is put in concrete we continue to work all those items with our customers. \nRic Prentiss : Right. So it\u2019s all mass negotiations, see how it plays out. Okay. \nTom Bartlett: Right. \nRic Prentiss : You mentioned there is a couple of times that obviously, we are all monitoring this very closely, there is a feeling that this needs a lot more funding to really get the network ramp going. It was a good sign to see Dave Mayo join I think, DISH as Network Deployment Head, but how are you thinking about when DISH might be starting to show up in the process as you look into 2021, 2022, 2023, how \u2013 given the funding is not there yet. \nTom Bartlett: Well, I mean, they also have network requirements that they need to adhere to. And I think that the 2023 I think is the first commitment that they\u2019ve made. So, I would expect to see them hit market in 2021. I think that's a better question for T-Mobile. I mean, I think it is a good sign. They brought in Dave Mayo. I think he'll do a terrific job there. And time will tell in terms of what it looks like.  But we are there to service them and support them in any way that they feel necessary and we think that we've got a portfolio of assets that really can be helpful to them. And I think they appreciate that as well. So, but I would expect that we\u2019ll start to see them towards the end of this year into 2021. They are not in our forecast.  They are not in our guidance until we really have a more formal arrangement with them and understand what their demands are going to be, we won\u2019t put them into our forecast. \nRic Prentiss : Okay. And apologize you might have already answered this, I was on a call this morning. On the AFFO guidance, Slide 11, you talked about a $45 million benefit to AFFO guidance from other components. Could you unpack that what\u2019s in that $45 million that obviously offsets the $45 million negative on cash EBITDA? \nTom Bartlett: Yes, I mean, it\u2019s interest. It\u2019s maintenance CapEx. It\u2019s cash access. It\u2019s kind of the typical group of items below EBITDA that impact AFFO that we are seeing some positive benefits from. \nRic Prentiss : Okay. And last one for me, the CBRS auction is obviously going on right now. What are your thoughts about what that means, particularly maybe to the indoor states and what the opportunity for you guys? \nTom Bartlett: We continue to be very positive on the indoor spot, our indoor space. We think that the unlicensed here access spectrum in the U.S. that\u2019s a potential to really transform, if you will the overall indoor connectivity landscape. It improves the overall TAM clearly, and it reduces the overall total ownership cost. And so, we are very positive - we have the number of trials going on, Ric, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past.  But again, it\u2019s early innings right now in terms of what that opportunity is. We have 400 DAS locations, if you will, around the country with a TAM of probably a couple thousand. But we think that given the cost components of being able to open up, feed the network, exactly TAMs would increase ten-fold.  And so, what we are seeing, what that looks like, we are taking a look at what those relationships are going to look like then with the landlords across the country. But we are energized by what we think we might be able to \u2013 and how we might be able to position ourselves. \nRic Prentiss : Thanks much. \nRod Smith : And Ric, I\u2019ll just give you a couple of numbers there to back up what Tom was saying about the AFFO. So, the $45 million offsets are broken down with $10 million on lower maintenance CapEx. $25 million in lower net cash interest and $10 million in lower cash taxes. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Barden, Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I think in the opening comments, you mentioned that you saw that CPI did bring in some of the international markets affecting the organic growth. I was wondering if you could kind of put some numbers around that. And then, sort of another situation unfolding in Latin America is the Telefonica RAN sharing agreement with AT&T.  I think that there is just been a lack of certainty around what that will ultimately look like and you guys have talked about having some engagement there to maybe try to create a holistic relationship down there. Could you kind of update us on any progress on that front? Thanks a lot. \nTom Bartlett: Yes. Sure, Dave. I think on the CPI side, the escalator, I think in the quarter was roughly 3.7% and that really, again the way they work, it works off with the 2019 kind of the inflation number is which drive what the escalator would be. So our escalator is down. And if you think about, even looking at Brazil for example, the growth rates in Brazil, my sense, we are up in the kind of even the 10% range in the last couple of years if I recall.  And we are now down in kind of that 7%, 8% range. And so, it has a significant impact, if you will kind of going forward. And as you know it\u2019s very volatile on a year-to-year basis, but it can impact the overall organic growth rate by a couple 100 basis points one way or another.  With regards to Mexico, a fair question in terms of Telefonica and their interest in the marketplace. We have a terrific relationship with AT&T in the market and we are working closely with both Telefonica and AT&T right now on that transition and what that might look like over the next several years. And so, it\u2019s a TBD. We are in the middle of it. And as I said, I think we are really well positioned to be able to support both our customers as they transition their network. \nDavid Barden: Great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan. Please go ahead. \nTim Horan : Thanks. Tom, regarding the \u2013 do you think there is an opportunity longer term for you guys to deploy more equipment as we kind of virtualize the networks more and the carriers can kind of share the equipment, particularly the cable companies are kind of entering the market are going to want capacity, but maybe not trying to deploy their own equipment.  I know you've done some of this in past and well in each segments, but just any thoughts around that? \nTom Bartlett: Tim, are you talking about O-RAN or?\nTim Horan : Yes, yes. \nTom Bartlett: Yes. It\u2019s very interesting. I mean, I do think the whole O-RAN opportunity which we\u2019ve seen in other markets, by the way, we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world is definitely starting to take hold here in the United States and ultimately we could see even the large carriers looking to take certain segments of their spectrum, certain segments of their technology and really opening it up. It kind of ties to my thoughts before in terms of kind of that cloud even becoming closer and closer to the edge.  Now, keep in mind that, that\u2019s kind of what happens behind the curtain. So, that\u2019s happening back on the RAN side away from the impact on the towercos. So, my intent is that any opportunity for the carriers, wireless carriers and potential new players in the marketplace to be able to bring down their total cost of ownership will then allow them to have more capital available to spend on the RAN, which is really where we come in, right?  And so, we don\u2019t expect any of the kind of the O-RAN implications to impact at all what\u2019s happening from the site out to the device. And as I said, it\u2019s in fact the total cost of ownership comes down as a result of the kind of the open nature of the infrastructure that might allow more capital to be able to spent on where we come in, which is from the tower out to the device.  And so, we are cautiously optimistic on the opportunity for O-RAN in the United State, as well as many of our international markets. \nTim Horan : And kind of related on the technology front, do you think carriers are still favoring macros over small cells or if you are talking to the carriers, how are they feeling on small cell deployments at this point over the next couple of years? \nTom Bartlett: It all comes down to band, it all comes down to densification. We don\u2019t see any change. I mean, the economics are still clearly that the macro tower can be able to support much more efficiently their customer base.  Now there are going to be certain locations, there may be certain technologies, certain band that can be better utilized and supportive at a small cell than in those dense urban markets. But we don\u2019t see it any different right now. Those dense urban markets, the New York City kind of things, just because of interference, talking about high bands, just like what Verizon is doing today.  So, I don\u2019t expect really any change to that. It\u2019s going to be a function of band. It\u2019s going to be a function of the densification of the markets that they are trying to serve, really the topography of what they are trying to serve. But we don\u2019t see any change at all and they use the small cells versus macro. \nTim Horan : Thank you. \nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Please go ahead. \nColby Synesael : Great. Two if I may. There has been some press reports of late that Vodafone Idea may have skipped out on its June payments to lease some of the tower operators and I am curious if you are one of those, or if everything you are doing is, I think, just cautionary and being trying to get ahead of that.  And to the extent that they haven\u2019t actually made their June or perhaps July payment, do you think that, that's going to last until the AGR situation is settled? Or is this maybe just a month or two?  And then secondly, I am just curious, what do you think your exit velocity is in terms of U.S. organic growth in the fourth quarter of this year? And what does that really imply, I guess, for potential growth in 2021?  And I am sure you can appreciate a lot of investors are trying to get a sense of what is that magnitude of acceleration we could potentially think. And when we start to balance that out from the comments, Rod that you mentioned about trying to flatten out the churn. Just trying to start to frame out how to think about what that could look like? I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give guidance, but clearly a big focus for investors. \nTom Bartlett: Yes, So, Colby, let me try to address a couple and Rod can add a few comments as well. On the whole, Vodafone India situation, I mean, I don\u2019t want to get into specifics there. I think if you step back and if you take a look at where the government is, I mean the government has definitely advocated for having three strong players in the marketplace.  They are currently working through as the other carriers are with the Supreme Court in terms of where that final AGR issue is going to land. We are hopeful that there will be some resolution to this even over the next 30 to 45 days or so. There is a hearing I think in mid-August for the carriers that are no longer and providing service.  But we hope that that will provide some guidance for how the payments \u2013 the extended payments will be made \u2013 have to be made by the carriers themselves. I mean, they\u2019ve made some sizable good base installments, as best I can tell in terms of what is owed in the marketplace. And they are aggressively trying to restructure to save cost and compete in the marketplace. And so, yes, I mean, there is some slow paying going on in the marketplace. We are working very closely with them as we would be working with any customer who is going through a similar situation. So more to come. You saw what some of our expectations were relative to how we looked at outlook for the balance of the year. But kind of given the direction of the government, given what we are seeing in the marketplace, again we remain optimistic and cautiously optimistic about their ability to continue and to grow.  I am sorry, Colby your question on the U.S. side was, the exit rate. It will largely be a \u2013 candidly a function of the kind of growth that we are going to be seeing later in the year by the various carriers in terms of their overall investments in their network. You heard Rod talked about that we are talking about an overall growth rate based upon what we are seeing right now and kind of that 4.5-ish range. So, it\u2019s down a little bit, again, largely tied \u2013 almost exclusively tied to the timing of T-Mobile. So, we are optimistic that T-Mobile will pickup pace and we\u2019ll see that increase in activity. And I think that will bode well foregoing into 2021. And the whole notion of the churn relative to Sprint, as we talked about before, that's a TBD in terms of where does the math sets aligned for us and where can we best service our customers in terms of whether that will be over an extended period of time or whether that would be taken more upfront. So, more to come on that one. \nRod Smith : And Colby, maybe I\u2019ll just add a couple of comments on the accounts receivable issue. Not specific to Vodafone, but Tom covered that up. But just to put it into context, Q1 rolling into Q2, our accounts receivable has been very stable. So we didn\u2019t see any increase in our overall accounts receivable across the globe. Our DSO numbers are still in the mid to upper 30s. That\u2019s consistent Q2 over Q1.  So we\u2019ve been very pleased that not only in India, but also in terms of the COVID-19 impacts around the globe, we\u2019ve had very stable accounts receivable balances from Q1 to Q2 where our net receivables on the books at the end of Q1 was about $620 million. It's actually about $585 million at the end of Q2. With that said, you will see in our numbers that we took a bad debt reserve charge in Q2 of about $25 million.  And then, we also built into the back half of the forecast an additional $75 million. Those are both reserves at this point. So, we do expect that much of that will be collected. It just may \u2013 it may take us a little bit longer. So, we are trying to be cautious for the back half of the year. I\u2019d also let you know that we have the balances in our accounts receivable ledger that are over 90 days are 100% reserves coming out of Q2.  So, again, we look that as a pretty comfortable position. Maybe it\u2019s conservative position. Their reserves are not actually bad debt write-offs yet. So we do expect to collect a lot of that. It\u2019s just a matter of when. And of course, Vodafone is tied to AGR and we'll see how that gets resolved here soon. \nColby Synesael : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: And there are no further questions. \nTom Bartlett: Thanks everybody for joining. Have a great day and stay healthy and safe. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. I hope you are safe and healthy. As you saw in today's press release, we had another solid quarter throughout our global business, driven by consistent demand for our mission-critical tower assets.  Before we turn to the accompanying charts, I would like to highlight a few specific accomplishments for the quarter. First, we met our revenue. Adjusted EBITDA consolidated AFFO expectations which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Second, we had solid organic tenant billings growth across our business led by Africa at nearly 10% and Latin America at over 7%. Third, we constructed more than 500 towers across our international footprint. And finally, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet by issuing $2 billion in senior unsecured notes across multiple tenors with very attractive economics.  Now, let\u2019s turn to the details of our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8 and we will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. Although we experienced some unfavorable FX translational impact, primarily resulting from the global pandemic, overall, we generated solid underlying revenue growth.  In the interest of understanding our fundamental operational performance, I\u2019ll be referring to growth rates for some of our key metrics on an FX neutral basis in addition to our standard as-reported basis.  As Igor mentioned earlier, our second quarter consolidated property revenue of nearly $1,900 million grew on a reported basis by $44 million or 2.4% over the prior year period. And on an FX neutral basis by $158 million or 8.6%.  Our U.S. segment represented 57% of our consolidated property revenue with international comprising the remaining 43%. A key contributor to our consolidated property revenue was our tenant billings revenue of $1,620 million, which grew by nearly 10%. The components of our tenant billings growth included around $71 million in colocation and amendments.  Roughly $50 million in contributions from escalators and $72 million in day one tenant billings from acquisitions and new builds. These positive items were partially offset by churn impacts of $46 million and $2 million in other items.  Our U.S. property segment revenue totaled nearly $1,100 million for the quarter and grew by $80 million or 8% over the prior year period. Our international property revenue of nearly $806 million declined by $36 million or 4.3% as compared to last year\u2019s levels, primarily due to the FX translational headwinds we just discussed.  Moving to the right-side of the slide, you will see that our consolidated organic tenant billings growth was in line with our expectations at 5% for the quarter. For our U.S. property segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.7% comprised of new business activity which contributed 3.7%, escalators, which contributed 3.2%, churn of 1.9% and a roughly 30 basis points negative impact from other items.  As expected, this growth rate reflects a sequential deceleration driven primarily by relatively modest contributions to our new business from T-Mobile over the last few quarters.  With that said, and as I will discuss in more detail when we review our updated outlook, we have seen new business activity from T-Mobile begin to pickup with further acceleration anticipated towards the end of the year.  Our international property segment organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, led by Africa at nearly 10% and Latin America at over 7%. Europe was just over 2%, while India was 0.4%, again, in line with our expectations given anticipated churn and general market conditions.  The component parts of international organic tenant billings growth where new business activity which totaled nearly 7% are mostly local inflation-based pricing escalators which contributed 3.7% and other items which contributed around 20 basis points. These items were partially offset by churn of 5.3%, much of which was in India.  Now, please turn to Slide 9 and we will review our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO results. Our second quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1.2 billion grew on a reported basis by about $28 million or 2.4% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by $19 million or 7.6%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.3%, up roughly 70 basis points over the prior year.  This increase was attributable to a combination of our solid organic growth, diligent focus on cost controls, and a favorable impact of some incremental net straight-line. These favorable impacts were partially offset by approximately $21 million in bad debt reserves, against certain receivables in India.  Although we operate in 20 countries, our U.S. business again drove the substantial majority of our property segment operating profit in the quarter accounting for 68% of the total, while our international business generated the remaining 32%.  Moving to the right-side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $924 million grew on a reported basis by nearly $15 million or 1.6% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by around $69 million or 7.5%.  Consolidated AFFO per share of $2.07grew on a reported basis by $0.03 or 1.5% over last year\u2019s levels and on an FX neutral basis grew by $0.15 or 7.4%. This growth in AFFO and AFFO per share was driven by our previously discussed growth in adjusted EBITDA, as well as interest expense management, careful oversight of cash taxes and lower maintenance capital spending.  Let\u2019s now take a look at our updated expectations for 2020. Before I get into the numbers, I want to cover a few of our high-level assumptions. First is our updated expectation regarding the post-merger acceleration in new business activity from T-Mobile. Our prior outlook assumed activity levels would have materially increased by now and that we would be seeing increased levels of new business from T-Mobile starting this month.  Although, we have seen a modest increase in activity, it has not yet reached the level we expect to eventually see, based on the T-Mobile\u2019s public comments. As a result, we now expect this acceleration of new business to come much later this year. Consequently, we are reducing our U.S. organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2020, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Next is our updated expectations regarding customer collections and additional reserves for some bad debt. For the most part, tenants throughout our footprint have continued to pay on-time and without interruption through the pandemic.  However, in India, we have layered in approximately $65 million in additional bad debt assumptions for the full year. This is primarily attributable to the expected timing of payments from the government owned carrier BSNL, as well as the possibility that Vodafone Idea future payments become interrupted or delayed as they weigh a final outcome of the ongoing AGR court proceedings in India.  Additionally, we have assumed roughly $10 million in incremental bad debt reserves for a few tenants in Africa.  Lastly, we have updated the foreign currency exchange rates in our full year outlook. The impacts of these revised FX rates on full year expectations, as compared to our prior guidance are estimated to be a positive $45 million of property revenue, $20 million for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO.  Aside from these adjustments, our other high-level assumptions remain largely consistent with our prior view as demand for our telecommunications real estate across all of our markets is expected to remain solid.  If you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 10, I will now review our revised outlook midpoints. Our updated guidance for property revenue is $7,720 million, which is a decrease of $30 million compared to the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects a growth rate on a reported basis of 3.4%. On an FX neutral basis, the growth rate is approximately 8%.  For our U.S. segment, we now expect property revenue of $4,380 million, which is $35 million lower than our prior projections. About $20 million of this decrease is attributable to the timing of T-Mobile activity with the remaining $15 million or so being driven by an adjustment in our non-cash straight-line revenue expectations as a result of an accounting true-up.  For our International segment, we now anticipate property revenue of $3,340 million, which is $5 million higher than our prior expectation. This is being driven by roughly $45 million in favorable FX impacts, along with around $10 million in other outperformance, partially offset by a $50 million currency neutral decline in pass-through revenues across our footprint due to lower fuel prices.  At a high level, our expectations for our international businesses are broadly consistent with our prior outlook, which demonstrates the critical nature of our assets, as well as the effectiveness of our more than 5,000 employees across the globe. We could not be more proud of the way our global teams have performed throughout this pandemic.  Moving on to the right-side of the slide, we now expect organic tenant billings growth to be between 4.5% and 5% on a consolidated basis. This includes projected U.S. organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.5% for the full year.  As I just mentioned the change to our U.S. expectations is driven by our adjusted timing assumptions around T-Mobile\u2019s activity ramp up with us rather than a fundamental change in underlying long-term trends. For our International segment, we are reaffirming our outlook for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5%.  Moving on to Slide 11, you will see that we now expect our full year adjusted EBITDA to be $4,930 million, which is $40 million below the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects nearly 8% growth over the prior year on an FX neutral basis.  The drivers of this reduction in outlook are, a roughly $75 million increase to our bad debt reserves, primarily in India, and approximately $17 million reduction in net straight-line, and a $10 million reduction from our services segment which is the result of the revised outlook for T-Mobile activity.  These negative impacts are expected to be partially offset by a favorable FX translational impact of $20 million, as well as an additional $42 million or so of general outperformance we now anticipate throughout our business, particularly on the direct expenses and SG&A side.  As part of our adjusted EBITDA projections, we now expect cash SG&A as a percent of total property for the year to be in the high 8% range or around 7.4% excluding bad debt.  Lastly, we now expect consolidated AFFO for the full year to be $3,670 million, which is $20 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects nearly 9% growth over the prior year on an FX neutral basis.  We have been able to offset the expected decline in cash adjusted EBITDA through, $25 million and lower net cash interest, $10 million in lower cash taxes, $10 million in reduced maintenance capital expenditures and about $20 million in FX favorability. On a per share basis, we expect to generate consolidated AFFO of $8.23, up $0.05 relative to our prior guidance.  Moving on to Slide 12, let\u2019s review our capital deployment expectations for the year. Our full year dividend subject to the Board approval is expected to be approximately $2 billion resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20% once again.  As previously discussed, in future years, you could expect our dividend to grow roughly in line with our REIT taxable income. That will be consistent with our REIT requirements, as well as with our internally held dividend philosophy and is likely to result in growth rates dipping below 20% beginning next year.  Subject to Board discretion, we anticipate the impact of any deceleration in the growth rate to be gradual and expect our dividend to grow between 15% and 20% for each of the next several years.  We also expect to deploy nearly $1.1 billion towards our CapEx program with more than 85% of that investment being discretionary. This is down $25 million from our prior outlook with $15 million in lower redevelopment CapEx and an additional $10 million decline in maintenance CapEx.  We have spent roughly $757 million on M&A so far this year including our acquisition of MTN\u2019s minority stakes in our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda earlier this year and our entry into Poland through a small transaction in late June.  The purchase of TATA\u2019s remaining interest in our India business, which at current exchange rates had an approximate value of $329 million is currently pending regulatory approval in India. We continue to expect to complete the purchase of these shares this year. We also deployed around $56 million through share repurchases earlier in the year.  This combined with our year-to-date dividend declaration of $967 million brings our total capital returned to shareholders so far this year to over $1 billion.  Finally, as a step towards ensuring we have access to a wide variety of options for raising capital, we intend to implement an aftermarket stock offering program. We anticipate having the ability to from time-to-time sell up to $1 billion of our common stock. It\u2019s our intention to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include investment opportunities or debt repayments among other things.  Turning now to Slide 13, I will briefly discuss our investment philosophy, historical capital allocation and the associated financial returns. Since 2010, we have deployed nearly $46 billion through a combination of common stock dividend, our internal capital investment program, M&A transactions and common stock repurchases.  As you can see on the capital deployment chart to the left, approximately $27 billion was invested in M&A. Over $10 billion was returned to our common stockholders through the combination of dividend distributions and share repurchases. Roughly, $7 billion represented discretionary capital investments and with the remaining $1 billion being dedicated to non-discretionary maintenance capital projects. As Tom alluded to earlier, the vast majority of investments to-date have been geared towards macro towers. This has been guided by our longstanding investment objectives, which have always been and continue to be focused on generating maximum total shareholder returns by driving long-term AFFO per share growth and attractive return on invested capital, all while prudently managing risk.  Based on our significant experience and our constant review of all types of communications infrastructure, we view macro towers, whether in the United States or in select international markets as the most compelling assets for us to own as we pursue our investment objectives.  Likewise, as we explore innovation initiatives as a means of extending our platform of communications real estate our longstanding investment objectives and our disciplined approach will remain the same. As you can see, from our historical results, our investment process has worked well for our shareholders.  A key element of our success has been that our tower portfolios, regardless of where they are located shares several value-creating characteristics including the ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption, significant and proven operating leverage driven by contractual escalators, new business commencements and a high likelihood of multi-tenancy and very low ongoing capital maintenance.  Lastly, the high quality nature of our model is highlighted in our consistent and attractive financial returns. In the last decade, we have added more than 153,000 sites, many of which were less mature towers located outside the United States and came with lower, day one tenancy and margin profiles.  Even taking this into account, as you can see on the charts in the right, our return on invested capital has risen by around 50 basis points over the last ten years and stands now at nearly 11%. We view this as a testament to our disciplined investment approach and the powerful operating leverage inherent in the tower model.  We can now turn to Slide 14 and I\u2019ll make a few closing remarks. First, we finished the second quarter with a solid set of results and believe we are well positioned as we head into the second half of 2020 and beyond. Pro forma for refinancing activity earlier this month, we have over $5 billion in total liquidity with an average tenor of more than six years and an average interest cost of under 3%.  This position reflects our early redemption of all of our 2020 and 2021 senior notes, which leaves us with no senior note maturities until 2022. As Tom and I both discussed, outside of translational FX effects, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business thus far have been modest. We are pleased to see our global infrastructure assets play such a critical role in keeping people connected through this difficult time.  And in closing, I will make two final points. First, we are energized about the United States as we look out over a multi-year period. We expect the new wireless landscape to drive higher levels of network deployment activity as C-band spectrum becomes available. DISH begins rolling out their network and 5G activity across the industry lands up.  And second, our international markets also show great promise as our primarily large multinational tenants continue to invest heavily in their networks including around $30 billion expected in 2020. Networks across the globe are seeing tremendous growth in mobile data usage as consumers gain access to advance handsets than applications and we expect a long cycle of carrier capital spending to support these trends.  From our advantage point today, we continue to be excited about the future of wireless communications and the central role our real estate will play.  With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions? And if I can, Matt, maybe I would add\u2026 I am sorry, Matt. Yes, let me just add a couple of points on the U.S. growth. Number one is, everyone kind of saw the slowdown from T-Mobile as the sorts of middle to third quarter of last year.  Now that we are almost lapping that slowdown and that\u2019s where the further way from the beginning of that slowdown, the bigger impact that it has on the organic tenant billings growth deceleration. So, the fact that they haven\u2019t started up yet is, what\u2019s causing us to reduce our outlook from about 5% down to about 4.5%.  And the other expectations in the U.S. industry remain the same. So, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in our expectations relative to the other carriers or anything else going on in the U.S. it really is isolated to the new T-Mobile and the timing of when they begin to spend. Okay. And Batia [Ph] I will just a couple of comments on the Sprint T-Mobile, maybe I put the merger kind of in context with the U.S. market. So, you know, that the U.S. is experiencing kind of exploding growth in mobile data, about 30% a year increases. We\u2019ve seen accelerating deployments for 5G kind of heading our way that the number of new spectrums heading into the market that will have to be built out.  The carriers continue to invest heavily in 4G as they focus on their customer experience and strengthen their networks to handle the growing data demand. So all that is, really constructive in terms of what\u2019s happening in the U.S. landscape. When you look at T-Mobile in particular, they have come with pretty significant build-out requirements.  So they said that they are going to spend $40 billion over the first three years, build an additional 10 to 15 sites, particularly in some of the rural areas where they are expected to cover 97% of the population on low-band spectrum of about 75%, on mid-band spectrum within three years. So, they\u2019ve got an awful lot of work to do. They are certainly going to be deploying capital.  So we continue to believe that it\u2019s in their best interest and good for our shareholders, as well to the extent that we can enter into an arrangement where they can have quick access to our site and potentially renegotiating the way some of the churn happens over time. So to spread that potential churn, which is we continue to believe it\u2019s in the range of 3% to 4% of our overall property revenue.  That\u2019s the overlap piece. And we continue to expect that could be spread out over time and we could give T-Mobile easy quick access to our sites through a holistic deal which will help them deploy their network. Yes. Thanks, Rick. And Ric, I\u2019ll just give you a couple of numbers there to back up what Tom was saying about the AFFO. So, the $45 million offsets are broken down with $10 million on lower maintenance CapEx. $25 million in lower net cash interest and $10 million in lower cash taxes. And Colby, maybe I\u2019ll just add a couple of comments on the accounts receivable issue. Not specific to Vodafone, but Tom covered that up. But just to put it into context, Q1 rolling into Q2, our accounts receivable has been very stable. So we didn\u2019t see any increase in our overall accounts receivable across the globe. Our DSO numbers are still in the mid to upper 30s. That\u2019s consistent Q2 over Q1.  So we\u2019ve been very pleased that not only in India, but also in terms of the COVID-19 impacts around the globe, we\u2019ve had very stable accounts receivable balances from Q1 to Q2 where our net receivables on the books at the end of Q1 was about $620 million. It's actually about $585 million at the end of Q2. With that said, you will see in our numbers that we took a bad debt reserve charge in Q2 of about $25 million.  And then, we also built into the back half of the forecast an additional $75 million. Those are both reserves at this point. So, we do expect that much of that will be collected. It just may \u2013 it may take us a little bit longer. So, we are trying to be cautious for the back half of the year. I\u2019d also let you know that we have the balances in our accounts receivable ledger that are over 90 days are 100% reserves coming out of Q2.  So, again, we look that as a pretty comfortable position. Maybe it\u2019s conservative position. Their reserves are not actually bad debt write-offs yet. So we do expect to collect a lot of that. It\u2019s just a matter of when. And of course, Vodafone is tied to AGR and we'll see how that gets resolved here soon."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Okay, thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. I hope that you are all healthy and well. As we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers, and surrounding communities. The remote work policies I mentioned on our last call continue to service well throughout our global footprint.  And I am pleased to say that there are even a few geographies where certain employees have been able to return to the office with numerous incremental safety measures in place. I am also happy to report that our business continues to perform well as we work closely with our tenants to preserve and enhance mobile connectivity, when it is needed the most.  And outside of FX impacts, which have moderated slightly over the last few months, we have to this point not seen material impacts from COVID-19 on our operations. As we move forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to provide high levels of service and drive solid results. The rest of my remarks today, similar to prior second quarter calls, will center on the key trends in return profiles we are seeing across our international business and what we expect in the future.  Since we entered Brazil and Mexico back in the late 1990s to provide geographic diversification to our foundational U.S. business, we\u2019ve added nearly 140,000 communication sites in 19 countries outside of United States, focusing on partnering with large multinational wireless carriers in select markets with strong property rights, rules of law and vibrant wireless industries.  Since day one of our international expansion strategy, our mandate has been clear, build and acquire multitenant exclusive franchise real estate assets that would generate attractive organic growth rates, while driving margin expansion and growing returns on invested capital overt the long-term.  And so with an emphasis on building leading market positions in the largest democracies across the world with a goal of positioning ourselves is either the top one or two tower company in each market.  This strategy has been underpinned by our proven risk underwriting process including among other things contemplating FX movements and local country inflation trends. As we discussed with you before, all of our investments are evaluated using a ten year unlevered DCF model with varying IRR hurdles due to the inclusion of appropriate risk adjustments to account for the specific local country risk, the type of that asset counterparty and a host of other factors.  These hurdles range from the mid-to-high single-digits in markets like the United States and Western Europe, to the mid-to-high teens in some of our more nascent African markets to ensure that our shareholders are being appropriately compensated for the level of risk being assumed.  This balanced approach to market risk has enabled us to evaluate each individual investment opportunity in the context of its risk-adjusted return profile, long-term AFFO accretion potential and the NPV expected to be generated rather than utilizing a specific cap as to how big any market or region can get or should get in relation to the United States.  Operationally, we are also executing a number of risk mitigation strategies. For example, our MLAs include primarily local CPI-based escalators. Our overall portfolio has significant diversification. And we selectively issue local currency debt where it makes sense.  Further, the vast majority of our local country generated net cash flows are denominated in the local currency and we are generally reinvesting those same cash flows back into those very same markets.  Lastly, we have mechanisms in place through which we are able to pass through the cost of land to our tenants in Latin America and the cost of fuel and power to our tenants across India and Africa, helping to further derisk significant portions of our operating expenses across these regions.  Taking all of these items into account, we believe we have a risk evaluation and mitigation framework that will enable us to continue to be successful internationally over the long-term. Within this context the primary thesis underlying our global strategy has always been and continues to be that the evolution of network technology that we\u2019ve seen in the United States will be replicated internationally, likely at an accelerated pace given the lack of fixed line penetration in many areas.  Our U.S. business model and international model are effectively the same. The sites look the same, the structures are comparable and the MLAs are fundamentally similar, but include the risk mitigation terms I discussed earlier. At the core, our international expansion serves as a way to significantly increase our total addressable market.  As consumers gain access to advanced smartphone handsets and mobile data usage increases, mobile network operators continue to deploy meaningful wireless CapEx. Service providers in international markets where we have a presence are expected to spend approximately $30 billion on their networks in 2020, in essence doubling the TAM of our U.S. market alone.  With mobile broadband penetration growing, we continue to expect to generate higher organic growth rates internationally and in the United States over the long-term while driving meaningful expansion in our international return on invested capital.  Fundamentally, we are utilizing our international strategy to increase and extend our overall global return profile. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has served to further highlight the criticality of wireless connectivity internationally, particularly in markets where fixed line penetration is minimum.  Unlike in the United States, where most of us are plugging into our Wi-Fi-enabled fixed line connections, as we work from home, mobile networks serve as the backbone of virtually all work-from-home functions in each international locations.  And as you can imagine, broad based stay-at-home orders and other restrictions that have been implemented in these markets over the last several months have led to additional strain in existing mobile networks.  For example, Vodafone Idea in India noted that they experienced a year\u2019s worth of data traffic across their network in a single week following the implementation of lockdown measures. Similarly, major carriers across Latin America, Africa and Europe have outlined significant spikes in data usage and regulators have allocated additional temporary spectrum and implemented other policies to help maintain connectivity.  As I mentioned earlier, we are committed to doing everything we can to support our tenants as they deal with the strain of this increased usage on their networks.  Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the attractive economics that we are driving across our international business. In the second quarter, our international operations accounted for approximately 43% of our property revenue and about a third of our property operating profit.  Our international tower and DAS properties drove an annualized cash gross margin of over $1.8 billion in the quarter resulting in a nearly 9.5% NOI yield on our more than $19 billion in total international tower and DAS investments, as you can see on Slide 6 of our earnings presentation.  This NOI yield includes both sites that we have recently acquired, as well as sites that have been in our portfolio for a number of years benefiting from long-term tenancy and revenue growth. Our most seasoned vintage of international sites those built or acquired prior to 2010 is yielding approximately 24% in U.S. dollar terms illustrating the power of operating leverage within our business.  We view this type of return profile as a clear indication that international tower assets have the capacity to drive economics that are equal to or better than the United States tower model over the long-term.  Importantly, I\u2019ll note that the NOI yield numbers I am referencing today are U.S. dollar equivalents. That is they take into account any foreign currency devaluation in a numerator, while freezing the denominator at historical exchange rates in the period in which the sites were acquired or built.  Over the last 20 years and especially since 2007, we have been steadily growing our international portfolio with a focus on macro towers in some of the largest three market democracies worldwide through a combination of our highly efficient newbuild programs and selective acquisitions including the Eaton Towers deal we closed at the end of last year.  We\u2019ve added more than a 130,000 international sites in just the last decade including more than 24,000 sites we built ourselves. These sites typically have lower initial returns due to lower initial tenancy. You can see this on the slide where sites we\u2019ve added to our international portfolio between 2010 and 2014 are generating yields of 10% and those added since 2015 are generating yields of around 8%.  Over time, our experience across all of our served markets has been that as networks mature, additional spectrum bands are deployed and consumers obtained advanced handsets both daily usage grows exponentially and significant additional network density becomes a necessity.  As a result, we\u2019ve seen sites that have initially produced modest returns, attract collocations and amendments with minimal incremental costs, thereby driving substantial upside over time, no different than what we\u2019ve experienced in the United States.  In Latin America, where we have owned and operated towers for now over two decades have invested approximately $8 billion and now have over 41,000 sites across eight countries, 4G deployments are in full swing. Our long time presence and scale have resulted in substantial business relationships with key operators in the region including AT&T, American Mobile and a number of others.  These relationships coupled with our extensive asset base has enabled us to drive average organic billings growth of around 10% in the region over the last five years, that\u2019s by strong levels of new business activity and a continuing appetite for mobile data. Although organic growth rates are down a bit in 2020 in part due to falling local CPI, we continue to expect a long trajectory of solid underlying growth.  We are also focused on a new build program if network densification efforts accelerate. In fact, we expect to construct over 500 sites across Latin America this year and anticipate strong demand for new builds in the region over a multiyear period.  Importantly, these new builds typically have day one NOI yields in the high-single-digit range with just one tenant with an average tenancy ratio of around 1.5 across the region, we believe we are well positioned to drive meaningful margin and return accretion in Latin America for many years to come.  In Africa, the majority of our markets are in earlier stages of the technology evolution with 4G penetration only around 10% and average mobile data usage being a fraction of LATAM numbers as a result. We\u2019ve invested approximately $5 billion across the continent and have an average tenancy of around 1.5 on our portfolio of nearly 19,000 sites, which are yielding roughly 11%.  Importantly, we partnered with key telecom operators like Vodafone, MTN and AirTel to bring enhanced connectivity to hundreds of millions of people. With extremely limited fixed line penetration, young tech savvy populations, and governments committed to modernizing economies through connectivity, we expect mobile broadband to play a foundational role in Africa\u2019s growth story over the next decade plus.  We also anticipate that continued organic growth, our new build program through which we expect to construct well over a 1,000 sites this year, and our ongoing business development efforts will enable us to build on the strong foundation we\u2019ve created in Africa as we deliver solid growth and increasing returns over the long-term.  At the same time, we are making substantial progress in our commitment to reduce the mobile industry\u2019s carbon footprint through our innovative power and fuel program. In African markets, where grid power in many areas tends to be unreliable, we are now deploying next-generation greener technologies including lithium ion batteries and solar solutions.  We expect to invest more than $60 million in 2020 to enhance the uptime performance of our sites in the region, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions after deploying an excess of $100 million over the last few years. Not only do these initiatives benefit our tenants through higher uptimes and more efficient operating capabilities, but also they represent a critical part of our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen.  These investments have helped enable us to reduce diesel consumption by more than 25% from 2017 to 2019 across our global footprint after normalizing for portfolio growth. Meanwhile, in Europe, where we have nearly 5,000 sites between Germany and France, and recently entered Poland by acquiring a handful of towers, networks are at a fairly mature stage with 4G having been broadly deployed over the last decade. \n, : Consequently, we continue to look for ways to expand our European portfolio, but only at valuations that with underlying growth expectations allow us to hit our required return thresholds. Our entry into Poland, although on a small-scale initially is an example of our continued focus on finding macro tower portfolios poised for sustainable growth in markets with attractive regulatory frameworks, supportive regulators, and vibrant wireless sectors, all at sensible valuations.  And finally, moving to India, where we will have invested over $5 billion, pro forma redeeming our minority interest, we believe the wireless industry has now completed a much needed and long awaited consolidation to enable the deployment of 4G technology throughout the country by the remaining carriers. Through this process, we\u2019ve experienced high levels of churns which is reflected in our current 8% NOI yield.  Although I\u2019d note that the more than $400 million in cash settlement payments we\u2019ve received from TATA are not incorporated in that number or it would be higher.  More recently, there have been pricing increases by all of the carriers in the marketplace, while the telecom regulator has indicated that it intends to be supportive of the carriers to rational spectrum policies and the Indian government continues to stress its Digital India initiative.  The key near-term issue that needs to get sorted out in the marketplace centers on the AGR decision by the Supreme Court including finalizing the timeline as to when the wireless carrier payments are to be made, particularly as it relates to Vodafone Idea. We are hopeful that India can return to being a significant growth engine for the company as it was for nearly a decade before the consolidation process kicked off several years ago.  We have several reasons for optimism in this regard. As I just mentioned, the market structure is now much more rational. Price competition in wireless has stabilized and the regulatory environment seems constructive. The Indian consumer has proven to have a tremendous appetite for mobile data with average smartphone usage per customer of well 10-gigabits per month, even before the impacts of COVID-19.  With that said, the majority of wireless users in India are still using legacy technologies, rather than 4G in large part because the networks are ill equipped and their current state to handle levels of traffic for more than 1 billion people. To get those networks ready, we continue to believe that significant levels of incremental network spending are necessary accompanied by material level of network densification.  With our nearly 75,000 site existing portfolio, and the additional sites we are adding through our new build program, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from our tenants\u2019 network deployments over an extended period of time.  Additionally, we are continuing to meaningfully participate in connecting the unconnected in India through our Digital Village program with more than a 150 Digital Villages in place today and more in development, we are proud to be making a difference in the areas of digital literacy, e-learning, tower help, as well as providing enhanced access to career opportunities in many rural Indian communities.  Looking forward, we believe that we have a compelling opportunity to further enhance our international business by driving organic growth, focusing on operational efficiency and continuing to build and acquire sites using our proven investment evaluation methodology. Our preference continues to be to add incremental scale to existing markets, while strengthening ties with large multinational wireless carriers.  But there are handful of additional markets that could be attractive for us as well. We also believe there are additional opportunities to generate margin improvement as we further standardize operational processes, create regional centers of excellence and further reduce our power and fuel requirements. We also believe there will be demand for many of our innovative initiatives to extend our core platform of capabilities for new and existing tenants.  So in summary, we believe that our diverse macro tower-focused international portfolio positions us well for a prolonged period of solid growth and attractive returns on invested capital. We can further augment this to disciplined selection acquisitions in new builds on a global basis. While we expect our foundational U.S. business to drive the majority of our cash flows for years to come, we think our international operations can enhance and extend our growth trajectory by effectively doubling our total addressable market size.  The global demand for mobile connectivity shows no sign of slowing and we believe we are positioned to play a critical role in extending the reach of mobile broadband, while generating strong total returns for our shareholders.  So, with that, let me hand it over to Rod to go through the details of our results and updated outlook. Rod? Hey Matt. How are you? This is Tom. On the T-Mobile side, based upon everything that I think they said publicly, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it really is just timing. And they are working through all their plans. They closed their deal in April then settled their transaction with DISH, not that long ago. So, we believe it clearly is timing. And are looking forward to really supporting them as they continue to really build out their network even further.  On the ATM side, it\u2019s good plumbing. It really is just having more flexibility. It\u2019s not a significant number clearly, compared to general ATM programs as part of market cap. So it really is just kind of good plumbing to have a flexibility of having access to a number of different sources of capital. Yes, Batiya [Ph] it\u2019s Tom. With regard to \u2013 I\u2019ll address the LATAM question first, I mean we are really excited about the opportunities that we continue to see down in the market, particularly in a market like Brazil which is still so underserved. I mean, if you take a look at customers per site, it\u2019s significantly higher than what we are seeing in the United States.  And so, we continue to see a \u2013 the opportunities for further densification where our build programs are continuing to grow. So we are actually very energized and our teams in the markets are very excited about the opportunities there. Yes, there is some consolidation perhaps going on in the market, but that was fully understood, fully expected. So there really no surprises there.  And I think the government themselves, particularly with regards to what we are seeing in the pandemic continue to want to drive a connectivity and digital connectivity in their markets. So, we are quite excited about that. And as you all know it represents a relatively small piece of revenues. I am sorry Batiya, [Ph] second question on the U.S. side, was? Yes. No. You are right. I mean, those \u2013 a vast majority of those sites come up for renewal towards the end of next year.  We believe they are obviously well positioned sites and we will likely try to mitigate as much of that churn potential as possible and hopeful that between the new build it\u2019s going on in the marketplace as well as, DISH's expectations for building out, they will be successful in terms of mitigating that. But that\u2019s all part of the lot of the negotiations and discussions that are going on as we speak. Yes. I mean, Jon, first on Brazil, just kind of getting a little bit deeper into the market, it\u2019s a market that we expect the wireless CapEx is going to be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. So, obviously, very, very strong, a high growth market for us. The CapEx percent of carrier revenue is to be around 25%, which is actually a bit higher than we\u2019ve seen in prior years consistent with last year.  So we think that that\u2019s a good sign. Their margins are in the 40%. So the carriers themselves, I think are quite well capitalized and very focused on building out their 4G overall initiatives. The local CPI is actually been down over the last several years, so was our escalators in concert with it. And that\u2019s being really reflected in some of the 2020 escalator that we are seeing this year.  But Vivo, Tim, America Movil, including Nextel, in that transaction is relatively insignificant relative to our overall growth rates. And we are seeing organic tenant billings growth of over 8% in Q2, churn was in the kind of the mid 1% to 1.7% for the year. And we expect for the year overall, billings growth is 7%. So, we are bullish on the marketplace. We think we are well positioned.  We have really solid relationships with what we expect to be kind of the three main players in the marketplace. And as I mentioned before, we believe that the networks are overburdened. They have roughly 3000 to 4000 sims for sell-side. It\u2019s really twice what we are seeing in the U.S. So, the teams are excited or bullish. We are building out sites. We have a lot of interesting things, I think, going on with the various carriers. And so, we are excited about what we expect in the marketplace.  On the India side, again, if you take a look at the kind of the total growth that we\u2019ve seen in the market, and again it\u2019s double-digits on a total gross basis. Carrier spending continues to be strong, building out their networks. They continue to make the network investments to support the overall usage demands. I mean, I think I mentioned in some of my comments that, we really remain optimistic about the market.  The structure is now much more rational. There is price competition and wireless has actually stabilized and the regulatory environment is very, very constructive. There is a significant appetite for mobile data from a customer perspective. They are using over 10 gig per month and that was even before the COVID-19 impact.  So, as well as they are still using the significant legacy technologies, 2G technologies, rather than even 4G. So we think is that the network continues to get equipped as the government continues to expand its overall Digital India strategy that there is going to be a significant amount of further densification and network investment going on in the marketplace. No. I mean, they have been very interested. I mean, very, very steady in terms of their build out. You\u2019ve heard them kind of tweak what they expect their overall CapEx expectations are probably for the year. But for us, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We are expecting to be so. Sure, Jon. I think that the fact that we are seeing another \u2013 number of hyperscalers investing in India is a very good thing. There are significant investments being made into the networks. They see the same things that we do in terms of the kind of the digital transformation that\u2019s going on in the marketplace and they are bringing many more applications and products to the consumers to those particular markets.  And given that the wire line penetration is very, very low in that market, as well as most of the markets that we are in outside of the United States. We think that then most of that traffic to be able to utilize those applications is going to go over those wireless networks and clearly the carriers are going to want to invest in their networks to be able to support it.  It\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve seen here in the United States. And so, I think it\u2019s a very good sign candidly. And I would hope that we would continue to see more of that kind of activity being in \u2013 occurring in the markets outside where we have a presence. Well, I mean, the underlying premise clearly is that, we believe the cloud is moving to the edge and we see this. There are a number of factors that are supporting it, whether if you are looking at CRAN, you are looking at what\u2019s going on with cloud infrastructure and with the deployment of 5G, we think that enterprise customers are going to be looking for low latency access as well as cloud, kinds of capabilities out of the edge. And so, we remain very bullish on the whole opportunity.  We do have a number of trial sites. I think we have five or six trial sites down in the Southeast and actually out in west. And the way we are looking at it really is that, at this point in time, there are really kind of a couple of distinct trends that we are paying attention to. First of all, on the distributed compute and then more broadly on the mobilized computing where we think that the TAM is going to be significantly higher and that we will be able to create some scale.  And we've talked about the distributed compute, which is really where we are focused right now with regards to a number of our kind of trial sites. And that\u2019s where enterprise workloads moving to the public cloud and there is a growing near-term market segment use for on and off for private cloud computing in somewhat of a hybrid solution.  And so, when in many of the sites that we have, we have 50 kilowatts of power and we are providing kind of local compute capability for mid and smaller sized enterprises. And so, it\u2019s an interesting market segment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually being serviced, particularly well today. But clearly, that\u2019s not the big opportunity that we see going forward.  The big opportunity is clearly on the mobile edge compute. And it\u2019s one where we think that we are actually going to be able to further scale. But we are really just in the early innings of it. But the concept of the strategy is that we expect we\u2019ll be able to build a neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud datacenter in several thousand of our sites that we have across the country.  And we do have a meet-me room/data center in Atlanta, which is, as I said tied to a major datacenter down in the marketplace. And so, we are tracking in the opportunity and what it will mean to be able to really develop this type of a strategy. We realize that we don\u2019t have lots of the skill sets that are going to be required to really scale this.  And so, like our other kind of innovative initiatives, very potentially we\u2019ll look to partner to be able to gain access to those kinds of skill sets and capabilities, distribution, software engineers, those types of things to really be able to scale and grow the opportunity. So, early innings as I said, but we remain quite bullish on the overall opportunity. And you, as well. Ric, it will come down to math. Right, it\u2019s really a TBD type of an event. We expect really based upon what T-Mobile has said is that, they are going to need thousands of sites over and above what they are expecting right now after the decommissioning, right? And so, there could be an opportunity for those sites. There could be an opportunity for those sites in the hands of somebody else.  And so, it\u2019s a bit of three dimensional chess right now in terms of what these transactions with all of our customers and potential customers. I would expect that there will be churn of some sort. I don\u2019t know it will be all at once or over an extended period of time. But we believe that longer-term, there are clearly going to be a number of offsets and if you just take a look at the wireless growth that we are seeing in the marketplace.  And what we\u2019d expect and the amount of capital that all these carriers are looking to spend and the fact that this is going to be coming into the full there, we would expect solid growth going forward. But, so it\u2019s really a TBD at this point. I would want to give you a sense of that anything is certain, or anything is put in concrete we continue to work all those items with our customers. Right. Well, I mean, they also have network requirements that they need to adhere to. And I think that the 2023 I think is the first commitment that they\u2019ve made. So, I would expect to see them hit market in 2021. I think that's a better question for T-Mobile. I mean, I think it is a good sign. They brought in Dave Mayo. I think he'll do a terrific job there. And time will tell in terms of what it looks like.  But we are there to service them and support them in any way that they feel necessary and we think that we've got a portfolio of assets that really can be helpful to them. And I think they appreciate that as well. So, but I would expect that we\u2019ll start to see them towards the end of this year into 2021. They are not in our forecast.  They are not in our guidance until we really have a more formal arrangement with them and understand what their demands are going to be, we won\u2019t put them into our forecast. Yes, I mean, it\u2019s interest. It\u2019s maintenance CapEx. It\u2019s cash access. It\u2019s kind of the typical group of items below EBITDA that impact AFFO that we are seeing some positive benefits from. We continue to be very positive on the indoor spot, our indoor space. We think that the unlicensed here access spectrum in the U.S. that\u2019s a potential to really transform, if you will the overall indoor connectivity landscape. It improves the overall TAM clearly, and it reduces the overall total ownership cost. And so, we are very positive - we have the number of trials going on, Ric, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past.  But again, it\u2019s early innings right now in terms of what that opportunity is. We have 400 DAS locations, if you will, around the country with a TAM of probably a couple thousand. But we think that given the cost components of being able to open up, feed the network, exactly TAMs would increase ten-fold.  And so, what we are seeing, what that looks like, we are taking a look at what those relationships are going to look like then with the landlords across the country. But we are energized by what we think we might be able to \u2013 and how we might be able to position ourselves. Yes. Sure, Dave. I think on the CPI side, the escalator, I think in the quarter was roughly 3.7% and that really, again the way they work, it works off with the 2019 kind of the inflation number is which drive what the escalator would be. So our escalator is down. And if you think about, even looking at Brazil for example, the growth rates in Brazil, my sense, we are up in the kind of even the 10% range in the last couple of years if I recall.  And we are now down in kind of that 7%, 8% range. And so, it has a significant impact, if you will kind of going forward. And as you know it\u2019s very volatile on a year-to-year basis, but it can impact the overall organic growth rate by a couple 100 basis points one way or another.  With regards to Mexico, a fair question in terms of Telefonica and their interest in the marketplace. We have a terrific relationship with AT&T in the market and we are working closely with both Telefonica and AT&T right now on that transition and what that might look like over the next several years. And so, it\u2019s a TBD. We are in the middle of it. And as I said, I think we are really well positioned to be able to support both our customers as they transition their network. Tim, are you talking about O-RAN or? Yes. It\u2019s very interesting. I mean, I do think the whole O-RAN opportunity which we\u2019ve seen in other markets, by the way, we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world is definitely starting to take hold here in the United States and ultimately we could see even the large carriers looking to take certain segments of their spectrum, certain segments of their technology and really opening it up. It kind of ties to my thoughts before in terms of kind of that cloud even becoming closer and closer to the edge.  Now, keep in mind that, that\u2019s kind of what happens behind the curtain. So, that\u2019s happening back on the RAN side away from the impact on the towercos. So, my intent is that any opportunity for the carriers, wireless carriers and potential new players in the marketplace to be able to bring down their total cost of ownership will then allow them to have more capital available to spend on the RAN, which is really where we come in, right?  And so, we don\u2019t expect any of the kind of the O-RAN implications to impact at all what\u2019s happening from the site out to the device. And as I said, it\u2019s in fact the total cost of ownership comes down as a result of the kind of the open nature of the infrastructure that might allow more capital to be able to spent on where we come in, which is from the tower out to the device.  And so, we are cautiously optimistic on the opportunity for O-RAN in the United State, as well as many of our international markets. It all comes down to band, it all comes down to densification. We don\u2019t see any change. I mean, the economics are still clearly that the macro tower can be able to support much more efficiently their customer base.  Now there are going to be certain locations, there may be certain technologies, certain band that can be better utilized and supportive at a small cell than in those dense urban markets. But we don\u2019t see it any different right now. Those dense urban markets, the New York City kind of things, just because of interference, talking about high bands, just like what Verizon is doing today.  So, I don\u2019t expect really any change to that. It\u2019s going to be a function of band. It\u2019s going to be a function of the densification of the markets that they are trying to serve, really the topography of what they are trying to serve. But we don\u2019t see any change at all and they use the small cells versus macro. Yes, So, Colby, let me try to address a couple and Rod can add a few comments as well. On the whole, Vodafone India situation, I mean, I don\u2019t want to get into specifics there. I think if you step back and if you take a look at where the government is, I mean the government has definitely advocated for having three strong players in the marketplace.  They are currently working through as the other carriers are with the Supreme Court in terms of where that final AGR issue is going to land. We are hopeful that there will be some resolution to this even over the next 30 to 45 days or so. There is a hearing I think in mid-August for the carriers that are no longer and providing service.  But we hope that that will provide some guidance for how the payments \u2013 the extended payments will be made \u2013 have to be made by the carriers themselves. I mean, they\u2019ve made some sizable good base installments, as best I can tell in terms of what is owed in the marketplace. And they are aggressively trying to restructure to save cost and compete in the marketplace. And so, yes, I mean, there is some slow paying going on in the marketplace. We are working very closely with them as we would be working with any customer who is going through a similar situation. So more to come. You saw what some of our expectations were relative to how we looked at outlook for the balance of the year. But kind of given the direction of the government, given what we are seeing in the marketplace, again we remain optimistic and cautiously optimistic about their ability to continue and to grow.  I am sorry, Colby your question on the U.S. side was, the exit rate. It will largely be a \u2013 candidly a function of the kind of growth that we are going to be seeing later in the year by the various carriers in terms of their overall investments in their network. You heard Rod talked about that we are talking about an overall growth rate based upon what we are seeing right now and kind of that 4.5-ish range. So, it\u2019s down a little bit, again, largely tied \u2013 almost exclusively tied to the timing of T-Mobile. So, we are optimistic that T-Mobile will pickup pace and we\u2019ll see that increase in activity. And I think that will bode well foregoing into 2021. And the whole notion of the churn relative to Sprint, as we talked about before, that's a TBD in terms of where does the math sets aligned for us and where can we best service our customers in terms of whether that will be over an extended period of time or whether that would be taken more upfront. So, more to come on that one. Thanks everybody for joining. Have a great day and stay healthy and safe."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Tower Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nIgor Khislavsky: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Before the rest of my comments, I'll note that due to COVID-19, all of us on the call this morning are dialing in remotely from different locations. So to the extent there are any minor technical difficulties on the call, we would ask that you bear with us. Our agenda for this morning will be as follows. First, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the first quarter. Next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide some brief commentary on our U.S. business. Next, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2020 results and updated 2020 outlook. And finally, our Executive Chairman, Jim Taiclet, will share a few closing remarks. After these comments, we will take your questions. I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include: our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2020 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance, our expectation regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  Now please turn to Slide four of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter. During the quarter, our property revenue increased 10.5% to nearly $2 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 14.1% to $1.3 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by roughly 5% to $907 million and $2.03, respectively. These consolidated AFFO metrics were impacted by a onetime cash interest charge of approximately $63 million associated with our purchase of MTN's minority stakes in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda during the quarter. Absent this onetime item, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share would have grown by more than 12%. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by roughly 4.4% to $415 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Igor, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and well. Typically, in our first quarter earnings call, we would talk exclusively about our U.S. business, and how it is positioned in the market. But given that there is nothing typical in the world in which we live today, I'd like to first discuss how we are navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, including its historical impact on the global economy. Our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers and surrounding communities. Most of our team members globally are working from home. To facilitate this, we bolstered our IT environment to support more remote work and established alternative business processes and solutions to overcome the need to have work accomplished from our office or at our established operational centers. We're practicing social distancing in a few instances where certain employees need to be in the office and have provided added equipment and supplies for those considered essential and needed to be out in our sites supporting our tenants. We're also in the process of establishing our overall guidelines and procedures for an eventual return to work in our offices across the globe. These guidelines will adhere to government directives and be supplemented by reasonable and practical criteria based on local situational needs and circumstances. The reopening process will be based on safety readiness levels and will not commence until I'm certain we have complete access to the necessary critical resources and supplies. I also want to emphasize that while immersed in all this activity and uncertainty, relative to just how long this crisis will last, we remain focused on continuing to meet the needs of our tenants. To that end, I want to note that to this point, the direct effects of the virus on our core business outside of translational FX impacts have been modest. While we're continually monitoring the COVID-19 impacts, our business model globally has demonstrated its resiliency and stability. Now more than ever, our infrastructure is incredibly critical to ensure our tenants are able to keep their customers connected. As a result, in many of our served markets, including the United States, we have received official priority designations that enable tower-related work to continue, largely uninterrupted. In a few locations, we have experienced some limitations and restrictions, particularly with respect to new builds and other discretionary tower work. In fact, in certain locations, new construction is currently prohibited. While these impacts have so far been modest, we do expect some slight delays in our new build pipeline and colocation activity in certain areas, but do believe these delays will be temporary. All in all, our business and operational focus will continue to be to prioritize actions, projects and capital allocation initiatives that extend, deepen and secure connectivity throughout our served markets. We are proud to help deliver meaningful connectivity to billions of people around the world at an important time like this and are focused on maintaining its continuity. This then brings me to the original topic I wanted to cover with you this morning, and that's of our business here in the United States. In 2020, at the midpoint of our outlook, our U.S. business is expected to represent about 57% of our consolidated property revenues and around 2/3 of our consolidated property operating profit. The U.S. operation is the foundation of our consolidated business and will continue to be for many years to come. Mobile data usage growth of at least 30% per year has driven significant levels of colocations and amendments on our U.S. assets over the last decade. And we expect that growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In fact, according to industry estimates, the average U.S. smartphone user consumed around nine gigabytes per month in 2019, which is up some 450% from just five years ago. Incredibly, by 2025, that same user is projected to consume over 45 gigabytes per month. To account for the strain that this usage growth will create on mobile networks, we believe that our tenants will continue to invest significant amounts of capital into our infrastructure. Over the last five years, this spending has averaged upwards of $30 billion per year. In fact, it's increased over the past 20 years as each new technology generation has been deployed, dating back to 2G. And we would expect that number to remain steady, if not rise, over the next few years, particularly given the recent completion of the Sprint, T-Mobile merger. A significant portion of our tenants' network investments in future years is expected to be 5G focused. And I'll take some time to cover our latest high-level thoughts around 5G and what that might mean for our business in a moment. But first, I'd like to spend a few minutes laying out the key characteristics and return profile of our U.S. business. Our U.S. portfolio, comprised of nearly 41,000 sites, has been created over the last 20-plus years through a number of M&A transactions, complemented by our internal new build program. We've consistently focused on sites with premier locations, significant capacity for lease-up, attractive land lease arrangements and modest requirements for ongoing maintenance CapEx. Perhaps the single biggest driver of value in these assets over the long-term has been the tenant lease contracts or master lease agreements that accompany them, which we have purposely designed to both deliver compelling value to the tenant and secure attractive economics for American Tower. Our requirement for exclusive franchise real estate locations in mission-critical areas has supported our ability to implement these contract structures to generate a consistent, recurring, growing base of cash flow. As you can see on Slide 6, that focus on tower and other franchise real estate assets has resulted in sustained attractive organic tenant billings growth for American Tower, averaging more than 6% over the past five years. The combination of strong colocation and amendment trends, annual contractual escalators and consistently low churn in the U.S. have been key drivers of this growth, as we've capitalized on the deployment and densification of 4G networks across the country. We've translated this strong organic tenant billings growth into attractive NOI yields across our portfolio, particularly for assets that we've owned over the long-term. For example, we're generating yields of 24% on sites we owned prior to 2005 and yields of 17% on sites added to the portfolio from 2005 to 2010. On assets added after 2010, including those from our GTP and Verizon transactions, NOI yields averaged around 6% as of the end of the first quarter. We believe there is significant upside in this vintage of sites as additional equipment is deployed, particularly given the expected acceleration of 5G rollouts over the next few years. Our U.S. tower leadership team has done a terrific job managing our base of assets in the U.S., having locked in more than $28 billion in contractually committed revenue as of the end of the first quarter. Margins in this business, including all of the M&A completed over the last several years, have continued to expand with the property segment operating profit margin coming in at nearly 79% in Q1, accompanied by cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue of just 4.1%. Additionally, our U.S. business ROIC has continued to rise over the last 10 years, while we have nearly doubled our asset base. We now have around 3,000 tenants in the U.S., including a vertical segment focusing on nontraditional tenants. This segment, although still in relatively early stages of development, generated more than 15% of our non-MLA related U.S. [new] [ph] business in the quarter. From an operational perspective, over the past year, our U.S. team has been focused on automating tasks to reduce cycle times, implementing a fleet of drones to secure more accurate data on our sites and implementing several new innovative contract structures, providing process efficiencies for both ourselves and our tenants and reducing the need for site-specific evaluations. From a macro industry perspective, over the next few years, we see several trends unfolding in the U.S. First, we believe the cloud is going to come closer to the edge. Second, 5G will be deployed using a number of different spectrum bands, depending upon the specific areas coverage and capacity requirements, which will look like as somewhat labeled, like a 3-layer cake, opening up the network to allow for a multitude of different customer experiences. And third, the variety of end-user devices and applications is expected to grow faster than we could possibly imagine. In addition, much of this activity should enable our customers to be able to wirelessly transmit data at a lower cost per bit. The overall increase in our tenants resulting value proposition, driven by continued 4G and new 5G network deployments on our infrastructure, will, we expect, continue to increase our NOI yields and returns on invested capital. While we expect to have 4G-related infrastructure on our sites for years to come, we believe ubiquitous 5G deployments are also on our doorstep. What is interesting is that, in fact, each of the major carriers have initially deployed 5G in their own unique ways. Multiple spectrum bands have been and will continue to be deployed, spanning the range from high-band millimeter wave in cities to low band, like 600 megahertz, in rural areas and will ultimately be coupled with mid-band spectrum to support their customers' needs around suburbs and highway corridors. Importantly, we continue to believe that the majority of the sub-6 gigahertz spectrum deployments throughout the country will be on macro towers, and that mid-band spectrum will be a critical component of our tenants' 5G networks. We continue to expect mid-band deployments to accelerate beginning in the second half of this year as the new T-Mobile builds out more of its 2.5-gig spectrum for the foreseeable future. As I mentioned, we also expect spending on 4G networks to continue, given that the migration of the user base from 4G to 5G will take a number of years. Bottom line, we believe that as a result, a tremendous amount of incrementally more complex equipment should end up on our towers across the U.S. over the next five to 10 years, allowing our business to continue to excel. As I mentioned, we believe that over the next several years, the cloud is going to get closer to the edge. We're already seeing this trend from the major hyperscalers, and as a result, continue to evaluate the opportunities that might be there for us. What will also be interesting is how the hyperscale and cloud service providers will interact and position themselves with the carriers. So as a result, we continue to explore trials and partnerships with a variety of different players, including hyperscalers, cloud service providers, carriers, data center companies and equipment suppliers to see just how our infrastructure may plug into this new environment. Using our existing set of assets on the edge data center front, we continue to learn about the rapidly evolving edge ecosystem through our ownership of the metro interconnect facility in Atlanta and initial deployments of several trial edge data facilities at our tower sites. At a high level, we continue to believe that as information generation and processing progressively moves to the network edge, particularly with respect to advanced IoT applications, there will be a greater need for lower latency through distributed storage and compute functionality in close proximity to both wireless and wireline end consumers. Edge compute offerings may eventually serve autonomous vehicle networks, interactive and immersive media delivery, cloud gaming and any number of other products and services where lower latency is a must and/or data needs to be closer to the consumer machine, where we believe the opportunity for us can truly scale. And while the potential for a scaled mobile edge solution is likely several years away, we are seeing initial positive indications of customer interest in our assets and are also having numerous conversations with a number of parties that are likely to play a significant role in the edge going forward. One such example is with Microsoft through their Azure Edge Zones program, where we are now a named partner. As time goes on, we are hopeful that other partnerships will develop to help us accelerate the development of the edge data model. On the indoor connectivity side, we continue to explore ways to leverage carrier-grade Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and CBRS spectrum to create converged networks. These targeted neutral host solutions can make sense in a much broader array of venues than traditional DAS. So in other words, drastically increasing the total addressable market. We've been part of the CBRS alliance for many years and have several CBRS-based deployments throughout the country. As demand for better, faster and more secure network connectivity continues to accelerate in apartment buildings, class A office space and other similar locations, we are positioning American Tower to hopefully play a meaningful role in satisfying that demand. Here, again, we are likely at least a few years away from potentially scaling CBRS-based neutral host systems but are already seeing positive indications of demand for fixed wireless access, private networks and other solutions in these types of locations. As we look at these and other U.S.-based innovation opportunities, I want to underscore that our investment criteria and philosophy remains the same: we are looking for scalable, exclusive, multi-tenant franchise real estate digital infrastructure opportunities that have the potential to deliver consistent, sustainable, recurring growth for us with returns that rival those of our existing tower model. Taking these innovation initiatives together with our high-performing existing U.S. business, we are energized about the future. The secular trends driving demand for space on our franchise real estate assets continues to accelerate, and we believe we are optimally positioned to convert that demand into attractive total returns for our stockholders over the long-term. Further, our business has performed extremely well through a variety of economic and capital market cycles, and we are confident that American Tower will again stand and deliver through the current turmoil. With that, I turn the call over to Rod to go through our results for the quarter and our updated full year outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining. Before I dive into our first quarter results, I'd like to also take a moment and acknowledge the COVID-19 pandemic that is affecting all of us. My thoughts and best wishes go out to our employees, tenants, vendors and to each of you on the call this morning. I hope you all are safe and healthy through this difficult time. Let's now turn to our first quarter results. As you saw in today's press release, we began 2020 with a solid quarter, as mobile data consumption continued to grow across the globe. In fact, in many of our markets, particularly internationally, mobile data traffic has increased as a result of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of wireless services everywhere and the critical nature of our global portfolio of communications real estate. To start, I'd like to note a few of our first quarter achievements. Specifically, we met our expectations for organic tenant billings growth rates across the globe, led by Africa at 9.3%, Latin America at 7.5% and the U.S. at 5.6%. We grew our property revenue in tenant billings by more than 10%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 230 basis points over the prior year. We made substantial progress integrating the more than 8,000 sites we acquired at the end of 2019 in Africa and Latin America. We've built approximately 1,000 new sites. We strengthened our balance sheet and now have $5.4 billion of liquidity pro forma for our new term loan from earlier this month. And we grew our common stock dividend by 20% again. Before we discuss the details of our full year outlook, let's first spend a few minutes reviewing our financial and operational results for the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 8, and we will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. For the quarter, you can see that our underlying growth remains solid throughout our markets. Due to strong demand for our assets across the globe and on an FX-neutral basis, we met our internal expectations for revenue. As Igor mentioned earlier, our first quarter consolidated property revenue of approximately $1,970,000,000, grew by $187 million or 10.5% over Q1 of last year. This included a headwind of roughly $48 million from unfavorable FX translations. Our U.S. segment represented 55% of both our consolidated property revenue and the corresponding growth, while our international segments accounted for the remaining 45%. As always has been the case, the critical components of our consolidated property revenue are those items that impact our recurring tenant billings revenue, including around $79 million in colocations and amendments, a similar level to prior quarters. Our consistent and reliable contractual escalators, which added $50 million, our day one incremental tenant billings resulting from our returns-based and disciplined capital investments, which contributed $72 million and includes M&A and new builds. These positive items were partially offset by lease non-renewals or churn, which reduced our tenant billings revenue by $49 million for the quarter. Looking at our major business segments; our U.S. property segment revenue totaled nearly $1.1 billion for the quarter and grew by $104 million or 10.5% over the prior year period. Our international property revenue of $883 million grew by $84 million or 10.5% over last year's levels. As expected, we saw solid demand from our major carrier tenants around the globe. This demand was driven by the carriers' need to continually invest in their networks in order to keep pace with the exploding growth in mobile data consumption. Moving to the right side of the slide, you will see that our consolidated organic tenant billings growth also met our expectations, coming in at 5.4% for the quarter. For our U.S. property segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6%, comprised of new business activity, which totaled 4.5%; pricing escalators, which totaled 3.3%; and churn of 2%; and a roughly 0.3% negative impact from other items, which partially offset the items I mentioned above. As expected, this growth rate reflects a deceleration from prior quarters, partially driven by the impact of the pending Sprint, T-Mobile merger had on new business activity levels. Now that the merger has closed, we stand ready to support the new T-Mobile as it begins to invest significant capital and to perform the earnest work of integrating two complex networks, deploying diverse spectrum holdings and servicing more than 100 million subscribers, all while preparing for a 5G future. Regarding our international segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1%, led by Africa at more than 9% and Latin America at 7.5%. Europe totaled just about 2%, while India came in with a decline of around 1%, which was in line with our expectations, given anticipated churn and market conditions. The component parts of our international organic tenant billings growth were new business activity, which totaled 7%; our mostly local inflation-based pricing escalators, which totaled 3.6%; other items, which contributed around 20 basis points and partially offsetting these increases was churn of 5.8%, largely attributable to previously anticipated cancellations in India. Turning to slide nine. You can see our first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion grew by $157 million or 14.1% over the prior year period. As a result of our continued focus on driving organic growth, adding new assets and managing costs throughout our business, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.8% for the quarter, which was up 230 basis points compared to Q1 of last year. I will also note that these results include the impacts of around $16 million in incremental bad debt recorded in India due to some slow payments of accounts receivable from certain tenants, including government-owned BSNL. We think it's likely we will collect these receivables in the future, but for now, we have provided for them by increasing our bad debt reserves. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by approximately $26 million or 2.3% for FX fluctuations as compared to Q1 of last year. Our U.S. property segment operating profit of $858 million grew by $105 million or nearly 14% over the year-ago period, while our international property segment operating profit of $448 million grew by $62 million or 16% over last year's level. As a result, our U.S. segment represented 66% of our property segment operating profit in the quarter and 63% of the corresponding growth, while international accounted for the remaining 34% and 37%, respectively. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $907 million grew by $45 million or 5.3% over the year-ago period. Our consolidated AFFO per share of $2.03 grew by $0.09 or 4.6% over last year's levels. It is important to consider that the consolidated AFFO results include the impact of a onetime cash interest expense charge totaling $63 million as a result of our purchase of MTN's stake in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda. Absent this non-recurring charge, our consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share growth would have been 12.6% and 12.4%, respectively. As a reminder, we now expect a gap between consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to common stockholders to be modest in future years as a result of these minority stake purchases and our expected purchase of the remaining Tata stake in our India business, which is anticipated for later this year. Moving to Slide 10, let's now take a look at our updated expectations for 2020. To start, I will address a few of the business issues that require careful consideration as we updated our full year outlook. First and foremost is the COVID-19 pandemic. Although its full year impact on the world is not yet known, to date, on a constant currency basis, we have experienced only modest impacts. In fact, in many of our international markets, markets that have little or no fixed line infrastructure, our tenants are actually seeing increases in mobile data consumption across their networks, which may increase demand for our sites over time. As stated earlier, this highlights the world's growing reliance on wireless services and evidences the critical nature of our global portfolio of communications real estate. With that said, COVID-19 has caused global financial turmoil and material moves in many foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Of course, these FX moves are having a negative impact on our updated full year outlook. I'll discuss the detail of those impact shortly. But in the general context of the current FX volatility, I will note that we routinely review our hedging policies and often engage with the help of specialized external advisers in doing so. Although we have hedged purchase prices for certain international transactions in the past, historically, we have concluded that the potential benefit of actively hedging our ongoing translational FX exposure are not worth the real economic cost. Instead, we rely on natural hedges such as the portfolio effect of our '19 markets, our reinvestment of locally generated operating cash flow through new builds and M&A activity and select issuances of local currency debt. In addition, most of our tenant leases in international markets have annual local inflation-based escalators or are denominated in U.S. dollars. At this stage, we do not anticipate any significant changes in our approach to hedging, but as always, we continue to evaluate our options. Next, in the U.S., T-Mobile recently completed its merger with Sprint. As a result, we continue to anticipate an acceleration of spending from the new T-Mobile to begin in the second half of the year. In addition, beyond 2020, we believe this industry shift may result in a sustained increase in wireless industry capital spending as 5G deployments ramp and Dish supported its network. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from the future 5G deployments as carriers continue to focus on network quality. Finally, in India, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the fees, penalties and interest assessments associated with the previous ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenues. Although the total liability has been reaffirmed, we don't yet know the pacing and duration of the required payments on the part of the carriers, particularly in the context of the current COVID-19 situation. Taking these updated considerations and our assessment of market conditions into account and based on the proven resilience of our global business, our total property revenue outlook on a constant currency basis is unchanged. However, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as compared to our prior outlook are expected to negatively impact reported property revenues for the full year by approximately $300 million. For organic tenant billings growth, we are reiterating our outlook across most of our geographic segments. However, for Africa, we now expect organic tenant billings growth of around 9% for the year, down from 11% in our initial outlook. This is being driven by a reclassification of certain revenues out of tenant billings rather than a shift in the underlying fundamentals of our Africa business. Looking at Slide 11, you will see that we are also affirming our underlying expectations for adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our outlook outside of an FX translational impact of approximately $165 million. This includes the expectation that cash, SG&A as a percent of total revenue will be right around 8%. Lastly, we are reiterating our expectations for consolidated AFFO for the year on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to carefully manage our cash interest expense and cash taxes, while converting the vast majority of our cash adjusted EBITDA growth into consolidated AFFO growth. As a result, outside of roughly $140 million or $0.32 per share and unfavorable FX translation impacts, our consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share projections are unchanged. Although we are not surprised by how well our business has performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor events closely as the full impacts of this crisis develop. I would also note that to the extent that local market measures, like shelter-in-place orders are prolonged, we could eventually experience some timing issues regarding new business commencements, new builds or even accounts receivable collections. Flipping to Slide 12, I'd like to now briefly discuss our capital allocation plans for the year, which remain broadly consistent with our prior view. Our full year dividend declaration, subject to the approval of our Board, is expected to be approximately $2 billion, resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20% once again. We also expect to deploy $1.2 billion towards our CapEx program, with 85% of that investment being discretionary. As a result of COVID-19 and the associated FX impacts, we now expect a reduction of $50 million from our prior CapEx outlook. This includes a $30 million reduction in redevelopment CapEx, $5 million in lower maintenance CapEx and $15 million in lower development capital spending, in part due to a delay of construction of approximately 1,000 new builds in India. In the first quarter, we deployed $524 million to buy MTN's minority stakes in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda and have earmarked another $328 million at March 31, 2020, exchange rates for our pending purchase of Tata's remaining interest in our India business. In addition, we have spent roughly $49 million on other M&A so far this year and have deployed about $55 million through April 22 to share repurchases. Given our strong balance sheet and current liquidity, we expect to fund the entirety of our 2020 capital deployment plans with cash on hand, cash from operations and modest levels of revolver borrowings. We also expect to explore additional opportunities to extend and ladder our debt maturities and reduce our overall cost of borrowings. As a result, we anticipate continuing our long track record of generating strong consolidated AFFO per share growth, while simultaneously growing our return on invested capital. Turning now to Slide 13, I will briefly summarize the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our current liquidity position, which we believe is unmatched in our sector. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.3 billion in cash and $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed an additional one year term loan of nearly $1.2 billion, increasing our liquidity on a pro forma basis to more than $5 billion. Our net leverage at the end of the quarter was 4.6 times, in line with our targeted range and consistent with our historical levels. Our weighted average cost of debt was around 3.1%, and our weighted average debt tenor was over five years. Regarding our debt maturities for 2020, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced the redemption of our $750 million, 2.8% unsecured notes, leaving us with just $350 million in the remaining maturities this year. As a result of our prudent financial policies that have been implemented and enhanced over the last decade and the overall stability and resilience of our business, we believe we are in an extremely strong financial position amid the current market turmoil. We expect this to enable us to continue to be opportunistic with respect to investing and growth, including M&A opportunities on a global basis. If you would please turn to slide 14, I will conclude my comments with a brief summary. Despite the global pandemic, we had a good start to 2020 as we achieved solid organic tenant billings growth, expanded our margins and ROIC, started integrating the portfolios acquired at the end of 2019 and once again, increased our quarterly dividend by 20%. We further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet, increasing our current liquidity to $5.4 billion and positioning ourselves to comfortably fund our 2020 capital deployment plan, while expanding our global power portfolio through opportunistic M&A. And finally, outside of the translational FX impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our outlook remains largely unchanged, highlighting the critical nature of wireless services everywhere as mobile data consumption continues to grow at a dramatic pace across the globe. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Rod, and good morning, everyone. To each of you on the call today, I wish you and yours a safe and healthy path to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Tom stated earlier, our top priority in American Tower is the health and safety of our global workforce. Our dedicated employees and managers throughout the company are committed to keeping critical telecommunications infrastructure fully operational and functional in their communities. The senior executive team and management throughout ATC are doing everything they can to support our global teams in this essential work. Our company is also contributing to those communities financially through our philanthropy and CSR programs and through the American Tower Foundation. This includes everything from working in Boston, Massachusetts with local and state support funds for citizens in need, to funding and donating PPE to health workers throughout the U.S., to helping with the government of India's COVID-19 recovery fund and many more. In addition, Commerce Secretary Ross and I have agreed to immediately pivot the entire near-term work effort of the U.S.-India CEO Forum, which we co-chair, toward COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts in the world's two largest democracies. We are fully engaged with the GOI and our Indian counterpart companies in this effort. As ATC's Executive Chairman, I have been offering guidance regarding our COVID-19 response, while also working very closely with Tom to ensure a smooth and seamless management transition. As I move toward completing my nearly 20-year tenure at American Tower, I am tremendously confident in three key respects: Tom's ability to lead our highly capable executive team and the business into a successful and prosperous future, the continuing vibrancy of our Stand and Deliver strategy and its ability to deliver strong performance and returns to our investors and that the ongoing demand drivers for mobile infrastructure will underpin strong growth for ATC for many years to come. Lastly, I would like to thank our investors and analysts, many of whom are on this call today, for your confidence in our team during the many years that I have been privileged to lead it. I fully expect that Tom will now lead the company, along the trajectory of our Stand and Deliver strategy, to even greater heights in the future. And now I'll turn it back over to Tom for some closing thoughts before we go to Q&A.\nTom Bartlett: Hey, thanks, Jim. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to first recognize our Board Chairman, Jim Taiclet, for his incredible leadership, judgment and friendship over these last 20 years. Over that period, our business has grown from operating in just three markets, generating about $1 billion in revenue with 15 sites to where we are today. That, in and of itself, is amazing and a testament to his leadership, but it's the way he has guided us and built this culture that, in my mind, will forever be his legacy and my compass for where we go from here. So Jim, I'd like to say on behalf of all your investors and employees, we thank you. Okay. Operator, please, now, let's open the lines for some Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: And congrats to Tom and Rod, well earned. And congrats, and thank you to Jim. It's obviously sad to see you go, but I do feel like this transition is natural and seamless, and I do think that it speaks volumes about the quality of the organization that you built and the legacy you leave behind. And so I'm going to take advantage of this opportunity to ask you one last question. When you and the Board were starting to design the company's expanded international strategy, which is, I don't know, 13, 14 years ago, you talked about a range of risks that the company was willing to take, a range of stresses that you thought you were designing your international operations to absorb. And while I'm certain you didn't anticipate this exact situation, I was hoping you can maybe remind us of those risk parameters, the stress points that you designed the business for so as we watch this pandemic unfold, we can assess for ourselves whether these changes are within scope or whether adjustments are going to need to be made.\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Brett, and thanks for your kind comments. I'll start it off and maybe turn it back over to Tom to speak of the plan ahead. But the range of risks that we anticipated was based on the fundamental risk we had at the time, which we were a single country, single-product company that had really large growth ambitions. And I think to risk mitigate that very high concentration in the U.S. tower market that we went on, as you described it, a 15-year sort of diversification plan. So we diversified among currencies, continents, countries, customers, markets, etcetera, to try to, as you would do, create a portfolio that grew over time that would mitigate risk and grow faster than otherwise we could have. And that's really the framework around what we've been doing for all that time since 2007 or so. So I think within that context, I could let Tom describe how he and perhaps Rod thinks that this can play out given the COVID-19. I think it's still within our framework, frankly, Brett. But let me ask Tom to comment.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Jim. And thanks, Brett, as well for the comments. I think, as Jim said, I mean, what kind of supports and underwrites the overall international strategy is it's the same business model as we have in the United States. It's not a new set of products and services. And so it allows us to take the model that we built in the United States in terms of how we look at an infrastructure, how we actually look at the master lease agreements and being able to take that offshore into those large, emerging market economies to be able to drive growth. The other piece that Jim talked about was the diversification. We underwrite these investments operationally, which I'll spend a minute some thoughts on it in a minute, but it's a very diversified portfolio. And so we are scattered around in 19 markets, 18 of which are outside of the United States. And we also think that, that serves as a useful way for us to be able to kind of underwrite the risk. The third is we're large incumbents. Our customers are the largest telecommunications companies around the world. So it's we're not dealing with consumers. We're not dealing with a number of small players. These are the large AT&Ts and Verizons outside of out of the United States. And operationally, when we look at the investments themselves, we're looking at them over a very long period of time, so we have a 10-year discounted cash flow, and we underwrite them with a risk-adjusted cost of capital. So we are caring for a lot of the risks that you would normally see. And they have escalators in them that are CPI based, utilizing local debt, reinvesting that cash back into the business. And so we think if we're able to do this in a very balanced way, a very diversified way, we're going to be able to successfully enjoy the growth that we're seeing from these markets that, as you all know, are anywhere from three to five years behind the U.S. from a technology perspective. So we think that's a sound approach, a balanced approach, again, to being able to kind of leverage all the opportunity we see offshore.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Tom, I'd like to just add one more point. We still got about 2/3 or more of the cash flow coming from the U.S. So it's grown just as rapidly. In fact, as the international has on a cash flow basis all for that 15-year period. So there wasn't so much risk mitigation that we ended up with, which was really turbocharging growth and keeping a similar risk profile based on diversification.\nTom Bartlett: Jim, if I could just add a couple of comments there in terms of our ability to build new assets in these international markets. When we build new assets, those are our highest yielding investments and we've been able to build a lot of assets around the globe, more than 4,000 sites last year. And this year, we expect to build even more than that. So it's a way for us to kind of expand our horizon and be able to deploy significant capital in the most productive way possible.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Morning, guys. Well, the world certainly has changed -the world has certainly changed in the last two months since your 4Q call. First, I'm glad to hear, and I hope your family, you and your employees stay safe in this crazy time. I'll add my comments to say, Jim, I remember that non-deal road show in San Francisco. Must be almost 20 years ago as you were starting. And the world was in chaos then too, so you guys have navigated very strongly. And echo congrats to Tom and Rod as well. From a business standpoint, obviously, another thing that's changed is Sprint and T-Mobile merger has closed, finally. Dish-Boost might be closing soon. How should we think about the timing of working with them in what's going to be a very complicated process of integrating networks? Do we think of MLAs? Do we think of holistic approaches? And how long do those, generically speaking, how long does it take to kind of work through these complicated master lease agreements?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Rick, I think with - first of all, thank you for your comments and your thoughts. T-Mobile and Sprint have been working and thinking about, I think, their network deployment plans for some time now. So now that the deal is, in fact, closed, we're now able to sit down with them in a meaningful way to talk about a number of different contractual structures with them. I mean, to this point, we've seen some level of increase in the pipeline, but it's still awaiting the bulk really of what we would expect to eventually come through as they ramp up their network deployments. And so we would expect that, as we said, more in the second half of the year to start up some of the more significant volumes. But these are multiyear master lease agreements that master lease agreement structurally that we would put in place. Clearly, we would entertain one of our traditional holistic agreements, where we think it makes sense for us, as well as makes sense for T-Mobile and Sprint. But I think you could be assured that there are significant conversations going on as we speak. T-Mobile is very anxious to get going in terms of being able to meet a lot of their network commitments, and they'll be very aggressive, I am sure. And we are very much committed to being there. And we'll want to tailor the MLA to really be mutually advantaged to both of us. And so that kind of those events will be going on heavily, I would suspect, over the next 60 to 90 days. \nRic Prentiss: Great. And Jim, you mentioned your CEO panel committee in India U.S., India jointly working together on the COVID-19, great effort. Any updated thoughts on when the pacing of the payments and the AGR issue in India might be resolved? I'm seeing COVID-19 has kind of put things on a back burner. But I know we get a question a lot of times about when will the carriers know the pacing of that payment. any thoughts?\nTom Bartlett: Ric, just as an update. I think as Rod really mentioned, I mean, the process has largely been put on hold as have so many things as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. And so my sense is that I mean, and they're on, as you know, full lockdown in the country itself. So it's really status quo as we sit right now. We anticipate in the second half of the year there'll be further hearings to discuss the payment time line for dues and things like that. But everything is really on hold at this point in time.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. Again, I'll close with thoughts and hopes and prayers of everybody's family and employees make it through this crazy time. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Ric.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Ric, and you too.\nJim Taiclet: Ric, thanks for your support, it's Jim, over those last 20 years and your deep understanding of our company. To underpin what Tom said on India very quickly, is that the telecommunication and digital infrastructure industry is one of the significant work streams of this group. And we've got great talent on both sides between American Tower. Sunil Mittal of Bharti Airtel is my sub-co-chair for the group on telecom and also Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who's my co-chair for the entire effort in India with Tata. We have really made some great progress on telecom. In general, we've gotten it on the top shelf of the government of India's consideration to strengthen this industry. And I think the AGR resolution will ultimately be included in how that industry has strengthened. That is becoming increasingly important during this crisis as you can imagine there as it is here.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you, morning. I also want to extend my congratulations and thanks to Jim, as well as congratulations to Tom and Rod on their new roles. Maybe taking a step back you're welcome. Taking a step back to some of the comments you discussed on expanding the addressable market for revenue, and this is something that the company has been looking at for quite some time. Is there a way to just further put some numbers on the long-term opportunities to expand revenue, whether it's pushing the cloud to the edge with your towers, leveraging CBRS within the DAS strategy and potentially augmenting that and maybe some of the other initiatives that you've been pursuing in the international market?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No, thanks, Michael, and thanks for your congratulations as well. We did set out revenue goals internally, and we've actually talked about them externally, that within a 10-year period, and this is goals that we actually set back in 2017. We would generate probably incremental $1.5 billion from innovation-related events and activities. And fundamentally, there are really two principal elements of those innovation initiatives. First of all, it'll be utilizing exclusive real estate rights and would be multi-tenant. So very much related to our existing tower business. If you kind of step back and you think about our innovation strategy, it's really based upon, again, this neutral multi-tenant connectivity platform, as I'll refer to it, with our own stack that includes exclusive real estate, passive infrastructure, power, transport, compute layers, and again, I refer to that as kind of as our ATC stack on our existing or on a new platform that we are currently building, platform ATC, if you will. I'm not a marketing guy, Michael, but platform ATC. So everything that we're trialing from our edge computing initiatives, power initiatives, our in-building initiatives, the ones that you were referring to, and the kind of the multitude of international access and transport initiatives, they're largely fiber based, are really meant to be constructive as we really build out this stack, if you will, on this platform. So it's not a vertical point solution, but really a broad kind of a horizontal platform, if you will, capable of providing really a myriad of connectivity services. So if you think about 2020, we have three or four kind of major initiatives going on, again, building out this stack, if you will, this platform, if you will. And the first one is what you referred to, is kind of building out our in-building capabilities. We're trying to drive down the traditional DAS costs that we've developed and segment that we've developed over the last 20 years. And we're really trying to open it up to increase the overall TAM. So we're using CBRS spectrum and really opportunities to increase the tendency as well as increase the offload from our customers. We're also trying to more fully develop what we call our transport layer of the stack. And we're looking at fiber to the curb shared initiatives to really facilitate multiservice providers, and we're doing that largely down in Latin America. You also referred to, and we're doing additional work on developing and exploring our edge-based distributed compute and mobile edge computing opportunities. And I mentioned some of those in my remarks, but we're really trying to leverage our Colo Atl [ph] asset in certain sites in our U.S. portfolio. And finally, kind of rounding it out, we're really trying to improve our overall power layer of the stack. We continue to develop a hybrid shared power solution really using historical diesel-fueled generator power with new lower-cost solar and battery packs. So it's a bit of a double click on many of the initiatives. But clearly, we're at the early stages of the development of this stack, if you will. But we do think, again, it's a very effective way to look at our ability to leverage our existing core set of assets and to be able to offer new types of services to existing customers as well as to new types of customers around the globe. So we'll talk more broadly about that. I think on an upcoming call, our second or third quarter call where we take a deeper dive into a lot of the innovation initiatives. But we're well on our way, and we're very focused and we're doing it, I think, very efficiently. We're not throwing money against the wall here, if you will, in terms of building it out. We're being very focused but we're and we're, as you know, I think we have a CTO that we brought in a couple of years ago that is really providing an overall oversight on these overall initiatives that we have. So as I said, more to come, and we'll feel this back even further in a couple of quarters.\nRod Smith: And Tom, if I could just add a couple of, I'm sorry, Michael, can I just add a couple of things to what Tom outlined? So I would just add that the strength and resilience of our underlying business really does help support our ability to be inquisitive and opportunistic when it comes to innovation. So our strong and kind of consistent adjusted EBITDA margins, north of 63%, are consistent double-digit revenue growth and the fact that our return on invested capital was north of 11%. That strength in the core underlying business, combined with our very strong balance sheet, again, the liquidity position that we're in at $5.2 billion and pretty low cost of debt at 3.1%, that balance sheet strength is ready to go to work and really does support our ability to be inquisitive when it comes to innovation.\nMichael Rollins: Just a quick follow-up. Is there a risk that the activity in the bookings pick up in the back half of the year, as you described, but there are labor constraints to actually get the infrastructure on to all of the sites and so therefore, there could be the possibility of an elongated book-to-bill cycle entering into 2021?\nTom Bartlett: Michael, sure. I mean, that could always be. We haven't seen that necessarily. We're obviously given kind of the essential ticket, so we're able to be out at the sites, but it could be effective on or could affect our build-to-suit program. For example, we've actually come back a bit on the build-to-suit program. We think that those sites will ultimately be deployed, but the timing could be affected by construction personnel from being out of the site. And we are considered essential personnel. So we think that we won't see significant delays there. But as this continues to go along and if it intensifies, sure, that could delay some of the growth that we see in business. But more specifically, I think it's around build-to-suit.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Tom, I would just add, I think from an industry leadership position, we were - I think, instrumental with business roundtable in the U.S., the U.S.-India CEO Forum, therefore, in India, to get us in both countries that critical infrastructure designation, not only for our own company, but for our suppliers. And that still needs to be worked through a little bit more deeply in India. But in the U.S., I think it's pretty effective right now. So I expect, Mike, that we'll have a fairly capable vendor force available to us as well our carrier customers as a result of some of that leadership.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. And this brings a good point. I mean, one of our initial thoughts was would there be some issues from a supply chain perspective, and it's not necessarily bringing in big radios and things like antennas in, but it's usually that $0.50 part that might get in the way of actually deploying infrastructure. And we haven't seen that at this point in time, but and we don't anticipate it. But as I said, if this continues on, we think we're in a good spot, but and our customers are in a good spot, but time will tell.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nSpencer Kurn: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to inquire about the M&A landscape. In periods of dislocation well, first of all, have you seen any better valuations on some international portfolios in this current dislocation? And I was hoping you could elaborate on your experience in prior periods of market turmoil. Have you found that these are these present opportunities for you to expand more rapidly than you've been able to in periods where markets are tight?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No, Spencer. We always are looking at opportunities, M&A opportunities. As you know, we have business development teams around the globe. And it's a fairly lengthy number of opportunities that are out there, if you will. Whether they're COVID-19 related or not, there continue to be a lot of assets out there up for sale. Back in the 2008, 2009 time frame, there was a significant amount of growth. There were companies that were just distressed and looking to monetize their assets. And we actually were pretty aggressive back at the time and picked up some sizable assets. And so we'll see. I think we're in still early stages, if you will, in terms of the pandemic, in terms of its impacting a particular company's financial position. As Rod mentioned before, we have a sizable liquidity position at this point in time. So I think we're really well positioned to be opportunistic here. But we'll go back to our fundamental investment policy and the way we look at deals, and we'll continue to manage it and monitor it that way. And so time will tell. We just closed two transactions at the end of last year, which we're currently integrating and it's going very well. And so we'll continue to see how the year pans out. But as I said, I think we're in a good financial position to be able to strike at some of these to the extent they become available and make sense to us.\nSpencer Kurn: Great, thank you.\nRod Smith: Sure.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Let me go everyone else's sentiments. Congrats, Jim, on a successful career and congrats, Tom and Rod, on your guys' elevation. I guess the question I want to ask you is the question I've been getting from a lot of investors, which is what is Tom Bartlett's American Tower going to look like in five years versus how Jim Taiclet's American Tower might have looked? Where is your ambition? What is your strategic goal? Jim, a few years ago, came up with this idea that you wanted to double the size of the company and achieve that goal. What are you ready? Are you able to articulate kind of what your vision now for the company might be and how that might be similar or different from the vision that we've kind of all understood American Tower has? And then let me just ask that.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No. Thanks, David, and thanks for your congrats as well. We've got an excellent strategic and tactical blueprint that I believe that's in place that Jim and I, and the rest of my colleagues that we developed and that we're currently executing. We refer to it as is our Stand and Deliver strategy. And as you know, there are four key elements of it. There's industry leadership. There's a focused innovation process, one that I just talked about a few minutes ago. It's enhancing our efficiency initiatives. And it's a continuing drive for growth, profitable growth, sustainable growth, both organically and inorganically. I think that the way we have consistently thought about creating shareholder value based upon sound principles, around capital allocation and investment criteria, our dividend policy, the way we manage our balance sheet, is absolutely sound. So I mean, I don't see any changes to the way that we've been operating the business, and clearly, no changes to the blueprint that we really have in place. I think that the existing team is outstanding. And so now it's up to us to continue to execute. Will we adjust it and tweak it as the market evolves? Absolutely, as we have continually doing. And as we have done over the last 10, 15 years, if we need to, just, as I say, just as we always have. But the fundamentals are solid. I mean, I don't have any grandiose notions that, okay, we're going to be a $20 billion business by 2025. If that happens, terrific. But we're just going to continue to keep our heads down, really move on the strategy that we've got in place. I think that there are as I was talking a few minutes ago, I think there are a lot of really interesting elements of our innovation strategy, which I think are going to increase the overall addressable market that we're going to be able to take our fair share of. And we're going to continue to globalize. We're a very good and very big international business. I think that there are opportunities for us to continue to globalize, particularly when you look at some centralized global business, operational centers that we have. And so I think there are a lot of things that we can do on the efficiency side. And on the leadership side, Jim is really he's got big shoes to fill on the leadership side, and I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to really push the envelope in terms of how we're positioned in all the markets that we're in. But when you kind of step back and you look at our inventory, we own about 1/3 of the inventory the assets, if you will, of the 20 market, 19 markets that we're in. So there's a lot of opportunity for inorganic growth. And I think we've got a great business model to enjoy organic growth going forward. So I think we've got the fundamental pieces in place. As I said, we'll tweak it and adjust it based upon where the market is and how the market evolves. But feel very good about the blueprint that we've got in place.\nJim Taiclet: And David, to bring it full circle, when we embarked on our international strategy in '07, it actually positioned us to have, as the circle closed in, say, 2017 through 2025, it gave us the opportunity to potentially expand our U.S. domestic business because our innovation program could then kick in over the U.S. and our international portfolios. It gave us a character that no other tower company in the world has, where we can work with new types of customers like hyperscalers, like big real estate owners that span countries. And we're the only one that can take that dimension of an innovation program on digital infrastructure and circle it back to the United States and maybe even grow faster here over the coming years than we otherwise would have without the Stand and Deliver strategy in the international assets, David. So I think there's some real blue skies here for Tom and the team to pursue under the strategy. And I agree that I don't perceive any big deviations from that based on the fact that this is the same exact team that put the strategy together and executed it for 12-plus years with the people on the call we have right now. So I think we're going to be having really exciting times at ATC going forward.\nDavid Barden: That's great. Thank you for that, Jim. Appreciate it. And look, everybody.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks again.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good morning. Let me add my congratulations and best wishes to the team. On the mobile edge compute, can maybe you can just give us some sense of what you're seeing in the current market environment. We've seen strong demand for interconnection, etcetera, in the COVID world. What's going on with the Colo business you have today? And as you think about taking advantage of that opportunity, do you think you need to add additional assets more across the country and in other markets to expand that on that opportunity?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No. Thanks, Simon, and thanks for your congrats as well. I think when you kind of step back and you take a look at our overall edge computing initiatives, I'd really look at it in kind of two pieces. First of all, from a pure distribution or distributed compute perspective, those are aware we've actually had some early-on successes, and this is where we're actually putting cages out at our particular sites. And we're offering edge computing to enterprise, smaller enterprise, midsized enterprise accounts, where they're looking to perhaps move to the public cloud and just looking for some of their workloads to being more distributed. So that's the kind of the easy element and the easy piece that I think we've experienced. And then the second, more complicated piece, candidly, is on the kind of traditional mobile edge computing. And I see this from a number of different elements. I see this from the data center side, we're obviously looking at it from the hyperscaler side. And this is where we're looking at the opportunity for lower latency types of needs that we think are going to be ultimately developing out at the edge and how we might be able to participate in that. And so we have, as you know, the Colo Atl facility that we picked up a couple of or last year, really. And we're looking to interconnect that offering and kind of access to the cloud and trying to interconnect it back to our own sites themselves with the compute power that we're putting out at the sites to see what that ecosystem, if you will, looks like. I don't actually know how this is all ultimately going to pan out. I don't know the relationships that we're going to see with the hyperscalers as well as with the carriers. We see a lot of initiatives going on between Amazon and Google and Azure in terms of how they're looking at the C-RAN and how they're working with AT&T and Verizon and getting further and further out to the edge. We think that we have some very valuable assets that can be part of that overall solution. And we're looking to be able to kind of leverage the assets that we have to be able to support that. But this is going to be something that, as I mentioned before, it's going to take a while to figure out how to scale. I don't think that without the kind of the whole vehicle element here, with all the IoT element here that it's really going to be something that we can scale efficiently. But that's probably three to five years away. And so we're participating in a number of different trials. As I said, we're taking advantage of this kind of distributed compute capability, and we're trying to figure out how we might fit into the overall mobile edge computing environment going forward. So more to come on that. But as I said, I think we've got some very valuable assets there that can play a meaningful role in some way.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. please go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Great, thank you. And also just want to extend my congratulations to everyone. I guess, just my first question, you had mentioned some counterparty risk in India. I'm just curious if there's any other areas that you think we should be paying attention to or that you're paying attention to, particularly in the COVID-19 environment. And I guess somewhat related, you mentioned in the international markets, at least, right now, you're actually seeing increased usage, particularly in countries where their wireline networks aren't as strong. Do you think that, that will ultimately translate into incremental revenue? Are you starting to have those conversations now? Although on the opposite side of things, do you actually think that given some of the economic pressures that some of those international markets are going to be seeing, we could actually start to see the opposite where they actually start to pull back on some of their Investments? Just trying to get a better sense of what's winning out.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Colby, on that particular question, I think because of the lack of the wireline presence, I think the governments themselves are going to continue to put pressure on the carriers themselves to ensure that their connectivity continues. And as Jim said, we've been on to some tables with WEF and talking with some of our customers there. I mean, they're all essential and they're incredibly important in terms of ensuring that their customers are connected, particularly with this disease that is so isolationary. So yes, I think that, that demand is going to continue there. As Rod kind of walked through some of our growth rates, we're looking at kind of that 7% to 8% growth rate in Latin America and up in the high single-digit growth rate in Africa. So we're - I believe that, that kind of the growth is actually going to continue. There will there be issues associated with collections and delays and things like that, internet? We haven't seen it, candidly. But to the extent that this continues, sure, that can always be something that we'll that we might see. But we're monitoring it closely. We have obviously, very close relationships with our customers. Our infrastructure is critical to their ability to be able to continue to meet the needs of their customers. So I think we'll be able to manage through that. But we're monitoring it, and we'll watch it very closely and work with our customers to be able to, for all of us, to be able to get through this pandemic. On your first question, could there be delays in organic growth, and we've mentioned some of the delays in the build-to-suit program, the collections issues that we're seeing in India, we've been managing and monitoring those for many years. And so we're working again with our customers. We have an incredible management team in place there who have really terrific relationships with our customers. And so we'll work with them. But ultimately, I think we're in a good position, again, kind of given the critical nature of our infrastructure and that being infrastructure that's really going to allow us all if you kind of get through this pandemic itself.\nRod Smith: And then Tom, if I can just add one additional point on the collections issue in India, Colby, that you raised. So when we think about our customer base globally, it is a very strong customer base, large multinational carriers, most of which are investment-grade carriers. When you look at our collections, and when you go through the press release and you see the increase in our accounts receivable, the vast majority of that increase comes from India. In India, I'll point to one customer in particular, which is BSNL, which is a government-owned entity, and that entity has a long history of paying their bills. So we do expect that when the government funding comes through and that could be impacted because of the COVID-19 situation in India, when that comes through, we do expect that those receivables will be paid through that customer. Again, our local teams in India that have a very close relationship with BSNL, they've been through this before. That carrier pays their bills from time to time. They do have to wait for government funding, however.\nColby Synesael: Great, thank you.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Colby [ph]. I think we have time for one more question. Operator,\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Appreciate you guys squeezing me in. A couple of three questions. Can you guys quantify for us the backlog in terms of new lease applications that are signed but not on air in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis? And maybe some color on how that trajectory has maybe changed through April here after T-Mobile closed? Second, can you give us what the kicker was on the MLA from AT&T this quarter that may not repeat in the second quarter? And third, maybe just a bigger picture question on 5G. Have you seen enough from your customers for you to see what like a standard configuration that they're going to put up for 5G and what that might mean from an amendment standpoint in the U.S.?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Sure, Brad. Let me take the kind of the 5G question, and then I'll ask Rod to kind of manage through the other myriad questions that you asked here. On the 5G side, I think all the carriers themselves, as I mentioned, have taken kind of their own unique approach to being able to deploy it. I mean, if you take a look at Verizon on the millimeter wave, they're in 34 cities, 17 NFL stadiums. On the sub-6, they're talking about using dynamic spectrum sharing, no stated time lines. AT&T in the millimeter, they deployed 5G in, I think, roughly 35 cities. They're adding new 5G cities this year. They have a sizable amount of millimeter-wave spectrum as well. And then in the sub-6, they're providing 5G in, I think, upwards of 100 markets using kind of low-band 5G. And T-Mobile have also taken a very different approach, largely leveraging their sub-6 spectrum now with Sprint with their 2.5 gig kind of sitting on top of a lot of their 600 megahertz spectrum, but they also have a sizable amount of millimeter-wave spectrum. So I think all of the carriers have taken very different approaches. All ultimately will be circling around kind of this 3-level layer cake, as I've talked about before, where it's at the very base level, kind of the sub-2 gigahertz level, good propagation, limited capacity, but really, it'd be able to get kind of nationwide coverage. The mid-band, which we've talked about, the CBRS and C band, which we think will ultimately be auctioned off this year, improved capacity, lower propagation. And then the millimeter wave, and they'll look at millimeter wave as being that spectrum that you use for dense urban and urban markets. So I think the carriers themselves, as they've always had, are going to leverage the spectrum that they have. They're going to try to put their hands on more spectrum, as they always have, to be able to come up with this kind of this 3-level approach to being able to deploy 5G. And as I said, it's I think it's on our doorstep. And we'll be seeing it over the next several years get built out. I think some of the forecasts are saying that by 2025 or 2026, 70-some-odd percent of the traffic will be 5G based. So I just think they're going to continue to look at various forms of spectrum, and it's the propagation characteristics are very different, as you well know, but they'll take advantage given the kind of geography that they're looking to support. And Rod on the other?\nRod Smith: Yes. Sure, Tom. So thanks for the question, Brandon, and I'll address the organic growth and what we expect kind of going forward. So if you look at our Q1 earnings, we came in for organic tenant billings growth, the total company was about 5.4%. U.S. was about 5.6%. International came in at 5.1%. If you look at our outlook for the full year, we're expecting total organic tenant billings growth to be about 5%. In the U.S., we expect it to be about 5%. And internationally, we also expect it to be about 5%. So certainly from that perspective, we do expect a kind of a deceleration in those growth rates throughout the quarter. So I do think you'll see that in the first quarter here, we'll post the highest organic tenant billings growth compared to the next three quarters for the year in order to come down to hit those full year organic tenant billings growth rates that we talked about. Of course, those organic tenant billings growth, I guess, I would point out, Brandon, that a big contributor to the organic tenant billing this year is what happened last year. So we still see a good level of activity coming in for the year. The timing of when that activity comes in is a little bit there's a timing issue between quarters, particularly when you think about some of our larger U.S. customers that are under MLA agreements, where the timing of their increases on a quarterly basis could certainly isn't smooth. So we end up, which is a good thing for us, with a bump in Q1, which gives us a full year benefit for a lot of those increases. But in the next few quarters, we will have a lower increase, but it doesn't that won't necessarily be able to translate into lower activity or lower demand for the site. It's really just the timing of the new business increases as per our large MLAs. So I think that's kind of, in a nutshell, without going too much further into individual customers. We do expect a deceleration. I think if you look at our organic tenant billings growth rates and our outlook, we're going to come in right around those levels. That's our best guess at this point. And again, when you see that deceleration, it's not because of a drop in activity levels. It's really mostly driven by the timing of some of the increases for our MLAs.\nTom Bartlett: Great. Thank you, everybody, for being with us this morning. I know we went a little bit late, but I really do appreciate you hanging in there with us. And again, as we've all said, be safe, really, in this environment and keep your family safe, social distance and be well and look forward to catching up with you. Thanks, again.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Rod, and good morning, everyone. To each of you on the call today, I wish you and yours a safe and healthy path to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Tom stated earlier, our top priority in American Tower is the health and safety of our global workforce. Our dedicated employees and managers throughout the company are committed to keeping critical telecommunications infrastructure fully operational and functional in their communities. The senior executive team and management throughout ATC are doing everything they can to support our global teams in this essential work. Our company is also contributing to those communities financially through our philanthropy and CSR programs and through the American Tower Foundation. This includes everything from working in Boston, Massachusetts with local and state support funds for citizens in need, to funding and donating PPE to health workers throughout the U.S., to helping with the government of India's COVID-19 recovery fund and many more. In addition, Commerce Secretary Ross and I have agreed to immediately pivot the entire near-term work effort of the U.S.-India CEO Forum, which we co-chair, toward COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts in the world's two largest democracies. We are fully engaged with the GOI and our Indian counterpart companies in this effort. As ATC's Executive Chairman, I have been offering guidance regarding our COVID-19 response, while also working very closely with Tom to ensure a smooth and seamless management transition. As I move toward completing my nearly 20-year tenure at American Tower, I am tremendously confident in three key respects: Tom's ability to lead our highly capable executive team and the business into a successful and prosperous future, the continuing vibrancy of our Stand and Deliver strategy and its ability to deliver strong performance and returns to our investors and that the ongoing demand drivers for mobile infrastructure will underpin strong growth for ATC for many years to come. Lastly, I would like to thank our investors and analysts, many of whom are on this call today, for your confidence in our team during the many years that I have been privileged to lead it. I fully expect that Tom will now lead the company, along the trajectory of our Stand and Deliver strategy, to even greater heights in the future. And now I'll turn it back over to Tom for some closing thoughts before we go to Q&A. Sure, Brett, and thanks for your kind comments. I'll start it off and maybe turn it back over to Tom to speak of the plan ahead. But the range of risks that we anticipated was based on the fundamental risk we had at the time, which we were a single country, single-product company that had really large growth ambitions. And I think to risk mitigate that very high concentration in the U.S. tower market that we went on, as you described it, a 15-year sort of diversification plan. So we diversified among currencies, continents, countries, customers, markets, etcetera, to try to, as you would do, create a portfolio that grew over time that would mitigate risk and grow faster than otherwise we could have. And that's really the framework around what we've been doing for all that time since 2007 or so. So I think within that context, I could let Tom describe how he and perhaps Rod thinks that this can play out given the COVID-19. I think it's still within our framework, frankly, Brett. But let me ask Tom to comment. Yes. And Tom, I'd like to just add one more point. We still got about 2/3 or more of the cash flow coming from the U.S. So it's grown just as rapidly. In fact, as the international has on a cash flow basis all for that 15-year period. So there wasn't so much risk mitigation that we ended up with, which was really turbocharging growth and keeping a similar risk profile based on diversification. Ric, thanks for your support, it's Jim, over those last 20 years and your deep understanding of our company. To underpin what Tom said on India very quickly, is that the telecommunication and digital infrastructure industry is one of the significant work streams of this group. And we've got great talent on both sides between American Tower. Sunil Mittal of Bharti Airtel is my sub-co-chair for the group on telecom and also Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who's my co-chair for the entire effort in India with Tata. We have really made some great progress on telecom. In general, we've gotten it on the top shelf of the government of India's consideration to strengthen this industry. And I think the AGR resolution will ultimately be included in how that industry has strengthened. That is becoming increasingly important during this crisis as you can imagine there as it is here. Yes. And Tom, I would just add, I think from an industry leadership position, we were - I think, instrumental with business roundtable in the U.S., the U.S.-India CEO Forum, therefore, in India, to get us in both countries that critical infrastructure designation, not only for our own company, but for our suppliers. And that still needs to be worked through a little bit more deeply in India. But in the U.S., I think it's pretty effective right now. So I expect, Mike, that we'll have a fairly capable vendor force available to us as well our carrier customers as a result of some of that leadership. And David, to bring it full circle, when we embarked on our international strategy in '07, it actually positioned us to have, as the circle closed in, say, 2017 through 2025, it gave us the opportunity to potentially expand our U.S. domestic business because our innovation program could then kick in over the U.S. and our international portfolios. It gave us a character that no other tower company in the world has, where we can work with new types of customers like hyperscalers, like big real estate owners that span countries. And we're the only one that can take that dimension of an innovation program on digital infrastructure and circle it back to the United States and maybe even grow faster here over the coming years than we otherwise would have without the Stand and Deliver strategy in the international assets, David. So I think there's some real blue skies here for Tom and the team to pursue under the strategy. And I agree that I don't perceive any big deviations from that based on the fact that this is the same exact team that put the strategy together and executed it for 12-plus years with the people on the call we have right now. So I think we're going to be having really exciting times at ATC going forward. Thanks again."

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining. Before I dive into our first quarter results, I'd like to also take a moment and acknowledge the COVID-19 pandemic that is affecting all of us. My thoughts and best wishes go out to our employees, tenants, vendors and to each of you on the call this morning. I hope you all are safe and healthy through this difficult time. Let's now turn to our first quarter results. As you saw in today's press release, we began 2020 with a solid quarter, as mobile data consumption continued to grow across the globe. In fact, in many of our markets, particularly internationally, mobile data traffic has increased as a result of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of wireless services everywhere and the critical nature of our global portfolio of communications real estate. To start, I'd like to note a few of our first quarter achievements. Specifically, we met our expectations for organic tenant billings growth rates across the globe, led by Africa at 9.3%, Latin America at 7.5% and the U.S. at 5.6%. We grew our property revenue in tenant billings by more than 10%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 230 basis points over the prior year. We made substantial progress integrating the more than 8,000 sites we acquired at the end of 2019 in Africa and Latin America. We've built approximately 1,000 new sites. We strengthened our balance sheet and now have $5.4 billion of liquidity pro forma for our new term loan from earlier this month. And we grew our common stock dividend by 20% again. Before we discuss the details of our full year outlook, let's first spend a few minutes reviewing our financial and operational results for the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 8, and we will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. For the quarter, you can see that our underlying growth remains solid throughout our markets. Due to strong demand for our assets across the globe and on an FX-neutral basis, we met our internal expectations for revenue. As Igor mentioned earlier, our first quarter consolidated property revenue of approximately $1,970,000,000, grew by $187 million or 10.5% over Q1 of last year. This included a headwind of roughly $48 million from unfavorable FX translations. Our U.S. segment represented 55% of both our consolidated property revenue and the corresponding growth, while our international segments accounted for the remaining 45%. As always has been the case, the critical components of our consolidated property revenue are those items that impact our recurring tenant billings revenue, including around $79 million in colocations and amendments, a similar level to prior quarters. Our consistent and reliable contractual escalators, which added $50 million, our day one incremental tenant billings resulting from our returns-based and disciplined capital investments, which contributed $72 million and includes M&A and new builds. These positive items were partially offset by lease non-renewals or churn, which reduced our tenant billings revenue by $49 million for the quarter. Looking at our major business segments; our U.S. property segment revenue totaled nearly $1.1 billion for the quarter and grew by $104 million or 10.5% over the prior year period. Our international property revenue of $883 million grew by $84 million or 10.5% over last year's levels. As expected, we saw solid demand from our major carrier tenants around the globe. This demand was driven by the carriers' need to continually invest in their networks in order to keep pace with the exploding growth in mobile data consumption. Moving to the right side of the slide, you will see that our consolidated organic tenant billings growth also met our expectations, coming in at 5.4% for the quarter. For our U.S. property segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6%, comprised of new business activity, which totaled 4.5%; pricing escalators, which totaled 3.3%; and churn of 2%; and a roughly 0.3% negative impact from other items, which partially offset the items I mentioned above. As expected, this growth rate reflects a deceleration from prior quarters, partially driven by the impact of the pending Sprint, T-Mobile merger had on new business activity levels. Now that the merger has closed, we stand ready to support the new T-Mobile as it begins to invest significant capital and to perform the earnest work of integrating two complex networks, deploying diverse spectrum holdings and servicing more than 100 million subscribers, all while preparing for a 5G future. Regarding our international segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1%, led by Africa at more than 9% and Latin America at 7.5%. Europe totaled just about 2%, while India came in with a decline of around 1%, which was in line with our expectations, given anticipated churn and market conditions. The component parts of our international organic tenant billings growth were new business activity, which totaled 7%; our mostly local inflation-based pricing escalators, which totaled 3.6%; other items, which contributed around 20 basis points and partially offsetting these increases was churn of 5.8%, largely attributable to previously anticipated cancellations in India. Turning to slide nine. You can see our first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion grew by $157 million or 14.1% over the prior year period. As a result of our continued focus on driving organic growth, adding new assets and managing costs throughout our business, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.8% for the quarter, which was up 230 basis points compared to Q1 of last year. I will also note that these results include the impacts of around $16 million in incremental bad debt recorded in India due to some slow payments of accounts receivable from certain tenants, including government-owned BSNL. We think it's likely we will collect these receivables in the future, but for now, we have provided for them by increasing our bad debt reserves. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by approximately $26 million or 2.3% for FX fluctuations as compared to Q1 of last year. Our U.S. property segment operating profit of $858 million grew by $105 million or nearly 14% over the year-ago period, while our international property segment operating profit of $448 million grew by $62 million or 16% over last year's level. As a result, our U.S. segment represented 66% of our property segment operating profit in the quarter and 63% of the corresponding growth, while international accounted for the remaining 34% and 37%, respectively. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $907 million grew by $45 million or 5.3% over the year-ago period. Our consolidated AFFO per share of $2.03 grew by $0.09 or 4.6% over last year's levels. It is important to consider that the consolidated AFFO results include the impact of a onetime cash interest expense charge totaling $63 million as a result of our purchase of MTN's stake in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda. Absent this non-recurring charge, our consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share growth would have been 12.6% and 12.4%, respectively. As a reminder, we now expect a gap between consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to common stockholders to be modest in future years as a result of these minority stake purchases and our expected purchase of the remaining Tata stake in our India business, which is anticipated for later this year. Moving to Slide 10, let's now take a look at our updated expectations for 2020. To start, I will address a few of the business issues that require careful consideration as we updated our full year outlook. First and foremost is the COVID-19 pandemic. Although its full year impact on the world is not yet known, to date, on a constant currency basis, we have experienced only modest impacts. In fact, in many of our international markets, markets that have little or no fixed line infrastructure, our tenants are actually seeing increases in mobile data consumption across their networks, which may increase demand for our sites over time. As stated earlier, this highlights the world's growing reliance on wireless services and evidences the critical nature of our global portfolio of communications real estate. With that said, COVID-19 has caused global financial turmoil and material moves in many foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Of course, these FX moves are having a negative impact on our updated full year outlook. I'll discuss the detail of those impact shortly. But in the general context of the current FX volatility, I will note that we routinely review our hedging policies and often engage with the help of specialized external advisers in doing so. Although we have hedged purchase prices for certain international transactions in the past, historically, we have concluded that the potential benefit of actively hedging our ongoing translational FX exposure are not worth the real economic cost. Instead, we rely on natural hedges such as the portfolio effect of our '19 markets, our reinvestment of locally generated operating cash flow through new builds and M&A activity and select issuances of local currency debt. In addition, most of our tenant leases in international markets have annual local inflation-based escalators or are denominated in U.S. dollars. At this stage, we do not anticipate any significant changes in our approach to hedging, but as always, we continue to evaluate our options. Next, in the U.S., T-Mobile recently completed its merger with Sprint. As a result, we continue to anticipate an acceleration of spending from the new T-Mobile to begin in the second half of the year. In addition, beyond 2020, we believe this industry shift may result in a sustained increase in wireless industry capital spending as 5G deployments ramp and Dish supported its network. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from the future 5G deployments as carriers continue to focus on network quality. Finally, in India, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the fees, penalties and interest assessments associated with the previous ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenues. Although the total liability has been reaffirmed, we don't yet know the pacing and duration of the required payments on the part of the carriers, particularly in the context of the current COVID-19 situation. Taking these updated considerations and our assessment of market conditions into account and based on the proven resilience of our global business, our total property revenue outlook on a constant currency basis is unchanged. However, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as compared to our prior outlook are expected to negatively impact reported property revenues for the full year by approximately $300 million. For organic tenant billings growth, we are reiterating our outlook across most of our geographic segments. However, for Africa, we now expect organic tenant billings growth of around 9% for the year, down from 11% in our initial outlook. This is being driven by a reclassification of certain revenues out of tenant billings rather than a shift in the underlying fundamentals of our Africa business. Looking at Slide 11, you will see that we are also affirming our underlying expectations for adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our outlook outside of an FX translational impact of approximately $165 million. This includes the expectation that cash, SG&A as a percent of total revenue will be right around 8%. Lastly, we are reiterating our expectations for consolidated AFFO for the year on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to carefully manage our cash interest expense and cash taxes, while converting the vast majority of our cash adjusted EBITDA growth into consolidated AFFO growth. As a result, outside of roughly $140 million or $0.32 per share and unfavorable FX translation impacts, our consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share projections are unchanged. Although we are not surprised by how well our business has performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor events closely as the full impacts of this crisis develop. I would also note that to the extent that local market measures, like shelter-in-place orders are prolonged, we could eventually experience some timing issues regarding new business commencements, new builds or even accounts receivable collections. Flipping to Slide 12, I'd like to now briefly discuss our capital allocation plans for the year, which remain broadly consistent with our prior view. Our full year dividend declaration, subject to the approval of our Board, is expected to be approximately $2 billion, resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20% once again. We also expect to deploy $1.2 billion towards our CapEx program, with 85% of that investment being discretionary. As a result of COVID-19 and the associated FX impacts, we now expect a reduction of $50 million from our prior CapEx outlook. This includes a $30 million reduction in redevelopment CapEx, $5 million in lower maintenance CapEx and $15 million in lower development capital spending, in part due to a delay of construction of approximately 1,000 new builds in India. In the first quarter, we deployed $524 million to buy MTN's minority stakes in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda and have earmarked another $328 million at March 31, 2020, exchange rates for our pending purchase of Tata's remaining interest in our India business. In addition, we have spent roughly $49 million on other M&A so far this year and have deployed about $55 million through April 22 to share repurchases. Given our strong balance sheet and current liquidity, we expect to fund the entirety of our 2020 capital deployment plans with cash on hand, cash from operations and modest levels of revolver borrowings. We also expect to explore additional opportunities to extend and ladder our debt maturities and reduce our overall cost of borrowings. As a result, we anticipate continuing our long track record of generating strong consolidated AFFO per share growth, while simultaneously growing our return on invested capital. Turning now to Slide 13, I will briefly summarize the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our current liquidity position, which we believe is unmatched in our sector. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.3 billion in cash and $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed an additional one year term loan of nearly $1.2 billion, increasing our liquidity on a pro forma basis to more than $5 billion. Our net leverage at the end of the quarter was 4.6 times, in line with our targeted range and consistent with our historical levels. Our weighted average cost of debt was around 3.1%, and our weighted average debt tenor was over five years. Regarding our debt maturities for 2020, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced the redemption of our $750 million, 2.8% unsecured notes, leaving us with just $350 million in the remaining maturities this year. As a result of our prudent financial policies that have been implemented and enhanced over the last decade and the overall stability and resilience of our business, we believe we are in an extremely strong financial position amid the current market turmoil. We expect this to enable us to continue to be opportunistic with respect to investing and growth, including M&A opportunities on a global basis. If you would please turn to slide 14, I will conclude my comments with a brief summary. Despite the global pandemic, we had a good start to 2020 as we achieved solid organic tenant billings growth, expanded our margins and ROIC, started integrating the portfolios acquired at the end of 2019 and once again, increased our quarterly dividend by 20%. We further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet, increasing our current liquidity to $5.4 billion and positioning ourselves to comfortably fund our 2020 capital deployment plan, while expanding our global power portfolio through opportunistic M&A. And finally, outside of the translational FX impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our outlook remains largely unchanged, highlighting the critical nature of wireless services everywhere as mobile data consumption continues to grow at a dramatic pace across the globe. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Thanks, Ric. And Tom, if I could just add a couple of, I'm sorry, Michael, can I just add a couple of things to what Tom outlined? So I would just add that the strength and resilience of our underlying business really does help support our ability to be inquisitive and opportunistic when it comes to innovation. So our strong and kind of consistent adjusted EBITDA margins, north of 63%, are consistent double-digit revenue growth and the fact that our return on invested capital was north of 11%. That strength in the core underlying business, combined with our very strong balance sheet, again, the liquidity position that we're in at $5.2 billion and pretty low cost of debt at 3.1%, that balance sheet strength is ready to go to work and really does support our ability to be inquisitive when it comes to innovation. Sure. And then Tom, if I can just add one additional point on the collections issue in India, Colby, that you raised. So when we think about our customer base globally, it is a very strong customer base, large multinational carriers, most of which are investment-grade carriers. When you look at our collections, and when you go through the press release and you see the increase in our accounts receivable, the vast majority of that increase comes from India. In India, I'll point to one customer in particular, which is BSNL, which is a government-owned entity, and that entity has a long history of paying their bills. So we do expect that when the government funding comes through and that could be impacted because of the COVID-19 situation in India, when that comes through, we do expect that those receivables will be paid through that customer. Again, our local teams in India that have a very close relationship with BSNL, they've been through this before. That carrier pays their bills from time to time. They do have to wait for government funding, however. Thanks, Colby [ph]. I think we have time for one more question. Operator, Yes. Sure, Tom. So thanks for the question, Brandon, and I'll address the organic growth and what we expect kind of going forward. So if you look at our Q1 earnings, we came in for organic tenant billings growth, the total company was about 5.4%. U.S. was about 5.6%. International came in at 5.1%. If you look at our outlook for the full year, we're expecting total organic tenant billings growth to be about 5%. In the U.S., we expect it to be about 5%. And internationally, we also expect it to be about 5%. So certainly from that perspective, we do expect a kind of a deceleration in those growth rates throughout the quarter. So I do think you'll see that in the first quarter here, we'll post the highest organic tenant billings growth compared to the next three quarters for the year in order to come down to hit those full year organic tenant billings growth rates that we talked about. Of course, those organic tenant billings growth, I guess, I would point out, Brandon, that a big contributor to the organic tenant billing this year is what happened last year. So we still see a good level of activity coming in for the year. The timing of when that activity comes in is a little bit there's a timing issue between quarters, particularly when you think about some of our larger U.S. customers that are under MLA agreements, where the timing of their increases on a quarterly basis could certainly isn't smooth. So we end up, which is a good thing for us, with a bump in Q1, which gives us a full year benefit for a lot of those increases. But in the next few quarters, we will have a lower increase, but it doesn't that won't necessarily be able to translate into lower activity or lower demand for the site. It's really just the timing of the new business increases as per our large MLAs. So I think that's kind of, in a nutshell, without going too much further into individual customers. We do expect a deceleration. I think if you look at our organic tenant billings growth rates and our outlook, we're going to come in right around those levels. That's our best guess at this point. And again, when you see that deceleration, it's not because of a drop in activity levels. It's really mostly driven by the timing of some of the increases for our MLAs."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Igor, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and well. Typically, in our first quarter earnings call, we would talk exclusively about our U.S. business, and how it is positioned in the market. But given that there is nothing typical in the world in which we live today, I'd like to first discuss how we are navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, including its historical impact on the global economy. Our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers and surrounding communities. Most of our team members globally are working from home. To facilitate this, we bolstered our IT environment to support more remote work and established alternative business processes and solutions to overcome the need to have work accomplished from our office or at our established operational centers. We're practicing social distancing in a few instances where certain employees need to be in the office and have provided added equipment and supplies for those considered essential and needed to be out in our sites supporting our tenants. We're also in the process of establishing our overall guidelines and procedures for an eventual return to work in our offices across the globe. These guidelines will adhere to government directives and be supplemented by reasonable and practical criteria based on local situational needs and circumstances. The reopening process will be based on safety readiness levels and will not commence until I'm certain we have complete access to the necessary critical resources and supplies. I also want to emphasize that while immersed in all this activity and uncertainty, relative to just how long this crisis will last, we remain focused on continuing to meet the needs of our tenants. To that end, I want to note that to this point, the direct effects of the virus on our core business outside of translational FX impacts have been modest. While we're continually monitoring the COVID-19 impacts, our business model globally has demonstrated its resiliency and stability. Now more than ever, our infrastructure is incredibly critical to ensure our tenants are able to keep their customers connected. As a result, in many of our served markets, including the United States, we have received official priority designations that enable tower-related work to continue, largely uninterrupted. In a few locations, we have experienced some limitations and restrictions, particularly with respect to new builds and other discretionary tower work. In fact, in certain locations, new construction is currently prohibited. While these impacts have so far been modest, we do expect some slight delays in our new build pipeline and colocation activity in certain areas, but do believe these delays will be temporary. All in all, our business and operational focus will continue to be to prioritize actions, projects and capital allocation initiatives that extend, deepen and secure connectivity throughout our served markets. We are proud to help deliver meaningful connectivity to billions of people around the world at an important time like this and are focused on maintaining its continuity. This then brings me to the original topic I wanted to cover with you this morning, and that's of our business here in the United States. In 2020, at the midpoint of our outlook, our U.S. business is expected to represent about 57% of our consolidated property revenues and around 2/3 of our consolidated property operating profit. The U.S. operation is the foundation of our consolidated business and will continue to be for many years to come. Mobile data usage growth of at least 30% per year has driven significant levels of colocations and amendments on our U.S. assets over the last decade. And we expect that growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In fact, according to industry estimates, the average U.S. smartphone user consumed around nine gigabytes per month in 2019, which is up some 450% from just five years ago. Incredibly, by 2025, that same user is projected to consume over 45 gigabytes per month. To account for the strain that this usage growth will create on mobile networks, we believe that our tenants will continue to invest significant amounts of capital into our infrastructure. Over the last five years, this spending has averaged upwards of $30 billion per year. In fact, it's increased over the past 20 years as each new technology generation has been deployed, dating back to 2G. And we would expect that number to remain steady, if not rise, over the next few years, particularly given the recent completion of the Sprint, T-Mobile merger. A significant portion of our tenants' network investments in future years is expected to be 5G focused. And I'll take some time to cover our latest high-level thoughts around 5G and what that might mean for our business in a moment. But first, I'd like to spend a few minutes laying out the key characteristics and return profile of our U.S. business. Our U.S. portfolio, comprised of nearly 41,000 sites, has been created over the last 20-plus years through a number of M&A transactions, complemented by our internal new build program. We've consistently focused on sites with premier locations, significant capacity for lease-up, attractive land lease arrangements and modest requirements for ongoing maintenance CapEx. Perhaps the single biggest driver of value in these assets over the long-term has been the tenant lease contracts or master lease agreements that accompany them, which we have purposely designed to both deliver compelling value to the tenant and secure attractive economics for American Tower. Our requirement for exclusive franchise real estate locations in mission-critical areas has supported our ability to implement these contract structures to generate a consistent, recurring, growing base of cash flow. As you can see on Slide 6, that focus on tower and other franchise real estate assets has resulted in sustained attractive organic tenant billings growth for American Tower, averaging more than 6% over the past five years. The combination of strong colocation and amendment trends, annual contractual escalators and consistently low churn in the U.S. have been key drivers of this growth, as we've capitalized on the deployment and densification of 4G networks across the country. We've translated this strong organic tenant billings growth into attractive NOI yields across our portfolio, particularly for assets that we've owned over the long-term. For example, we're generating yields of 24% on sites we owned prior to 2005 and yields of 17% on sites added to the portfolio from 2005 to 2010. On assets added after 2010, including those from our GTP and Verizon transactions, NOI yields averaged around 6% as of the end of the first quarter. We believe there is significant upside in this vintage of sites as additional equipment is deployed, particularly given the expected acceleration of 5G rollouts over the next few years. Our U.S. tower leadership team has done a terrific job managing our base of assets in the U.S., having locked in more than $28 billion in contractually committed revenue as of the end of the first quarter. Margins in this business, including all of the M&A completed over the last several years, have continued to expand with the property segment operating profit margin coming in at nearly 79% in Q1, accompanied by cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue of just 4.1%. Additionally, our U.S. business ROIC has continued to rise over the last 10 years, while we have nearly doubled our asset base. We now have around 3,000 tenants in the U.S., including a vertical segment focusing on nontraditional tenants. This segment, although still in relatively early stages of development, generated more than 15% of our non-MLA related U.S. [new] [ph] business in the quarter. From an operational perspective, over the past year, our U.S. team has been focused on automating tasks to reduce cycle times, implementing a fleet of drones to secure more accurate data on our sites and implementing several new innovative contract structures, providing process efficiencies for both ourselves and our tenants and reducing the need for site-specific evaluations. From a macro industry perspective, over the next few years, we see several trends unfolding in the U.S. First, we believe the cloud is going to come closer to the edge. Second, 5G will be deployed using a number of different spectrum bands, depending upon the specific areas coverage and capacity requirements, which will look like as somewhat labeled, like a 3-layer cake, opening up the network to allow for a multitude of different customer experiences. And third, the variety of end-user devices and applications is expected to grow faster than we could possibly imagine. In addition, much of this activity should enable our customers to be able to wirelessly transmit data at a lower cost per bit. The overall increase in our tenants resulting value proposition, driven by continued 4G and new 5G network deployments on our infrastructure, will, we expect, continue to increase our NOI yields and returns on invested capital. While we expect to have 4G-related infrastructure on our sites for years to come, we believe ubiquitous 5G deployments are also on our doorstep. What is interesting is that, in fact, each of the major carriers have initially deployed 5G in their own unique ways. Multiple spectrum bands have been and will continue to be deployed, spanning the range from high-band millimeter wave in cities to low band, like 600 megahertz, in rural areas and will ultimately be coupled with mid-band spectrum to support their customers' needs around suburbs and highway corridors. Importantly, we continue to believe that the majority of the sub-6 gigahertz spectrum deployments throughout the country will be on macro towers, and that mid-band spectrum will be a critical component of our tenants' 5G networks. We continue to expect mid-band deployments to accelerate beginning in the second half of this year as the new T-Mobile builds out more of its 2.5-gig spectrum for the foreseeable future. As I mentioned, we also expect spending on 4G networks to continue, given that the migration of the user base from 4G to 5G will take a number of years. Bottom line, we believe that as a result, a tremendous amount of incrementally more complex equipment should end up on our towers across the U.S. over the next five to 10 years, allowing our business to continue to excel. As I mentioned, we believe that over the next several years, the cloud is going to get closer to the edge. We're already seeing this trend from the major hyperscalers, and as a result, continue to evaluate the opportunities that might be there for us. What will also be interesting is how the hyperscale and cloud service providers will interact and position themselves with the carriers. So as a result, we continue to explore trials and partnerships with a variety of different players, including hyperscalers, cloud service providers, carriers, data center companies and equipment suppliers to see just how our infrastructure may plug into this new environment. Using our existing set of assets on the edge data center front, we continue to learn about the rapidly evolving edge ecosystem through our ownership of the metro interconnect facility in Atlanta and initial deployments of several trial edge data facilities at our tower sites. At a high level, we continue to believe that as information generation and processing progressively moves to the network edge, particularly with respect to advanced IoT applications, there will be a greater need for lower latency through distributed storage and compute functionality in close proximity to both wireless and wireline end consumers. Edge compute offerings may eventually serve autonomous vehicle networks, interactive and immersive media delivery, cloud gaming and any number of other products and services where lower latency is a must and/or data needs to be closer to the consumer machine, where we believe the opportunity for us can truly scale. And while the potential for a scaled mobile edge solution is likely several years away, we are seeing initial positive indications of customer interest in our assets and are also having numerous conversations with a number of parties that are likely to play a significant role in the edge going forward. One such example is with Microsoft through their Azure Edge Zones program, where we are now a named partner. As time goes on, we are hopeful that other partnerships will develop to help us accelerate the development of the edge data model. On the indoor connectivity side, we continue to explore ways to leverage carrier-grade Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and CBRS spectrum to create converged networks. These targeted neutral host solutions can make sense in a much broader array of venues than traditional DAS. So in other words, drastically increasing the total addressable market. We've been part of the CBRS alliance for many years and have several CBRS-based deployments throughout the country. As demand for better, faster and more secure network connectivity continues to accelerate in apartment buildings, class A office space and other similar locations, we are positioning American Tower to hopefully play a meaningful role in satisfying that demand. Here, again, we are likely at least a few years away from potentially scaling CBRS-based neutral host systems but are already seeing positive indications of demand for fixed wireless access, private networks and other solutions in these types of locations. As we look at these and other U.S.-based innovation opportunities, I want to underscore that our investment criteria and philosophy remains the same: we are looking for scalable, exclusive, multi-tenant franchise real estate digital infrastructure opportunities that have the potential to deliver consistent, sustainable, recurring growth for us with returns that rival those of our existing tower model. Taking these innovation initiatives together with our high-performing existing U.S. business, we are energized about the future. The secular trends driving demand for space on our franchise real estate assets continues to accelerate, and we believe we are optimally positioned to convert that demand into attractive total returns for our stockholders over the long-term. Further, our business has performed extremely well through a variety of economic and capital market cycles, and we are confident that American Tower will again stand and deliver through the current turmoil. With that, I turn the call over to Rod to go through our results for the quarter and our updated full year outlook. Rod? Hey, thanks, Jim. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to first recognize our Board Chairman, Jim Taiclet, for his incredible leadership, judgment and friendship over these last 20 years. Over that period, our business has grown from operating in just three markets, generating about $1 billion in revenue with 15 sites to where we are today. That, in and of itself, is amazing and a testament to his leadership, but it's the way he has guided us and built this culture that, in my mind, will forever be his legacy and my compass for where we go from here. So Jim, I'd like to say on behalf of all your investors and employees, we thank you. Okay. Operator, please, now, let's open the lines for some Q&A. Thanks, Jim. And thanks, Brett, as well for the comments. I think, as Jim said, I mean, what kind of supports and underwrites the overall international strategy is it's the same business model as we have in the United States. It's not a new set of products and services. And so it allows us to take the model that we built in the United States in terms of how we look at an infrastructure, how we actually look at the master lease agreements and being able to take that offshore into those large, emerging market economies to be able to drive growth. The other piece that Jim talked about was the diversification. We underwrite these investments operationally, which I'll spend a minute some thoughts on it in a minute, but it's a very diversified portfolio. And so we are scattered around in 19 markets, 18 of which are outside of the United States. And we also think that, that serves as a useful way for us to be able to kind of underwrite the risk. The third is we're large incumbents. Our customers are the largest telecommunications companies around the world. So it's we're not dealing with consumers. We're not dealing with a number of small players. These are the large AT&Ts and Verizons outside of out of the United States. And operationally, when we look at the investments themselves, we're looking at them over a very long period of time, so we have a 10-year discounted cash flow, and we underwrite them with a risk-adjusted cost of capital. So we are caring for a lot of the risks that you would normally see. And they have escalators in them that are CPI based, utilizing local debt, reinvesting that cash back into the business. And so we think if we're able to do this in a very balanced way, a very diversified way, we're going to be able to successfully enjoy the growth that we're seeing from these markets that, as you all know, are anywhere from three to five years behind the U.S. from a technology perspective. So we think that's a sound approach, a balanced approach, again, to being able to kind of leverage all the opportunity we see offshore. Jim, if I could just add a couple of comments there in terms of our ability to build new assets in these international markets. When we build new assets, those are our highest yielding investments and we've been able to build a lot of assets around the globe, more than 4,000 sites last year. And this year, we expect to build even more than that. So it's a way for us to kind of expand our horizon and be able to deploy significant capital in the most productive way possible. Yes. Rick, I think with - first of all, thank you for your comments and your thoughts. T-Mobile and Sprint have been working and thinking about, I think, their network deployment plans for some time now. So now that the deal is, in fact, closed, we're now able to sit down with them in a meaningful way to talk about a number of different contractual structures with them. I mean, to this point, we've seen some level of increase in the pipeline, but it's still awaiting the bulk really of what we would expect to eventually come through as they ramp up their network deployments. And so we would expect that, as we said, more in the second half of the year to start up some of the more significant volumes. But these are multiyear master lease agreements that master lease agreement structurally that we would put in place. Clearly, we would entertain one of our traditional holistic agreements, where we think it makes sense for us, as well as makes sense for T-Mobile and Sprint. But I think you could be assured that there are significant conversations going on as we speak. T-Mobile is very anxious to get going in terms of being able to meet a lot of their network commitments, and they'll be very aggressive, I am sure. And we are very much committed to being there. And we'll want to tailor the MLA to really be mutually advantaged to both of us. And so that kind of those events will be going on heavily, I would suspect, over the next 60 to 90 days. Ric, just as an update. I think as Rod really mentioned, I mean, the process has largely been put on hold as have so many things as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. And so my sense is that I mean, and they're on, as you know, full lockdown in the country itself. So it's really status quo as we sit right now. We anticipate in the second half of the year there'll be further hearings to discuss the payment time line for dues and things like that. But everything is really on hold at this point in time. Thanks, Ric, and you too. Yes. No, thanks, Michael, and thanks for your congratulations as well. We did set out revenue goals internally, and we've actually talked about them externally, that within a 10-year period, and this is goals that we actually set back in 2017. We would generate probably incremental $1.5 billion from innovation-related events and activities. And fundamentally, there are really two principal elements of those innovation initiatives. First of all, it'll be utilizing exclusive real estate rights and would be multi-tenant. So very much related to our existing tower business. If you kind of step back and you think about our innovation strategy, it's really based upon, again, this neutral multi-tenant connectivity platform, as I'll refer to it, with our own stack that includes exclusive real estate, passive infrastructure, power, transport, compute layers, and again, I refer to that as kind of as our ATC stack on our existing or on a new platform that we are currently building, platform ATC, if you will. I'm not a marketing guy, Michael, but platform ATC. So everything that we're trialing from our edge computing initiatives, power initiatives, our in-building initiatives, the ones that you were referring to, and the kind of the multitude of international access and transport initiatives, they're largely fiber based, are really meant to be constructive as we really build out this stack, if you will, on this platform. So it's not a vertical point solution, but really a broad kind of a horizontal platform, if you will, capable of providing really a myriad of connectivity services. So if you think about 2020, we have three or four kind of major initiatives going on, again, building out this stack, if you will, this platform, if you will. And the first one is what you referred to, is kind of building out our in-building capabilities. We're trying to drive down the traditional DAS costs that we've developed and segment that we've developed over the last 20 years. And we're really trying to open it up to increase the overall TAM. So we're using CBRS spectrum and really opportunities to increase the tendency as well as increase the offload from our customers. We're also trying to more fully develop what we call our transport layer of the stack. And we're looking at fiber to the curb shared initiatives to really facilitate multiservice providers, and we're doing that largely down in Latin America. You also referred to, and we're doing additional work on developing and exploring our edge-based distributed compute and mobile edge computing opportunities. And I mentioned some of those in my remarks, but we're really trying to leverage our Colo Atl [ph] asset in certain sites in our U.S. portfolio. And finally, kind of rounding it out, we're really trying to improve our overall power layer of the stack. We continue to develop a hybrid shared power solution really using historical diesel-fueled generator power with new lower-cost solar and battery packs. So it's a bit of a double click on many of the initiatives. But clearly, we're at the early stages of the development of this stack, if you will. But we do think, again, it's a very effective way to look at our ability to leverage our existing core set of assets and to be able to offer new types of services to existing customers as well as to new types of customers around the globe. So we'll talk more broadly about that. I think on an upcoming call, our second or third quarter call where we take a deeper dive into a lot of the innovation initiatives. But we're well on our way, and we're very focused and we're doing it, I think, very efficiently. We're not throwing money against the wall here, if you will, in terms of building it out. We're being very focused but we're and we're, as you know, I think we have a CTO that we brought in a couple of years ago that is really providing an overall oversight on these overall initiatives that we have. So as I said, more to come, and we'll feel this back even further in a couple of quarters. Michael, sure. I mean, that could always be. We haven't seen that necessarily. We're obviously given kind of the essential ticket, so we're able to be out at the sites, but it could be effective on or could affect our build-to-suit program. For example, we've actually come back a bit on the build-to-suit program. We think that those sites will ultimately be deployed, but the timing could be affected by construction personnel from being out of the site. And we are considered essential personnel. So we think that we won't see significant delays there. But as this continues to go along and if it intensifies, sure, that could delay some of the growth that we see in business. But more specifically, I think it's around build-to-suit. Yes. And this brings a good point. I mean, one of our initial thoughts was would there be some issues from a supply chain perspective, and it's not necessarily bringing in big radios and things like antennas in, but it's usually that $0.50 part that might get in the way of actually deploying infrastructure. And we haven't seen that at this point in time, but and we don't anticipate it. But as I said, if this continues on, we think we're in a good spot, but and our customers are in a good spot, but time will tell. Yes. No, Spencer. We always are looking at opportunities, M&A opportunities. As you know, we have business development teams around the globe. And it's a fairly lengthy number of opportunities that are out there, if you will. Whether they're COVID-19 related or not, there continue to be a lot of assets out there up for sale. Back in the 2008, 2009 time frame, there was a significant amount of growth. There were companies that were just distressed and looking to monetize their assets. And we actually were pretty aggressive back at the time and picked up some sizable assets. And so we'll see. I think we're in still early stages, if you will, in terms of the pandemic, in terms of its impacting a particular company's financial position. As Rod mentioned before, we have a sizable liquidity position at this point in time. So I think we're really well positioned to be opportunistic here. But we'll go back to our fundamental investment policy and the way we look at deals, and we'll continue to manage it and monitor it that way. And so time will tell. We just closed two transactions at the end of last year, which we're currently integrating and it's going very well. And so we'll continue to see how the year pans out. But as I said, I think we're in a good financial position to be able to strike at some of these to the extent they become available and make sense to us. Yes. No. Thanks, David, and thanks for your congrats as well. We've got an excellent strategic and tactical blueprint that I believe that's in place that Jim and I, and the rest of my colleagues that we developed and that we're currently executing. We refer to it as is our Stand and Deliver strategy. And as you know, there are four key elements of it. There's industry leadership. There's a focused innovation process, one that I just talked about a few minutes ago. It's enhancing our efficiency initiatives. And it's a continuing drive for growth, profitable growth, sustainable growth, both organically and inorganically. I think that the way we have consistently thought about creating shareholder value based upon sound principles, around capital allocation and investment criteria, our dividend policy, the way we manage our balance sheet, is absolutely sound. So I mean, I don't see any changes to the way that we've been operating the business, and clearly, no changes to the blueprint that we really have in place. I think that the existing team is outstanding. And so now it's up to us to continue to execute. Will we adjust it and tweak it as the market evolves? Absolutely, as we have continually doing. And as we have done over the last 10, 15 years, if we need to, just, as I say, just as we always have. But the fundamentals are solid. I mean, I don't have any grandiose notions that, okay, we're going to be a $20 billion business by 2025. If that happens, terrific. But we're just going to continue to keep our heads down, really move on the strategy that we've got in place. I think that there are as I was talking a few minutes ago, I think there are a lot of really interesting elements of our innovation strategy, which I think are going to increase the overall addressable market that we're going to be able to take our fair share of. And we're going to continue to globalize. We're a very good and very big international business. I think that there are opportunities for us to continue to globalize, particularly when you look at some centralized global business, operational centers that we have. And so I think there are a lot of things that we can do on the efficiency side. And on the leadership side, Jim is really he's got big shoes to fill on the leadership side, and I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to really push the envelope in terms of how we're positioned in all the markets that we're in. But when you kind of step back and you look at our inventory, we own about 1/3 of the inventory the assets, if you will, of the 20 market, 19 markets that we're in. So there's a lot of opportunity for inorganic growth. And I think we've got a great business model to enjoy organic growth going forward. So I think we've got the fundamental pieces in place. As I said, we'll tweak it and adjust it based upon where the market is and how the market evolves. But feel very good about the blueprint that we've got in place. Yes. No. Thanks, Simon, and thanks for your congrats as well. I think when you kind of step back and you take a look at our overall edge computing initiatives, I'd really look at it in kind of two pieces. First of all, from a pure distribution or distributed compute perspective, those are aware we've actually had some early-on successes, and this is where we're actually putting cages out at our particular sites. And we're offering edge computing to enterprise, smaller enterprise, midsized enterprise accounts, where they're looking to perhaps move to the public cloud and just looking for some of their workloads to being more distributed. So that's the kind of the easy element and the easy piece that I think we've experienced. And then the second, more complicated piece, candidly, is on the kind of traditional mobile edge computing. And I see this from a number of different elements. I see this from the data center side, we're obviously looking at it from the hyperscaler side. And this is where we're looking at the opportunity for lower latency types of needs that we think are going to be ultimately developing out at the edge and how we might be able to participate in that. And so we have, as you know, the Colo Atl facility that we picked up a couple of or last year, really. And we're looking to interconnect that offering and kind of access to the cloud and trying to interconnect it back to our own sites themselves with the compute power that we're putting out at the sites to see what that ecosystem, if you will, looks like. I don't actually know how this is all ultimately going to pan out. I don't know the relationships that we're going to see with the hyperscalers as well as with the carriers. We see a lot of initiatives going on between Amazon and Google and Azure in terms of how they're looking at the C-RAN and how they're working with AT&T and Verizon and getting further and further out to the edge. We think that we have some very valuable assets that can be part of that overall solution. And we're looking to be able to kind of leverage the assets that we have to be able to support that. But this is going to be something that, as I mentioned before, it's going to take a while to figure out how to scale. I don't think that without the kind of the whole vehicle element here, with all the IoT element here that it's really going to be something that we can scale efficiently. But that's probably three to five years away. And so we're participating in a number of different trials. As I said, we're taking advantage of this kind of distributed compute capability, and we're trying to figure out how we might fit into the overall mobile edge computing environment going forward. So more to come on that. But as I said, I think we've got some very valuable assets there that can play a meaningful role in some way. Yes. Colby, on that particular question, I think because of the lack of the wireline presence, I think the governments themselves are going to continue to put pressure on the carriers themselves to ensure that their connectivity continues. And as Jim said, we've been on to some tables with WEF and talking with some of our customers there. I mean, they're all essential and they're incredibly important in terms of ensuring that their customers are connected, particularly with this disease that is so isolationary. So yes, I think that, that demand is going to continue there. As Rod kind of walked through some of our growth rates, we're looking at kind of that 7% to 8% growth rate in Latin America and up in the high single-digit growth rate in Africa. So we're - I believe that, that kind of the growth is actually going to continue. There will there be issues associated with collections and delays and things like that, internet? We haven't seen it, candidly. But to the extent that this continues, sure, that can always be something that we'll that we might see. But we're monitoring it closely. We have obviously, very close relationships with our customers. Our infrastructure is critical to their ability to be able to continue to meet the needs of their customers. So I think we'll be able to manage through that. But we're monitoring it, and we'll watch it very closely and work with our customers to be able to, for all of us, to be able to get through this pandemic. On your first question, could there be delays in organic growth, and we've mentioned some of the delays in the build-to-suit program, the collections issues that we're seeing in India, we've been managing and monitoring those for many years. And so we're working again with our customers. We have an incredible management team in place there who have really terrific relationships with our customers. And so we'll work with them. But ultimately, I think we're in a good position, again, kind of given the critical nature of our infrastructure and that being infrastructure that's really going to allow us all if you kind of get through this pandemic itself. Yes. Sure, Brad. Let me take the kind of the 5G question, and then I'll ask Rod to kind of manage through the other myriad questions that you asked here. On the 5G side, I think all the carriers themselves, as I mentioned, have taken kind of their own unique approach to being able to deploy it. I mean, if you take a look at Verizon on the millimeter wave, they're in 34 cities, 17 NFL stadiums. On the sub-6, they're talking about using dynamic spectrum sharing, no stated time lines. AT&T in the millimeter, they deployed 5G in, I think, roughly 35 cities. They're adding new 5G cities this year. They have a sizable amount of millimeter-wave spectrum as well. And then in the sub-6, they're providing 5G in, I think, upwards of 100 markets using kind of low-band 5G. And T-Mobile have also taken a very different approach, largely leveraging their sub-6 spectrum now with Sprint with their 2.5 gig kind of sitting on top of a lot of their 600 megahertz spectrum, but they also have a sizable amount of millimeter-wave spectrum. So I think all of the carriers have taken very different approaches. All ultimately will be circling around kind of this 3-level layer cake, as I've talked about before, where it's at the very base level, kind of the sub-2 gigahertz level, good propagation, limited capacity, but really, it'd be able to get kind of nationwide coverage. The mid-band, which we've talked about, the CBRS and C band, which we think will ultimately be auctioned off this year, improved capacity, lower propagation. And then the millimeter wave, and they'll look at millimeter wave as being that spectrum that you use for dense urban and urban markets. So I think the carriers themselves, as they've always had, are going to leverage the spectrum that they have. They're going to try to put their hands on more spectrum, as they always have, to be able to come up with this kind of this 3-level approach to being able to deploy 5G. And as I said, it's I think it's on our doorstep. And we'll be seeing it over the next several years get built out. I think some of the forecasts are saying that by 2025 or 2026, 70-some-odd percent of the traffic will be 5G based. So I just think they're going to continue to look at various forms of spectrum, and it's the propagation characteristics are very different, as you well know, but they'll take advantage given the kind of geography that they're looking to support. And Rod on the other? Great. Thank you, everybody, for being with us this morning. I know we went a little bit late, but I really do appreciate you hanging in there with us. And again, as we've all said, be safe, really, in this environment and keep your family safe, social distance and be well and look forward to catching up with you. Thanks, again."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Tower Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our Stand and Deliver strategy. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2021 results and 2022 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we generated strong results in 2021, while strategically deploying capital to assets that we believe will further enhance our future growth trajectory and augment our ability to continue to deliver compelling total shareholder returns for many years to come. The strength of our operational and financial results reflects the high-quality nature of our tower business model, the dedication of our talented global teams and our commitment to provide best-in-class service to our customers. It also reflects our commitment to sustainability and being a good corporate citizen which provides additional purpose and continues to be a focus at every level of the organization. Last year at this time, we presented multiyear targets for U.S. organic tenant billings growth and AFFO per share growth. And I'm pleased to be able to say that we're exactly where we thought we would be today as it relates to those targets. We continue to expect to average at least 4% in U.S. organic tenant billings growth from 2021 through 2027 on a reported basis, implying an average of at least 5%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. And as part of these projections, we anticipate an acceleration in U.S. organic tenant billings growth between 2023 and 2027, when we are targeting growth rates of at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6%, excluding the Sprint churn. Similarly, on the AFFO side of the equation, we believe we are on track to average at least 10% growth in AFFO per share, on average through 2027. This includes a year of more subdued growth in 2022, as expected but also a recovery in growth rates in 2023 and beyond as the Sprint churn impacts fade and global secular growth tailwinds continue. 5G is probably the most significant of these growth drivers. And in 2021, we saw the early stages of transformational 5G network upgrades in multiple markets, including nearly $105 billion spent by U.S. carriers for critical mid-band spectrum and over $65 billion in CapEx deployed by carriers into network investments across our global footprint. With mobile data consumption expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 25% over the next five years in the United States and at even higher rates in some of our international markets, we anticipate prolonged network investment cycles to drive compelling, sustained growth rates across our regions. And while we believe our macro tower assets will continue to drive the vast majority of growth and returns for the company as 5G advances, we're also excited about additional opportunities that we expect to arise from the accelerating cloud-based interconnected and globally distributed digital transformation that is in it's early stages today. We expect our recently closed CoreSite acquisition to augment our ability to capture potential upside from this transformation while enhancing the value of our existing portfolio of distributed communications real estate over time. We anticipate these expectations to be underpinned by the continued execution of the four strategic pillars in our Stand and Deliver strategy, growing our assets and capabilities, driving industry leadership, operational efficiency and extending our platform. As part of our commitment to growing our assets and capabilities to meet our customers' needs, we deployed more than $10 billion for tower M&A in 2021 focused on Europe, where we have meaningfully improved our long-term strategic positioning. We saw accelerated organic growth trends in the region throughout the last year and we expect those trends to continue, supported by data growth projected at a CAGR of 26% over the next five years across our major European markets. Separately, we added strategic financial partners, CDPQ and Allianz, who joined our existing partner, PGGM, creating a solid platform for future growth and investment ahead of what we anticipate being an exciting decade in the European marketplace. In addition to expanding through M&A, we further grew our asset base through our internal CapEx program by investing $1.4 billion, primarily to construct a record of nearly 6,400 new communication sites, along with deploying nearly $120 million towards our energy efficiency investments, primarily in Africa. These investments continue to generate returns that are among the highest in our portfolio. Through our talented teams and operational expertise, we expect to remain a preferred partner to support customers as they execute on their network build-outs which we expect to drive continued acceleration in our new site construction for the next several years, while advancing our sustainability efforts and commitment to a greener mobile future. Through our commitment to enhance our industry leadership, we've continued our focus on sustainability by accelerating our efforts to combat climate change, as evidenced by our recent adoption of science-based targets for carbon emission reductions. These targets represent direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 40% by 2035 against the 2019 baseline, as well as targets to reduce indirect supply chain emissions by at least 40%. To date, we've invested over $275 million in CapEx towards energy efficiency and reduction solutions which directly support our committed targets and initiatives. Concurrent with our emissions reduction targets and renewable energy investments, we are actively working on various land stewardship and social impact initiatives. We're a member of the World Economic Forum's EDISON Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge which aims to spur development of affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance and education to the underserved. Through our involvement, we engaged with an array of high-level country and regional platforms and committed our time, expertise and ideas to make digital access a top priority for all. Also this past year, American Tower was awarded a 2021 World Summit on the Information Society prize for our digital communities program which spans across India, Africa and Latin America and seeks to improve the quality of life and increase economic opportunity through connectivity. At the end of 2021, we reached a significant milestone of launching our 200th digital community in India and have set a goal to grow to 2,000 digital communities globally over the next five years, focusing on education, health care access, financial inclusion and career development. Finally, we advanced our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by implementing customized plans focused on talent development, recruitment and education to enhance our inclusive culture across our global footprint. We also continued our partnership with HBCU supporting critical infrastructure enhancement projects and engaging in academic and professional development opportunities for their talented students. Further, we extended our leadership position and NAREIT's Dividends Through Diversity, Equity and Inclusion CEO Council which addresses opportunities related to DE&I in the REIT and publicly traded real estate industry. Also, we stay on top of the best ESG practices, policies and actions within the REIT sector through active participation on NAREIT councils and initiatives. These accomplishments and areas of focus are reflections of our unwavering commitment to operating our global business in a sustainable way while guided by our core principles. We are also steadfast in driving operational efficiency throughout the business. Over the past several years, we've implemented shared service center model, executed on various cost control and process improvement initiatives and implemented site level enhancements that not only drive value to American Tower but also for our customers. An example of these initiatives is our use of drone technology to help us ensure the structural integrity of our sites. In 2021, our U.S. team demonstrated it's capabilities to scale up driving service revenue to it's highest level in over a decade supporting major carrier activity in preparation for 5G deployments. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we have made in the operating structures and processes that have been put in place are competitive advantages that will facilitate scalable expansion while converting meaningful top line growth to AFFO. At the same time, through our platform expansion initiatives, we've evaluated a range of new communications' real estate model to identify long-term growth opportunities that could complement and leverage our global tower presence, further advance our position as a market leader ahead of emerging technological trends and create attractive returns for our stakeholders. Through this process, we believe advanced wireless network technologies, in conjunction with the shift of computing power from the core to the edge, will accelerate digital transformation across many industries. We've only begun to understand the true capabilities and performance of widespread 5G coverage. And with new applications on the horizon, we think mobile edge computing will become a critical component of converged neutral host infrastructure. We believe today's 5G Edge, deployed in public or private networks with regional site hosting, will evolve to distributed tower-centric locations. We think future AI and machine learning, edge-optimized solutions supporting massive IoT devices and immersive experiences enabled with AR and VR, such as gaming, health care and education, will drive latency-sensitive edge deployments across our strategically positioned set of assets. We expect this evolution and these deployments to drive a meaningful TAM with our distributed macro tower assets ideally located to host such computing infrastructure and an integrated grid that enhances our competitive position and service offerings. Together with the CoreSite and our other data center assets, we have the scale to enable a richly interconnected hub-and-spoke edge-computing model that extends today's data center multi-cloud ecosystem out to our distributed neutral host sites, greatly enhancing our probability of success at the edge. On that note, I'd like to welcome the CoreSite team to the American Tower family. And together, I look forward to executing on our long-term development plan, while driving meaningful incremental value to our macro tower sites over time. As we move forward, we remain focused on further enhancing our investment-grade balance sheet which has been a critical element that has enabled us to grow and we expect it to remain an important component of our future success as well. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. And with the strength of our balance sheet as our foundation, we will continue to apply our Stand and Deliver strategic framework to capture value as 5G and growing mobile demand present compelling growth opportunities for American Tower. In closing, we believe that our comprehensive global portfolio, strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation strategy and continued focus on sustainability position us to extend our track record of driving solid growth and returns as we embark upon an exciting new era of digital transformation enabled by 5G. We will continue to execute on our Stand and Deliver strategy and follow the same values and discipline that have fueled our track record over the last two decades. As we continue to build and strengthen our diverse comprehensive portfolio, while enhancing our operational capabilities, we believe American Tower is well positioned to support our global customer base as we enter a hyper-connected, digitally driven world. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our 2021 results and the details of our 2022 outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are well. As you just heard from Tom, American Tower had another year of solid performance which included strong Q4 results throughout our global business. Before we dive into the details of our expectations for 2022, I'll briefly review our Q4 and full year 2021 results. To start, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year. First, 2021 marked another year of strong overachievement against our initial AFFO per share targets. For the full year, we posted consolidated and attributable AFFO per share growth of 13.7% and 11.7%, respectively. This is a demonstration of our ability to deliver solid total revenue growth, tightly manage operating costs and execute on strategically important M&A transactions, all while maintaining a thoughtful and disciplined approach to our capital structure. I'll also note, this is a great start towards achieving our previously stated objective of delivering, on average, double-digit AFFO per share growth between 2021 and 2027. Second, we delivered our third consecutive year of record new builds. As we've discussed previously, these newly constructed sites continue to be amongst our best uses of capital. And in 2021, we saw average day 1 NOI yield of nearly 12% over the nearly 6,400 sites we constructed. Finally, during 2021, we completed two strategic M&A transactions and, as a result, strengthened our position in the United States and Europe, two critically important markets for us. With that, let's dive into the details of our Q4 and full year 2021 results. Turning to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated property revenues grew by more than 13% year-over-year or over 14% on an FX-neutral basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, property revenue grew 1.2%. This included an organic tenant billings growth decline of 0.5% or an increase of over 4% when excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. As a reminder, over half of the total Sprint churn commenced in 2021, primarily on October 1, as expected. International property revenues grew over 28%, with nearly 20% driven by contributions from our Telxius assets. International organic tenant billings growth was 5.7%, led by Latin America at 7.4%, followed by Africa at 7.3% and Europe at 6.6%. APAC grew for the second consecutive quarter, coming in at 1.3%. This was complemented by the addition of nearly 1,900 high-yielding, newly constructed sites across our international markets. Moving to adjusted EBITDA; growth was over 10% in the quarter, while the impacts of Sprint churn, combined with the addition of newer, lower-tenancy assets, drove a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 62%. Finally, consolidated AFFO per share grew 3.8% in the quarter or 4.3%, excluding the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. This included nearly $140 million of year-on-year cash-adjusted EBITDA growth which was partially offset by the higher net cash interest expense, along with higher cash taxes and maintenance costs. As anticipated, the timing of these expenses was heavily back-end weighted in 2021, resulting in a material impact to the year-over-year growth rates in Q4. Meanwhile, AFFO per share attributable to American Tower common stockholders grew by 1.4% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was 14.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 3.8% and total tenant billings growth of 11.3%. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was nearly 9%, with organic tenant billings growth of 2.9%. This included contributions from co-locations and amendments of 3.2%; another 3% in growth from escalators; around 0.2% in negative impacts from other run rate items; and churn of 3% which consisted of around 1.8% in normal cost churn and the balance driven by Sprint. This was complemented by new asset contributions to tenant billings of 4.1% and approximately $144 million in higher straight-line revenues as compared to 2020. Our international property revenue grew by over 21% with organic tenant billings growth of 5.5% for the year. Overall colocation and amendment growth was 5.9%, while 3.8% came from escalators and 0.3% from other run rate items, all of which was partially offset by 4.5% of churn. This elevated churn was primarily concentrated in India, where more recently, we have started to see the churn rate moderate. Finally, with our recent expanded data center portfolio, we have introduced a new data center segment within total property, consisting of the newly acquired CoreSite and DataSite assets along with our existing Colo ATL facility. This segment contributed approximately $23 million to our total property revenue in 2021. Turning to Slide 10; adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the year to nearly $6 billion. This included strong flow-through of organic tenant billings growth; $100 million in incremental services gross margin versus 2020; over $140 million in net straight-line growth, as well as around $300 million in contributions to growth from newly acquired assets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 20 basis points as compared to 2020, primarily due to the impacts of Sprint churn in the U.S. and the addition of newer lower tenancy international assets which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time. We also grew consolidated AFFO by 15.4% and consolidated AFFO per share by 13.7% in 2021, with over $680 million in cash adjusted EBITDA growth from the drivers I just mentioned. This growth was partially offset by higher financing costs associated with our recent strategic M&A as well as a modest increase in maintenance CapEx and higher cash tax expense as compared to 2020. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share grew 11.7% year-over-year. With that, let's turn to our outlook for 2022. I'll start by highlighting a few key assumptions underlying our projections. First, we expect a strong year of new leasing activity across our operations, with anticipated gross new business contributions to total tenant billings growth nearly 7% higher than what we saw in 2021. This expectation is being driven by a few key items. In the U.S., the comprehensive MLAs we've signed over the last few years are continuing to result in solid levels of new business activity. In Europe, we expect an exceptionally strong year, boosted by our larger presence following the Telxius transaction. And across our developing market footprint, the demand for site continues to rise as next-generation network deployments advance. Second, we expect churn to be higher than historical levels in 2022. In the United States, this will be driven by Sprint churn we've discussed previously, with about $160 million in year-over-year impacts in 2022 versus 2021. Additionally, in select international markets, a handful of carrier consolidation events are temporarily driving churn higher. Third, we've layered in some preliminary assumptions related to our CoreSite financing. And finally, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $125 million for property revenue, $70 million for adjusted EBITDA and $55 million for consolidated AFFO versus 2021. Moving into the details on Slide 11, you can see we expect total property revenues of over $10.3 billion at the midpoint, representing growth of 13% or nearly 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes expected property revenue growth of less than 1% in the U.S. and Canada and over 14% of FX-neutral growth in our international regions. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $705 million of growth in cash revenue to the Property segment in 2022. Turning to Slide 12 and unpacking the property revenue growth assumptions a bit, you'll see our expected organic tenant billings growth rates for 2022. I'd like to note here that our tenant billings metrics do not include contributions from the data centers segment. Looking at the United States and Canada, we anticipate growth of approximately 1%, in line with the 2022 expectations implied in the long-term projections we presented last year. This includes contributions to growth from colocations and amendments of roughly $150 million, representing solid double-digit growth versus 2021. We expect this to be partially offset by churn of over 5% which includes a 3.7% impact associated with Sprint. Turning to Latin America; we expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 6% for the year, supported by solid gross colocation and amendment activity as well as additional growth from our CPI-based escalators which we anticipate to be around 300 basis points higher than in 2021. These items are being partially offset by higher churn in 2022, primarily related to Telefonica in Mexico as well as the continuation of Nextel churn in Brazil. With both events, we expect to receive settlement payments over the course of 2022, compensating us for the early termination of leases ahead of their expiration, where applicable. As is typical, these payments will fall outside of the organic tenant billings growth metrics. Moving to Africa; organic tenant billings growth is expected to be in the 6% range. We continue to see strong demand for our macro tower assets driving colocation and amendment growth of around 6.5% for the year. In addition, we expect escalators to be up as compared to 2021 by roughly 90 basis points. This will be partially offset by an expectation for elevated churn as carrier consolidation and some smaller market exit events from Q4 of 2021 work their way through our 2022 financial metrics. Meanwhile, in Europe, we're seeing the benefits of added scale from the Telxius acquisition, the early stages of 5G rollouts and low churn, all driving expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9% in 2022. This includes roughly 6% in contributions from colocations and amendments and escalators of around 4.5%. These higher escalators are being driven by the combination of higher CPI and the mechanics of having the Telxius assets in our numbers for the full year of 2022. Churn is expected to decline to around 1.5% as we benefit from the lower-churn Telxius assets and reduced cancellations across our legacy business as carrier consolidation events wind down. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we're guiding to 2% to 3% organic tenant billings growth in 2022, including churn of around 5%, representing less than half of the 2021 churn rate. At the same time, our outlook does imply a reduction to gross colocation and amendment growth contributions relative to 2021 levels as carriers in the marketplace continue to digest recent developments. With that said, we are encouraged by the market reforms aimed at improving the overall health of the telecom sector as well as more recent steps taken by the carriers to rationalize pricing and improve overall profitability in the marketplace. We think these steps could bode well for the long-term growth picture in India. Turning to Slide 13; at the midpoint of our outlook, we're projecting adjusted EBITDA of over $6.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10% or nearly 11% on a constant currency basis. We continue to drive solid organic growth conversion rates and are complementing this through growth on assets acquired in 2021, including approximately $360 million in expected adjusted EBITDA from CoreSite in 2022. We are seeing some margin compression in 2022. This is primarily the result of Sprint churn in the U.S., along with the full year impact of the slightly lower-margin CoreSite and Telxius assets. That said, the benefits of our continued focus on operational efficiency are taking hold in our regional legacy businesses, particularly in Africa, where our commitment to sustainable energy solutions and strong cost controls are driving meaningful expansions in margins. Turning to Slide 14; we expect consolidated AFFO to grow by more than $380 million to over $4.7 billion, despite absorbing approximately $160 million in negative impacts to AFFO from Sprint churn. This includes $675 million in FX-neutral cash-adjusted EBITDA growth and the expectation for maintenance CapEx to be more or less flat as compared to 2021 as capital intensity remains in the 2% range. We expect this to be partially offset by approximately $55 million in higher cash taxes and $185 million in incremental cash interest expense, primarily associated with our preliminary CoreSite financing assumption as well as roughly $55 million in expected negative translational FX impacts. Additionally, we've layered in a common stock issuance assumption for the purposes of outlook in the first half of 2022, again, tied to the CoreSite transaction. Taking these assumptions into account, we expect our consolidated AFFO per share for the year to be $10.05, reflecting growth of 4%, or roughly 8%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders is expected to grow approximately 3% year-over-year to $9.70 per share in 2022. This includes an assumption of approximately $165 million in minority interest impacts related to our partnerships in Europe. Moving on to Slide 15, let's review our capital deployment in 2021 and expectations for 2022. In 2021, we declared nearly $2.4 billion of common dividend distributions, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. We spent another $1.4 billion through our CapEx programs, over $500 million of which was dedicated to our development projects, including the construction of nearly 6,400 new sites across the globe. Finally, we deployed over $20 billion, including the assumption of debt to acquire the Telxius and CoreSite assets as well as a handful of smaller transactions around the world. We expect these new assets to drive meaningful accretion and shareholder value over time. Looking to 2022, our dividend remains a top priority. And subject to board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $2.8 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to increase the dividend in line with our stated long-term, double-digit growth targets. We also expect to deploy roughly $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, over 90% of which will be discretionary. Of our total discretionary capital spending, we expect approximately $270 million to be directed towards attractive organic development opportunities in our data center segment. On the tower side, we expect to deploy roughly $565 million in development CapEx, primarily for the construction of 6,500 sites in our International segment. Similar to 2021, we anticipate driving average day 1 NOI yields on these new builds of nearly 12%. As you can see on the chart to the right, these international new site investments have driven exceptional returns over time. In our earliest vintage, we're seeing average NOI yields of 46%. Sites built between 2010 and 2014 are yielding around 26%. And on the more than 26,000 sites we've constructed since the start of 2015, we're seeing yields in the 20% range, with room to expand as we continue to drive lease-up on these lower-tenured sites. Looking forward, we believe our international new-build program presents a significant opportunity to continue adding meaningful portfolio scale while achieving highly attractive returns. And we'll continue to prioritize site development opportunities as a key part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term. Turning now to Slide 16, we've laid out our current thoughts around the permanent financing strategy for our CoreSite acquisition. As always, the primary objective is for us to finance this transaction in a way that optimizes our capital structure within our investment-grade framework, minimizes dilution to our common stockholders and positions us to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in ways that maximize value creation for our shareholders over the long term. At a high level, we expect to get there through a combination of debt and equity issuances. The debt markets remain attractive. And as we have done in the past, we expect to be opportunistic as we seek to term out revolver and term loan borrowings into longer-term fixed rate instruments. On the equity side, we anticipate evaluating a number of alternatives, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferreds and private capital partnerships, much like we did for the Telxius acquisition in 2021. With that said, for the purposes of our initial 2022 outlook, we have assumed that roughly half of the $10 billion purchase price will be financed through a common equity issuance assumed to occur in the first half of 2022. As you can see on the slide, we anticipate that this will bring our leverage back down to the high 5x range while putting us on track to get back to 5x or below over the slightly longer term. Importantly, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and have been working closely with the rating agencies throughout this process. As we continue to evaluate a number of potential options, particularly on the equity side, we will plan to keep you all updated as to our progress. In the meantime, we believe that the baseline case we have incorporated in our current outlook positions us well as we create long-term shareholder value with the CoreSite assets. Turning now to Slide 17 and in summary, we drove strong results in 2021, including compelling double-digit AFFO per share growth, record new build activity prudent, balance sheet management and the completion of several transactions that we believe will enhance American Tower's leading global position. As we look across our global footprint, we're encouraged by what we see as a long tailwind of secular technology trends that are expected to drive continued strong recurring demand for our critical communication infrastructure assets. In the U.S. and Europe, we're well positioned to support a continued acceleration in 5G activity as carriers deploy new spectrum assets and build out greenfield networks. Meanwhile, in our early-stage markets, we expect to benefit as operators look to upgrade and densify their mobile networks to meet ever-increasing mobile data demand, all of which we believe will translate into meaningful growth and attractive total shareholder returns at American Tower for many years to come. And with that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much and good morning. Tom, I think you talked about some of the deals you've been doing over 2021. And I wanted to get a sense of your -- how do you think about M&A from here. There's a lot of portfolios available in Europe. Obviously, the public equity valuations have pulled back. So I'm not sure if there's been an adjustment on the private side as well. But how are you thinking about the opportunities out there to continue to build your business? And about what the optimal mix between regions and assets are over the medium term? And then just a housekeeping question for you, Rod. You talked about some of the churn in Latin America. You didn't call out Oi. Any update on what the recent Oi transaction and the regulatory approvals means for this year and beyond?\nTom Bartlett: Sure. Simon, I'll do the first and then, Rob, you can talk about Latin America. Simon, with regards to M&A, I mean, it's no different than we've been looking at things for the last two decades. We are -- because of our sheer size and our presence, we get invited into looking at just about every transaction that we see going on around the planet. And we evaluate them. We have business development teams in every one of our markets. Clearly, the focus for us right now is looking at opportunities in Europe. But it's -- as a result of the Telxius transaction and what we've done there before, we do have terrific scale in some of the critical markets in that region. And as you saw Rod just talk about, we're seeing really -- as we expected, given where the markets are from a 5G perspective, it's really outsized growth in 2022 going forward as the spectrum is deployed and as 5G gets rolled out. And as you said, there are a lot of portfolios there. And we are looking at all of them. A lot of it, we've seen it in the public realm and we've had ongoing discussions. But clearly, we're looking at it very, very carefully, looking at what would be the real opportunity there going forward, a very disciplined look in terms of valuation. So, it's really impossible at this point in time to speculate in terms of success in those. But we will clearly evaluate them and look at them and determine whether we can create long-term value as a result of those transactions. We have a very diverse portfolio which has really proven to be, I think, very valuable over the last 10 years as we've looked at the growth across the regions that we have. And Europe had been that particular market where we did not have the significant presence. And now we do and we're taking advantage of that growth. So we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities. And as I said, it's really difficult to predict what the outcomes might be but we'll continue to take a very disciplined review of those options.\nRod Smith: Simon, thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well. So in Latin America, just to recap here, we're guiding towards just above 6% organic tenant billings growth. And that's really driven by solid organic new bids. So we've got about 3.3% or so contributing from an organic new builds perspective. And we're also seeing outsized escalators. So we've got escalators in above 8% in that market. So nice strong escalators there. And that really is sort of an inflation hedge that we have in the Latin American markets. But we are seeing temporary elevated churn. So we've got about 5% churn coming out of Latin America. The churn that's in the outlook for 2022 is primarily Telefonica up in Mexico and then Nextel down in Brazil. Oi doesn't really play into the equation quite yet. We do have a long-term contract with Oi. So that will play out over the next seven years or so. And we'll see where that goes. I don't want to get ahead of anything that may happen in the market there from a regulatory perspective. But it's not really a main component in our 2022 numbers and we've got protection there out over seven years. And the Oi revenue is in and around 1% of our total revenue.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you, Rod.\nOperator: And our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I'm curious if you could unpack a little bit more of the domestic levels. And with AT&T talking about starting to deploy in the second half for mid-band, DISH deploying their network and Verizon continuing to build out the C-band, T-Mobile expanding and integrating, can you give us a sense of sort of what activity levels or activity assumptions are in the number? And if there's some opportunity, depending on how these expertise work their way through the system to influence performance this year and heading into next year?\nRod Smith: Nice to have you on the call. Thanks for joining us and thanks for the question. So the U.S. market in terms of organic growth or organic new builds is really quite strong. We continue to see all of the major carriers being very active. And the place that, that shows up initially, maybe as an early indicator here, is within our services business. So once again, we're guiding towards services revenue above $220 million, so still well above kind of historical levels, a little bit below where we were in 2021 but still a nice solid level of services activity. And the margins there are still coming in at 55% right where they normally do. And then when you think about the U.S. organic growth here, we're guiding towards 1% or so. And I'll give you the piece parts there. So organic new business is slightly up from where it was from the prior year in terms of a percentage basis; so that's about 3.3%. Escalators are holding very firm, slightly ahead of where they were in 2021. They're coming in at 3.1%. And then we have cancellations coming in at about five -- a little over 5% and that is primarily driven -- at least the outsized churn there is primarily driven through the Sprint churn that we've all talked about. In terms of going forward, you do know that we've got MLAs with most of our carriers, where we've got kind of lock-in revenue as well as revenue growth. So 3/4 of the ramp is in there. Even in our long-term guide, we do have about 2/3 or so of not only the underlying revenue in the guide but the actual growth locked up in MLA. So nice really clear visibility in terms of the growth that we see going out. We do have one customer that's on an \u00e0 la carte basis. So as they begin to deploy, we do expect that to ramp towards the back half of the year. And we also have the agreement with DISH which we've talked about in the past, that is beginning to produce revenue for us this year. That will escalate through the year, so we'll see a ramp-up during the year from that. And then it will continue to ramp over time. And that's what really gives us the confidence to put out the long-term growth rates that Tom talked about and getting back up into that mid-single-digit growth rate sustainably in the U.S. And then the final point that I would make is the colocation and amendment contributions to organic new business. For the year, we're guiding around $150 -- $150 million. And that's up from the level in 2021 which is close to about $130 million or so. And that represents a solid 15% year-on-year growth rate. So we're quite pleased with what we see in the U.S. from a gross growth. And the churn that we're seeing is temporary will subside and then we think growth will return into that mid-single digits in the U.S. over the long term.\nMichael Rollins: And just a follow up briefly. So for the national carriers that you have MLAs with, is mid-band 5G covered under those MLAs? Or might that be something that has to get figured out in the future?\nRod Smith: No, I think when you think about the MLAs that we have, it's based on use rights and a use-right fee that's all incorporated. So to the extent that their activity level fits within the use right bucket, then it's covered. To the extent that their activity level goes beyond what was contemplated and what was granted to them in the use right, then that would be upside. And certainly, anyone that's on an \u00e0 la carte basis, it's a pay as you go. And there's certainly upside there, depending on how quickly they deploy, how best they deploy. And we do see in the U.S. that things are continuing to heat up. We're expecting north of $30 billion once again in terms of carrier CapEx and that bodes very well for our short-term as well as long-term tenant leases here. So we -- and we're excited about 5G in the U.S. and all the C-band spectrum that's been auctioned off and that is out there that will eventually be deployed and we're seeing lots of activity as well.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glad you guys are doing well. I hope you continue to stay well. A couple of questions. First, I appreciate the color on what your assumption is as far as the equity component, about half of the $10 billion total, about $5 billion equity rates common as an assumption. How should we think about the gating factors of what would -- what are you waiting for to go to market? Obviously, there's some overhang on the stock as we wait for the offering. How should we think about what are the gating factors on go-to-market? And update us a little bit on what might be going on with private capital in that aspect.\nTom Bartlett: Sure, Ric. So the gating item is really sorting through the kind of the different options that we have ahead of us. There may be an element of common equity that we deploy here. And for modeling purposes, for outlook purposes, we are assuming that it's half of the $10 billion. Certainly, when you think about that equity offering, we did go through a tender offer. That tender offer resulted in us closing right at the end of the year and then we deal with open windows and closed windows and when, as a company, we can go out to market. And that kind of pushed us into January which was beyond Q4. And then looking at the way Q4 rolled out, we couldn't go out with equity at that point. So there's a lot of complicating factors kind of in there. But certainly, we have windows that open up here shortly and then again in Q2. But with that said, we're focused on the long-term value creation from CoreSite which is a high-quality, very interconnected network and cloud-centric set of assets that we think, over the long term, is going to drive a lot of value. So we want to make sure that we put the right financing together. And if that takes a little bit more time to get the right pieces put together, then that's what we'll do. And with that said, the common equity that we have in the assumption is an assumption. We're also out looking at private capital partnerships. We're also looking at mandatory convertible preferred instruments. And we'll make the best decisions based on market conditions, terms and conditions of any potential private capital and we'll make those decisions. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, always with the -- in the best interest of the shareholders in mind and minimizing dilution is always important to us. So we take that very seriously. And then also making sure whatever we do stay solidly within the framework of investment-grade credit. That's another thing that's very important to us.\nRic Prentiss: A lot in the calculus. I want to follow up on one of Simon's questions also. As Tom, you mentioned there's a lot of portfolios discussed out there. What about other asset classes, fiber, data centers, beside towers in Europe or other venues, how interested are you in fibers or data centers outside the U.S.? And we get the question a lot with CoreSite, do you need to spend a lot on kind of replicating in Europe the data center concept of what you've gotten with CoreSite?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. No, thanks, Ric. I mean outside of the United States, our focuses are clearly tower portfolio. We do have some initiatives going on with regards to fiber down in Latin America. We actually do have some smaller data centers, candidly down in -- down in Latin America as well on a very small scale. The reason for, clearly, the CoreSite acquisition was really in the United States, that's where we think that edge grid is really going to be developed first. And we'll look at that as clearly the market to develop that strategy and then evaluate options to be able to expand that, to the extent that it makes sense outside of the United States. So the platforms that we're really seeking outside are largely driven by the tower. We have a lot of tower and fuel initiatives going on, particularly in Africa as well as in India. So we consider that a platform extension, if you will, Ric, where we're really trying to reduce the overall carbon footprint, improve the quality of the site, reduce our overall diesel consumption similar to -- really consistent with what we're trying to do with our science-based targets but offering even more value to our customers through our more efficient power and fuel initiatives. But we will really develop the kind of that data center model, the interconnected model with our tower portfolio within the United States. And so outside of the United States, it clearly is a tower focus.\nRic Prentiss: Great, that helps. Appreciate it guys. Stay well.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Ric.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just if I could do a couple of quick ones. I guess, first, Tom, could you maybe talk us through, at the end of the day, who the new leadership team is for the CoreSite asset? And then, Rod, just to follow up on Ric's question. Given the valuation you guys paid was very strategic and a kind of a very competitive process and the markets pulled back, is it plausible to believe that there is private capital out there that would want to pay what you paid for a stake in that business? And then I guess my last follow-up, if I could, Rod, was you mentioned that you're going to be getting some termination fees coming from Latin America. Could you kind of put some numbers around that for 2022?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, Dave, I'll just take the first one. It's a quick one. I mean Steve Vondran, who is President of our U.S. business, is responsible for the CoreSite investment in the business. Juan Font who is within the business, who's a terrific leader, is actually responsible for running the CoreSite business, working directly for Steve? Rod.\nRod Smith: Yes and David, I'll tackle the next two. So on the private capital side, yes, I think it's absolutely plausible to think that there are investors out there that see the long-term value and value creation within the CoreSite assets. We do believe that the CoreSite set of assets is amongst and of the highest quality portfolio of highly interconnected, cloud-centric, network-centric data center-type assets out in the U.S. and they're strategically placed across the country from West Coast to Central, over to the East Coast as well. So the locations are perfect in terms of being able to tie into lots of our towers across the globe. So as we look at this and we look through kind of short-term volatility in the equity markets as well as even with interest rates and things like that, I think it's very plausible. And we're very encouraged by the fact that there are a number of investors out there that see the long-term value and value creation here and believe in the transition of some of these data center assets into more distributed cloud on-ramps, more distributed compute power and tying that up with tower companies and the traditional tower company customers. So that's a long way of saying, yes, absolutely, I think people would be interested in this. But with that said, our options are all kind of open and on the board and we'll be evaluating that over the coming period of time. And then in terms of the termination fees, it's in the range of $40 million that you'll see kind of come through the numbers in 2022, really kind of flat with what we experienced in 2021 as well as in terms of termination fees.\nDavid Barden: All right, awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nRod Smith: Thanks, David.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. First, just to go back to data centers. We're about two months in post-deal close. I'm just wondering if you can share maybe the initial playbook for those assets, the CoreSite assets and more specifically, plans on potentially expanding the footprint beyond either the existing markets domestically or internationally. And then secondly, just to pivot to India because that's the one region I believe has not come up yet in Q&A. Can you just talk about what's driving the improvement in the outlook there in 2022? And maybe more broadly, give us any updates you're seeing in terms of the overall demand backdrop there for the carrier customers.\nTom Bartlett: Matt, let me take the first one and Rod can take the second one on India. Yes, we are. We're about two months into the transaction. CoreSite had a strong finish to 2021 and we expect even a stronger set of growth metrics for in 2022. I mean there, we're moving through the integration process, as you would expect. Rod talked about the financing element of it. And we have teams looking at all of the opportunities to create synergies between the tower business as well as the data center business. But we're going to enjoy all the underlying growth that's coming from the business itself. We're integrating the data center companies that we had, albeit on a small scale, clearly compared to CoreSite into the CoreSite business. So there are a lot of activities going on from an integration perspective. On the commercial side, there are a significant amount of customer conversations, discussions, proof of concepts that are being developed and worked through on a number of different fronts with a number of different types of customers, the cloud service providers, the MNOs. And so there are continued initiatives going on to look at the opportunities to be able to bring our vision to the market. And it's not going to happen overnight. But in the meantime, we have the ability to really enjoy the underlying growth and the positioning that CoreSite has. And they have some development that's going on within their own portfolio this year in terms of building out some of the data centers that they've got. But as I said, the underlying growth trends are greater than they were in 2021. So we're really excited about the leadership team that we've got in place and the opportunities that we're going to see -- come to fruition over the next couple of years.\nRod Smith: And Matt, in terms of your question around India, I'll hit a couple of highlights here. So in India, I think you're probably aware that the backdrop of the telecom environment is improving quite a bit and has done so in the last several -- certainly the last several quarters. The government has really stepped up and shown support for the wireless segment and the telecom segment. In addition, the carriers themselves have increased the tariff. So there, they've got healthier businesses as they go forward. And specifically to Voda, you've seen probably just recently even their intentions to monetize part of their stake in the India's portfolio to improve liquidity. They also chose to have some of the interest on their spectrum do's and their AGR fees going back to transitioning that from a liability to the government and swapping it for some equity. So they've greatly improved kind of their balance sheet. And now they have a much longer runway. Really, the whole sector has a much longer runway to kind of sort through the environment there. Because of those things, we are seeing churn subside in the marketplace and we've seen that over the last several years. So in India, specifically, we're guiding to 2% to 3% positive organic tenant billings growth. That comes with 5% gross organic growth, a 2% escalator which is contractual throughout all of our leases there and about 4.5% churn. That churn rate is down from over 10% in 2021. So that's where you see sort of the biggest improvement there. And the other thing I would say is we think the India marketplace is going to be very constructive here over the long term. Certainly, there's a large population. The networks are in early stage of development. They need a lot more infrastructure and the Indian subscribers really do consume lots of data in there. So we think that the market is still trying to absorb some of these positive changes that they've seen. And once that happens and all the carriers kind of get used to the new environment there, we should see churn continue to decline over time as well as gross new business increase over time. And those are the things that kind of get us back to that upper single-digit growth rate potentially. But as of now, we're fairly cautious around India in terms of our outlook and projections. And even in the long-term guide that Tom talked about earlier, that 10% AFFO per share growth, we have fairly modest improvements built in there for India, not getting back up to that full upper single-digit growth rate. So there's upside from that perspective if India continues to improve over the coming quarters and years.\nMatt Niknam: Very helpful. Thank you, Rod.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Awesome. Thank you for taking the question. You guys gave the $150 million in colocation amendment guidance for the U.S. business in '22. It's clearly up year-over-year but still well below 2018 and 2019. I was hoping you could help us understand the primary differences between what was happening in 2018 and 2019 versus your 2022 guidance and maybe where we're going. Then in relation to that $150 million number specifically, could you help us understand what percentage of that is fully contracted versus your expectations for billings coming in more \u00e0 la carte?\nRod Smith: Sure, Brandon. So in terms of looking backwards to 2018, I don't want to go through too much detail between the two. But certainly, back in 2018, there was an explosion of activity in the U.S. from all the carriers. That was a time when we had all the carriers, including Sprint, investing heavily and contributing to our revenues in a pretty heavy way. So Sprint was a big contributor back then. And it was at a time when AT&T was also aggressively building out the FirstNet network. So those two things were kind of unique around 2018 and those aren't repeating. So we're very happy with where we are in terms of the colocation amendment contributions in 2022. We do see that accelerating into the back half of 2022 and we expect that acceleration to continue going out. And again, a lot of that growth, even beyond '22, is contracted in the holistic MLAs that we have. So we have visibility to that growth. So we do think we're entering a multiyear cycle of acceleration when it comes to that organic new biz, the colocation and amendment piece of it. And what was the other question that you had? The $150 million...\nTom Bartlett: Rod, I would just...\nRod Smith: Would you like to add on?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, I would just add on that one particular piece. When you think about kind of '17, '18, '19, it was kind of at the latter end of kind of the heavy 4G investments. And you would typically see that with new technologies going in place. So my sense is that that's what we would start to see when we think about 5G. We're just in the early stages. The carriers are starting to clear and roll out C-band. I mean, we'll start to see it even the end of this year when we start to get into ramp up on the organic growth rates. But as 5G takes hold and continues to develop and densifies, we would expect that similar type of growth ramp up clearly with 5G. And yes, as Rod said, Sprint was very active back at that point in time, obviously, not around any longer. But with DISH now in it's place, hopefully, they would be able to be that kind of fourth agent there and really driving that kind of growth.\nRod Smith: And Brandon, I think your other question was around the percentage of the $150 million that was contracted; it's in around 3/4.\nBrandon Nispel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks very much. So in the slide deck, you talked about Telxius driving a lot of growth in international. I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on contributions and which particular markets that, that came from? And then maybe related to the very first question around M&A but you talked a lot about kind of 5G and edge. And I wondered how does that affect your prospective CapEx profile across which sorts of assets? You also have fiber which hasn't come up a lot on this call in LatAm, for instance. So across assets and regions, how does 5G and Edge kind of affect your incremental CapEx going forward as well as affecting the types of assets that you might look at a little bit more seriously going forward compared to in the past?\nTom Bartlett: Sure. No, Jonathan, I mean let me start and Rod can add in. But from a European perspective, clearly, much of the growth is coming in Germany, where they've been very aggressive in terms of rolling out 5G as well as in Spain. So I mean those are our two critical markets there. But Germany is really going to be, I think, really driving a lot of it and we're seeing a lot of activity in Spain as well. From a CapEx perspective, maybe you can take a look at even our projections for 2022. I mean, it's largely driven by our tower portfolio. There are certain development activities within the data center assets in the United States building out but it pales in comparison to what we're expecting on the tower CapEx side. We're looking at a major generator rollout for a large customer in the United States which is a piece of it. And we're also looking to build another 6,000 to 7,000 sites. So if you look at over the last several years, we've built probably cumulatively about 20,000 sites and we have significant expectations for continuing that kind of a trend and '22 is no different. And so as 4G and as 5G is developed around the world, we continue to see the need for new build-to-suits and that is the best use of our capital. With regards to fiber and some of the other assets, John, I'd tell you it's de minimis. I mean it's very, very small. And in many cases, they were just science projects, where we're still trying to see if there's really an opportunity in those markets. But -- and I would see that trend candidly for the next several years, that the direction for capital is going to be driven to the tower base of assets, again, largely driven to the development side of building out new sites and very little spend on some of the fiber portfolios or fiber assets outside of the United States. And John...\nJonathan Atkin: Go ahead, yes.\nRod Smith: Sorry, Jonathan, I'll hit the question on Europe and Telxius. So as you saw from the prepared remarks and in the slides, we are looking at about 9% organic tenant billings growth in Europe; so a real strong upper single-digit number. That compares to 2021 which was around 5%; a couple of the drivers there. We are seeing solid organic new biz up around 6% or so for the market. The escalators are up a bit, so we're up at around 4.5%. Escalators, the churn is down from 2.4 in 2021 down to 1.4 in 2022. A lot of that is directly driven by the Telxius assets which are very low to no churn assets the way the contracts are written and kind of from a structural standpoint. So that reduction in churn, at 100 basis points, you can really ascribe back to Telxius. And that gives you the 9% organic growth rate. I would say, we're seeing our best growth here in Germany. But even if you pull away the Telxius assets that are adding to the overall growth here, we're still seeing north of 6% or so of growth in the legacy business kind of across Europe. A couple of things that I would point out. In terms of the 9%, we do expect that to moderate throughout the year and be lower in the back half of the year after we kind of lap having Telxius on for a full year. So we're looking at about 7% organic growth in the back half of 2021. And then beyond that, we are looking at Europe not being at 9% but being kind of in that mid-single digits and upper single digits. So in Germany, we're still looking at 6% to 7% organic tenant billings growth in that market. And across all of Europe, we're looking at mid-single digits, let's call it, 5% to 6% organic growth in Europe even beyond 2022.\nJonathan Atkin: And then just in terms of potential private capital partnerships, any kind of a refresh that you could give us on just the criteria that you would have from, whether it's a governance standpoint or strategic, what they bring strategically to the table or the financial criteria that you employ when you evaluate potential private capital partners?\nRod Smith: Yes, Jonathan, I'll keep it at a fairly high level here. And I don't want to over emphasize the private capital or any of these different elements because we're still working through the process. And when we do land on our optimal financial plan here, we'll let you know. But in terms of our criteria, we certainly look well beyond just capital. So as we did with Telxius, we want to know that we've got world-class, large investors with us that have the same or similar mindset around the specific assets, the region and the future of those assets. Because additional capital and really having a partner that wants to grow in terms of this asset, it's going to be around exploiting this asset in terms of that cloud distribution, that heavy interconnection and then eventually moving to the edge or the metro edge. So we certainly want someone at the table with us that has a similar vision there, that is excited about that and again, doesn't get too wrapped up in a short-term equity volatility but see for long-term investment. And certainly, the investors that we would talk to, just like in the Telxius process, are long-term investors. They're 15-year to 30-year investors. They're not 5-years and also that's what we -- that's what we wanted. And we also really like investors that are very experienced and investing. We like having people at the table with us talking about ways to grow, how to grow. And we find a real value to that. So I would just maybe emphasize the fact that our partnerships in Europe with CDPQ, Allianz and PGGM has been very good for us, not just for the capital but for a lot of other reasons. So we couldn't be more pleased with the way that partnership has unfolded. And if we were to do something in the U.S., it would be -- we would be equally as optimistic around the good relationship, the shared vision and those sorts of things. And of course, governance in terms and conditions are always important to us in value. It's something we take seriously. So we'll certainly be working through that but that will be a criteria that will be on the table.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. Two quick follow-ups. Can you provide the geographic mix of the 6,500 new builds this year? And just the -- on the U.S., $150 million of new colo amendment. What's the colo versus amendment mix? And how should we think about the pacing through the year?\nRod Smith: Yes, Batya. So I'll hit the first one here for you. So we're looking at around, for 2022, about 6,500 new builds. As in the past, it's heavily concentrated in the India region. So north of 4,000 roughly and these will be rough numbers in India. The next largest region is going to be in Africa which is going to be in the range of 1,900 or so, then we drop. And Latin America and Europe are pretty equal at around 500 sites each. And I'll just remind you that in Europe, we're building a lot of towers there through the Telxius transaction, came with a 10-year build-to-suit commitment of 3,000 sites over that time period. So we're actively building those assets. We're also building assets for Orange across Europe which the way they show up in our numbers, it kind of comes through as more in terms of an acquisition because they build them and kind of flipping to us but it really is sort of a build-to-suit program as well. So we couldn't be more pleased with the way that our build-to-suit program is working and unfolding. We continue to see double-digit NOI yields kind of across the mix here of all these regions which is really good. So we are solidly kind of on track to hit that 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that Tom had talked about in the past. And then in terms of your other question, when it comes to the split between amendments and colos, there's not a lot of detail that I'll get into from that perspective. A lot of our revenue is under the MLA agreements which again is more used rights than fixed fees and not so much ascribed to a colo versant amendment. We're still seeing heavy amendments in the industry by and large. Certainly, there's one carrier that might be a little bit more weighted towards co-location. But we're still seeing in terms of the activity level, heavily weighted towards amendments but I wouldn't want to try to split the $150 million because that's not the way that our contracts work in terms of the revenue.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: And speakers, I'll turn the conference back to you for any closing comments.\nTom Bartlett: Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. I know there's a lot of news around the world. I hope you all stay safe and well. And again, just appreciate you all being here this morning. To the extent you have any further follow-ups, please give us a call. We are clearly by the phones waiting to talk. So, thank you all.\nRod Smith: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are well. As you just heard from Tom, American Tower had another year of solid performance which included strong Q4 results throughout our global business. Before we dive into the details of our expectations for 2022, I'll briefly review our Q4 and full year 2021 results. To start, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year. First, 2021 marked another year of strong overachievement against our initial AFFO per share targets. For the full year, we posted consolidated and attributable AFFO per share growth of 13.7% and 11.7%, respectively. This is a demonstration of our ability to deliver solid total revenue growth, tightly manage operating costs and execute on strategically important M&A transactions, all while maintaining a thoughtful and disciplined approach to our capital structure. I'll also note, this is a great start towards achieving our previously stated objective of delivering, on average, double-digit AFFO per share growth between 2021 and 2027. Second, we delivered our third consecutive year of record new builds. As we've discussed previously, these newly constructed sites continue to be amongst our best uses of capital. And in 2021, we saw average day 1 NOI yield of nearly 12% over the nearly 6,400 sites we constructed. Finally, during 2021, we completed two strategic M&A transactions and, as a result, strengthened our position in the United States and Europe, two critically important markets for us. With that, let's dive into the details of our Q4 and full year 2021 results. Turning to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated property revenues grew by more than 13% year-over-year or over 14% on an FX-neutral basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, property revenue grew 1.2%. This included an organic tenant billings growth decline of 0.5% or an increase of over 4% when excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. As a reminder, over half of the total Sprint churn commenced in 2021, primarily on October 1, as expected. International property revenues grew over 28%, with nearly 20% driven by contributions from our Telxius assets. International organic tenant billings growth was 5.7%, led by Latin America at 7.4%, followed by Africa at 7.3% and Europe at 6.6%. APAC grew for the second consecutive quarter, coming in at 1.3%. This was complemented by the addition of nearly 1,900 high-yielding, newly constructed sites across our international markets. Moving to adjusted EBITDA; growth was over 10% in the quarter, while the impacts of Sprint churn, combined with the addition of newer, lower-tenancy assets, drove a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 62%. Finally, consolidated AFFO per share grew 3.8% in the quarter or 4.3%, excluding the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. This included nearly $140 million of year-on-year cash-adjusted EBITDA growth which was partially offset by the higher net cash interest expense, along with higher cash taxes and maintenance costs. As anticipated, the timing of these expenses was heavily back-end weighted in 2021, resulting in a material impact to the year-over-year growth rates in Q4. Meanwhile, AFFO per share attributable to American Tower common stockholders grew by 1.4% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was 14.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 3.8% and total tenant billings growth of 11.3%. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was nearly 9%, with organic tenant billings growth of 2.9%. This included contributions from co-locations and amendments of 3.2%; another 3% in growth from escalators; around 0.2% in negative impacts from other run rate items; and churn of 3% which consisted of around 1.8% in normal cost churn and the balance driven by Sprint. This was complemented by new asset contributions to tenant billings of 4.1% and approximately $144 million in higher straight-line revenues as compared to 2020. Our international property revenue grew by over 21% with organic tenant billings growth of 5.5% for the year. Overall colocation and amendment growth was 5.9%, while 3.8% came from escalators and 0.3% from other run rate items, all of which was partially offset by 4.5% of churn. This elevated churn was primarily concentrated in India, where more recently, we have started to see the churn rate moderate. Finally, with our recent expanded data center portfolio, we have introduced a new data center segment within total property, consisting of the newly acquired CoreSite and DataSite assets along with our existing Colo ATL facility. This segment contributed approximately $23 million to our total property revenue in 2021. Turning to Slide 10; adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the year to nearly $6 billion. This included strong flow-through of organic tenant billings growth; $100 million in incremental services gross margin versus 2020; over $140 million in net straight-line growth, as well as around $300 million in contributions to growth from newly acquired assets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 20 basis points as compared to 2020, primarily due to the impacts of Sprint churn in the U.S. and the addition of newer lower tenancy international assets which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time. We also grew consolidated AFFO by 15.4% and consolidated AFFO per share by 13.7% in 2021, with over $680 million in cash adjusted EBITDA growth from the drivers I just mentioned. This growth was partially offset by higher financing costs associated with our recent strategic M&A as well as a modest increase in maintenance CapEx and higher cash tax expense as compared to 2020. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share grew 11.7% year-over-year. With that, let's turn to our outlook for 2022. I'll start by highlighting a few key assumptions underlying our projections. First, we expect a strong year of new leasing activity across our operations, with anticipated gross new business contributions to total tenant billings growth nearly 7% higher than what we saw in 2021. This expectation is being driven by a few key items. In the U.S., the comprehensive MLAs we've signed over the last few years are continuing to result in solid levels of new business activity. In Europe, we expect an exceptionally strong year, boosted by our larger presence following the Telxius transaction. And across our developing market footprint, the demand for site continues to rise as next-generation network deployments advance. Second, we expect churn to be higher than historical levels in 2022. In the United States, this will be driven by Sprint churn we've discussed previously, with about $160 million in year-over-year impacts in 2022 versus 2021. Additionally, in select international markets, a handful of carrier consolidation events are temporarily driving churn higher. Third, we've layered in some preliminary assumptions related to our CoreSite financing. And finally, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $125 million for property revenue, $70 million for adjusted EBITDA and $55 million for consolidated AFFO versus 2021. Moving into the details on Slide 11, you can see we expect total property revenues of over $10.3 billion at the midpoint, representing growth of 13% or nearly 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes expected property revenue growth of less than 1% in the U.S. and Canada and over 14% of FX-neutral growth in our international regions. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $705 million of growth in cash revenue to the Property segment in 2022. Turning to Slide 12 and unpacking the property revenue growth assumptions a bit, you'll see our expected organic tenant billings growth rates for 2022. I'd like to note here that our tenant billings metrics do not include contributions from the data centers segment. Looking at the United States and Canada, we anticipate growth of approximately 1%, in line with the 2022 expectations implied in the long-term projections we presented last year. This includes contributions to growth from colocations and amendments of roughly $150 million, representing solid double-digit growth versus 2021. We expect this to be partially offset by churn of over 5% which includes a 3.7% impact associated with Sprint. Turning to Latin America; we expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 6% for the year, supported by solid gross colocation and amendment activity as well as additional growth from our CPI-based escalators which we anticipate to be around 300 basis points higher than in 2021. These items are being partially offset by higher churn in 2022, primarily related to Telefonica in Mexico as well as the continuation of Nextel churn in Brazil. With both events, we expect to receive settlement payments over the course of 2022, compensating us for the early termination of leases ahead of their expiration, where applicable. As is typical, these payments will fall outside of the organic tenant billings growth metrics. Moving to Africa; organic tenant billings growth is expected to be in the 6% range. We continue to see strong demand for our macro tower assets driving colocation and amendment growth of around 6.5% for the year. In addition, we expect escalators to be up as compared to 2021 by roughly 90 basis points. This will be partially offset by an expectation for elevated churn as carrier consolidation and some smaller market exit events from Q4 of 2021 work their way through our 2022 financial metrics. Meanwhile, in Europe, we're seeing the benefits of added scale from the Telxius acquisition, the early stages of 5G rollouts and low churn, all driving expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9% in 2022. This includes roughly 6% in contributions from colocations and amendments and escalators of around 4.5%. These higher escalators are being driven by the combination of higher CPI and the mechanics of having the Telxius assets in our numbers for the full year of 2022. Churn is expected to decline to around 1.5% as we benefit from the lower-churn Telxius assets and reduced cancellations across our legacy business as carrier consolidation events wind down. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we're guiding to 2% to 3% organic tenant billings growth in 2022, including churn of around 5%, representing less than half of the 2021 churn rate. At the same time, our outlook does imply a reduction to gross colocation and amendment growth contributions relative to 2021 levels as carriers in the marketplace continue to digest recent developments. With that said, we are encouraged by the market reforms aimed at improving the overall health of the telecom sector as well as more recent steps taken by the carriers to rationalize pricing and improve overall profitability in the marketplace. We think these steps could bode well for the long-term growth picture in India. Turning to Slide 13; at the midpoint of our outlook, we're projecting adjusted EBITDA of over $6.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10% or nearly 11% on a constant currency basis. We continue to drive solid organic growth conversion rates and are complementing this through growth on assets acquired in 2021, including approximately $360 million in expected adjusted EBITDA from CoreSite in 2022. We are seeing some margin compression in 2022. This is primarily the result of Sprint churn in the U.S., along with the full year impact of the slightly lower-margin CoreSite and Telxius assets. That said, the benefits of our continued focus on operational efficiency are taking hold in our regional legacy businesses, particularly in Africa, where our commitment to sustainable energy solutions and strong cost controls are driving meaningful expansions in margins. Turning to Slide 14; we expect consolidated AFFO to grow by more than $380 million to over $4.7 billion, despite absorbing approximately $160 million in negative impacts to AFFO from Sprint churn. This includes $675 million in FX-neutral cash-adjusted EBITDA growth and the expectation for maintenance CapEx to be more or less flat as compared to 2021 as capital intensity remains in the 2% range. We expect this to be partially offset by approximately $55 million in higher cash taxes and $185 million in incremental cash interest expense, primarily associated with our preliminary CoreSite financing assumption as well as roughly $55 million in expected negative translational FX impacts. Additionally, we've layered in a common stock issuance assumption for the purposes of outlook in the first half of 2022, again, tied to the CoreSite transaction. Taking these assumptions into account, we expect our consolidated AFFO per share for the year to be $10.05, reflecting growth of 4%, or roughly 8%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders is expected to grow approximately 3% year-over-year to $9.70 per share in 2022. This includes an assumption of approximately $165 million in minority interest impacts related to our partnerships in Europe. Moving on to Slide 15, let's review our capital deployment in 2021 and expectations for 2022. In 2021, we declared nearly $2.4 billion of common dividend distributions, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. We spent another $1.4 billion through our CapEx programs, over $500 million of which was dedicated to our development projects, including the construction of nearly 6,400 new sites across the globe. Finally, we deployed over $20 billion, including the assumption of debt to acquire the Telxius and CoreSite assets as well as a handful of smaller transactions around the world. We expect these new assets to drive meaningful accretion and shareholder value over time. Looking to 2022, our dividend remains a top priority. And subject to board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $2.8 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to increase the dividend in line with our stated long-term, double-digit growth targets. We also expect to deploy roughly $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, over 90% of which will be discretionary. Of our total discretionary capital spending, we expect approximately $270 million to be directed towards attractive organic development opportunities in our data center segment. On the tower side, we expect to deploy roughly $565 million in development CapEx, primarily for the construction of 6,500 sites in our International segment. Similar to 2021, we anticipate driving average day 1 NOI yields on these new builds of nearly 12%. As you can see on the chart to the right, these international new site investments have driven exceptional returns over time. In our earliest vintage, we're seeing average NOI yields of 46%. Sites built between 2010 and 2014 are yielding around 26%. And on the more than 26,000 sites we've constructed since the start of 2015, we're seeing yields in the 20% range, with room to expand as we continue to drive lease-up on these lower-tenured sites. Looking forward, we believe our international new-build program presents a significant opportunity to continue adding meaningful portfolio scale while achieving highly attractive returns. And we'll continue to prioritize site development opportunities as a key part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term. Turning now to Slide 16, we've laid out our current thoughts around the permanent financing strategy for our CoreSite acquisition. As always, the primary objective is for us to finance this transaction in a way that optimizes our capital structure within our investment-grade framework, minimizes dilution to our common stockholders and positions us to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in ways that maximize value creation for our shareholders over the long term. At a high level, we expect to get there through a combination of debt and equity issuances. The debt markets remain attractive. And as we have done in the past, we expect to be opportunistic as we seek to term out revolver and term loan borrowings into longer-term fixed rate instruments. On the equity side, we anticipate evaluating a number of alternatives, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferreds and private capital partnerships, much like we did for the Telxius acquisition in 2021. With that said, for the purposes of our initial 2022 outlook, we have assumed that roughly half of the $10 billion purchase price will be financed through a common equity issuance assumed to occur in the first half of 2022. As you can see on the slide, we anticipate that this will bring our leverage back down to the high 5x range while putting us on track to get back to 5x or below over the slightly longer term. Importantly, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and have been working closely with the rating agencies throughout this process. As we continue to evaluate a number of potential options, particularly on the equity side, we will plan to keep you all updated as to our progress. In the meantime, we believe that the baseline case we have incorporated in our current outlook positions us well as we create long-term shareholder value with the CoreSite assets. Turning now to Slide 17 and in summary, we drove strong results in 2021, including compelling double-digit AFFO per share growth, record new build activity prudent, balance sheet management and the completion of several transactions that we believe will enhance American Tower's leading global position. As we look across our global footprint, we're encouraged by what we see as a long tailwind of secular technology trends that are expected to drive continued strong recurring demand for our critical communication infrastructure assets. In the U.S. and Europe, we're well positioned to support a continued acceleration in 5G activity as carriers deploy new spectrum assets and build out greenfield networks. Meanwhile, in our early-stage markets, we expect to benefit as operators look to upgrade and densify their mobile networks to meet ever-increasing mobile data demand, all of which we believe will translate into meaningful growth and attractive total shareholder returns at American Tower for many years to come. And with that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions. Simon, thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well. So in Latin America, just to recap here, we're guiding towards just above 6% organic tenant billings growth. And that's really driven by solid organic new bids. So we've got about 3.3% or so contributing from an organic new builds perspective. And we're also seeing outsized escalators. So we've got escalators in above 8% in that market. So nice strong escalators there. And that really is sort of an inflation hedge that we have in the Latin American markets. But we are seeing temporary elevated churn. So we've got about 5% churn coming out of Latin America. The churn that's in the outlook for 2022 is primarily Telefonica up in Mexico and then Nextel down in Brazil. Oi doesn't really play into the equation quite yet. We do have a long-term contract with Oi. So that will play out over the next seven years or so. And we'll see where that goes. I don't want to get ahead of anything that may happen in the market there from a regulatory perspective. But it's not really a main component in our 2022 numbers and we've got protection there out over seven years. And the Oi revenue is in and around 1% of our total revenue. Nice to have you on the call. Thanks for joining us and thanks for the question. So the U.S. market in terms of organic growth or organic new builds is really quite strong. We continue to see all of the major carriers being very active. And the place that, that shows up initially, maybe as an early indicator here, is within our services business. So once again, we're guiding towards services revenue above $220 million, so still well above kind of historical levels, a little bit below where we were in 2021 but still a nice solid level of services activity. And the margins there are still coming in at 55% right where they normally do. And then when you think about the U.S. organic growth here, we're guiding towards 1% or so. And I'll give you the piece parts there. So organic new business is slightly up from where it was from the prior year in terms of a percentage basis; so that's about 3.3%. Escalators are holding very firm, slightly ahead of where they were in 2021. They're coming in at 3.1%. And then we have cancellations coming in at about five -- a little over 5% and that is primarily driven -- at least the outsized churn there is primarily driven through the Sprint churn that we've all talked about. In terms of going forward, you do know that we've got MLAs with most of our carriers, where we've got kind of lock-in revenue as well as revenue growth. So 3/4 of the ramp is in there. Even in our long-term guide, we do have about 2/3 or so of not only the underlying revenue in the guide but the actual growth locked up in MLA. So nice really clear visibility in terms of the growth that we see going out. We do have one customer that's on an \u00e0 la carte basis. So as they begin to deploy, we do expect that to ramp towards the back half of the year. And we also have the agreement with DISH which we've talked about in the past, that is beginning to produce revenue for us this year. That will escalate through the year, so we'll see a ramp-up during the year from that. And then it will continue to ramp over time. And that's what really gives us the confidence to put out the long-term growth rates that Tom talked about and getting back up into that mid-single-digit growth rate sustainably in the U.S. And then the final point that I would make is the colocation and amendment contributions to organic new business. For the year, we're guiding around $150 -- $150 million. And that's up from the level in 2021 which is close to about $130 million or so. And that represents a solid 15% year-on-year growth rate. So we're quite pleased with what we see in the U.S. from a gross growth. And the churn that we're seeing is temporary will subside and then we think growth will return into that mid-single digits in the U.S. over the long term. No, I think when you think about the MLAs that we have, it's based on use rights and a use-right fee that's all incorporated. So to the extent that their activity level fits within the use right bucket, then it's covered. To the extent that their activity level goes beyond what was contemplated and what was granted to them in the use right, then that would be upside. And certainly, anyone that's on an \u00e0 la carte basis, it's a pay as you go. And there's certainly upside there, depending on how quickly they deploy, how best they deploy. And we do see in the U.S. that things are continuing to heat up. We're expecting north of $30 billion once again in terms of carrier CapEx and that bodes very well for our short-term as well as long-term tenant leases here. So we -- and we're excited about 5G in the U.S. and all the C-band spectrum that's been auctioned off and that is out there that will eventually be deployed and we're seeing lots of activity as well. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Ric. Yes and David, I'll tackle the next two. So on the private capital side, yes, I think it's absolutely plausible to think that there are investors out there that see the long-term value and value creation within the CoreSite assets. We do believe that the CoreSite set of assets is amongst and of the highest quality portfolio of highly interconnected, cloud-centric, network-centric data center-type assets out in the U.S. and they're strategically placed across the country from West Coast to Central, over to the East Coast as well. So the locations are perfect in terms of being able to tie into lots of our towers across the globe. So as we look at this and we look through kind of short-term volatility in the equity markets as well as even with interest rates and things like that, I think it's very plausible. And we're very encouraged by the fact that there are a number of investors out there that see the long-term value and value creation here and believe in the transition of some of these data center assets into more distributed cloud on-ramps, more distributed compute power and tying that up with tower companies and the traditional tower company customers. So that's a long way of saying, yes, absolutely, I think people would be interested in this. But with that said, our options are all kind of open and on the board and we'll be evaluating that over the coming period of time. And then in terms of the termination fees, it's in the range of $40 million that you'll see kind of come through the numbers in 2022, really kind of flat with what we experienced in 2021 as well as in terms of termination fees. Thanks, David. And Matt, in terms of your question around India, I'll hit a couple of highlights here. So in India, I think you're probably aware that the backdrop of the telecom environment is improving quite a bit and has done so in the last several -- certainly the last several quarters. The government has really stepped up and shown support for the wireless segment and the telecom segment. In addition, the carriers themselves have increased the tariff. So there, they've got healthier businesses as they go forward. And specifically to Voda, you've seen probably just recently even their intentions to monetize part of their stake in the India's portfolio to improve liquidity. They also chose to have some of the interest on their spectrum do's and their AGR fees going back to transitioning that from a liability to the government and swapping it for some equity. So they've greatly improved kind of their balance sheet. And now they have a much longer runway. Really, the whole sector has a much longer runway to kind of sort through the environment there. Because of those things, we are seeing churn subside in the marketplace and we've seen that over the last several years. So in India, specifically, we're guiding to 2% to 3% positive organic tenant billings growth. That comes with 5% gross organic growth, a 2% escalator which is contractual throughout all of our leases there and about 4.5% churn. That churn rate is down from over 10% in 2021. So that's where you see sort of the biggest improvement there. And the other thing I would say is we think the India marketplace is going to be very constructive here over the long term. Certainly, there's a large population. The networks are in early stage of development. They need a lot more infrastructure and the Indian subscribers really do consume lots of data in there. So we think that the market is still trying to absorb some of these positive changes that they've seen. And once that happens and all the carriers kind of get used to the new environment there, we should see churn continue to decline over time as well as gross new business increase over time. And those are the things that kind of get us back to that upper single-digit growth rate potentially. But as of now, we're fairly cautious around India in terms of our outlook and projections. And even in the long-term guide that Tom talked about earlier, that 10% AFFO per share growth, we have fairly modest improvements built in there for India, not getting back up to that full upper single-digit growth rate. So there's upside from that perspective if India continues to improve over the coming quarters and years. You're welcome. Sure, Brandon. So in terms of looking backwards to 2018, I don't want to go through too much detail between the two. But certainly, back in 2018, there was an explosion of activity in the U.S. from all the carriers. That was a time when we had all the carriers, including Sprint, investing heavily and contributing to our revenues in a pretty heavy way. So Sprint was a big contributor back then. And it was at a time when AT&T was also aggressively building out the FirstNet network. So those two things were kind of unique around 2018 and those aren't repeating. So we're very happy with where we are in terms of the colocation amendment contributions in 2022. We do see that accelerating into the back half of 2022 and we expect that acceleration to continue going out. And again, a lot of that growth, even beyond '22, is contracted in the holistic MLAs that we have. So we have visibility to that growth. So we do think we're entering a multiyear cycle of acceleration when it comes to that organic new biz, the colocation and amendment piece of it. And what was the other question that you had? The $150 million... Would you like to add on? And Brandon, I think your other question was around the percentage of the $150 million that was contracted; it's in around 3/4. Sorry, Jonathan, I'll hit the question on Europe and Telxius. So as you saw from the prepared remarks and in the slides, we are looking at about 9% organic tenant billings growth in Europe; so a real strong upper single-digit number. That compares to 2021 which was around 5%; a couple of the drivers there. We are seeing solid organic new biz up around 6% or so for the market. The escalators are up a bit, so we're up at around 4.5%. Escalators, the churn is down from 2.4 in 2021 down to 1.4 in 2022. A lot of that is directly driven by the Telxius assets which are very low to no churn assets the way the contracts are written and kind of from a structural standpoint. So that reduction in churn, at 100 basis points, you can really ascribe back to Telxius. And that gives you the 9% organic growth rate. I would say, we're seeing our best growth here in Germany. But even if you pull away the Telxius assets that are adding to the overall growth here, we're still seeing north of 6% or so of growth in the legacy business kind of across Europe. A couple of things that I would point out. In terms of the 9%, we do expect that to moderate throughout the year and be lower in the back half of the year after we kind of lap having Telxius on for a full year. So we're looking at about 7% organic growth in the back half of 2021. And then beyond that, we are looking at Europe not being at 9% but being kind of in that mid-single digits and upper single digits. So in Germany, we're still looking at 6% to 7% organic tenant billings growth in that market. And across all of Europe, we're looking at mid-single digits, let's call it, 5% to 6% organic growth in Europe even beyond 2022. Yes, Jonathan, I'll keep it at a fairly high level here. And I don't want to over emphasize the private capital or any of these different elements because we're still working through the process. And when we do land on our optimal financial plan here, we'll let you know. But in terms of our criteria, we certainly look well beyond just capital. So as we did with Telxius, we want to know that we've got world-class, large investors with us that have the same or similar mindset around the specific assets, the region and the future of those assets. Because additional capital and really having a partner that wants to grow in terms of this asset, it's going to be around exploiting this asset in terms of that cloud distribution, that heavy interconnection and then eventually moving to the edge or the metro edge. So we certainly want someone at the table with us that has a similar vision there, that is excited about that and again, doesn't get too wrapped up in a short-term equity volatility but see for long-term investment. And certainly, the investors that we would talk to, just like in the Telxius process, are long-term investors. They're 15-year to 30-year investors. They're not 5-years and also that's what we -- that's what we wanted. And we also really like investors that are very experienced and investing. We like having people at the table with us talking about ways to grow, how to grow. And we find a real value to that. So I would just maybe emphasize the fact that our partnerships in Europe with CDPQ, Allianz and PGGM has been very good for us, not just for the capital but for a lot of other reasons. So we couldn't be more pleased with the way that partnership has unfolded. And if we were to do something in the U.S., it would be -- we would be equally as optimistic around the good relationship, the shared vision and those sorts of things. And of course, governance in terms and conditions are always important to us in value. It's something we take seriously. So we'll certainly be working through that but that will be a criteria that will be on the table. You're welcome. Yes, Batya. So I'll hit the first one here for you. So we're looking at around, for 2022, about 6,500 new builds. As in the past, it's heavily concentrated in the India region. So north of 4,000 roughly and these will be rough numbers in India. The next largest region is going to be in Africa which is going to be in the range of 1,900 or so, then we drop. And Latin America and Europe are pretty equal at around 500 sites each. And I'll just remind you that in Europe, we're building a lot of towers there through the Telxius transaction, came with a 10-year build-to-suit commitment of 3,000 sites over that time period. So we're actively building those assets. We're also building assets for Orange across Europe which the way they show up in our numbers, it kind of comes through as more in terms of an acquisition because they build them and kind of flipping to us but it really is sort of a build-to-suit program as well. So we couldn't be more pleased with the way that our build-to-suit program is working and unfolding. We continue to see double-digit NOI yields kind of across the mix here of all these regions which is really good. So we are solidly kind of on track to hit that 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that Tom had talked about in the past. And then in terms of your other question, when it comes to the split between amendments and colos, there's not a lot of detail that I'll get into from that perspective. A lot of our revenue is under the MLA agreements which again is more used rights than fixed fees and not so much ascribed to a colo versant amendment. We're still seeing heavy amendments in the industry by and large. Certainly, there's one carrier that might be a little bit more weighted towards co-location. But we're still seeing in terms of the activity level, heavily weighted towards amendments but I wouldn't want to try to split the $150 million because that's not the way that our contracts work in terms of the revenue. You're welcome. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we generated strong results in 2021, while strategically deploying capital to assets that we believe will further enhance our future growth trajectory and augment our ability to continue to deliver compelling total shareholder returns for many years to come. The strength of our operational and financial results reflects the high-quality nature of our tower business model, the dedication of our talented global teams and our commitment to provide best-in-class service to our customers. It also reflects our commitment to sustainability and being a good corporate citizen which provides additional purpose and continues to be a focus at every level of the organization. Last year at this time, we presented multiyear targets for U.S. organic tenant billings growth and AFFO per share growth. And I'm pleased to be able to say that we're exactly where we thought we would be today as it relates to those targets. We continue to expect to average at least 4% in U.S. organic tenant billings growth from 2021 through 2027 on a reported basis, implying an average of at least 5%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. And as part of these projections, we anticipate an acceleration in U.S. organic tenant billings growth between 2023 and 2027, when we are targeting growth rates of at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6%, excluding the Sprint churn. Similarly, on the AFFO side of the equation, we believe we are on track to average at least 10% growth in AFFO per share, on average through 2027. This includes a year of more subdued growth in 2022, as expected but also a recovery in growth rates in 2023 and beyond as the Sprint churn impacts fade and global secular growth tailwinds continue. 5G is probably the most significant of these growth drivers. And in 2021, we saw the early stages of transformational 5G network upgrades in multiple markets, including nearly $105 billion spent by U.S. carriers for critical mid-band spectrum and over $65 billion in CapEx deployed by carriers into network investments across our global footprint. With mobile data consumption expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 25% over the next five years in the United States and at even higher rates in some of our international markets, we anticipate prolonged network investment cycles to drive compelling, sustained growth rates across our regions. And while we believe our macro tower assets will continue to drive the vast majority of growth and returns for the company as 5G advances, we're also excited about additional opportunities that we expect to arise from the accelerating cloud-based interconnected and globally distributed digital transformation that is in it's early stages today. We expect our recently closed CoreSite acquisition to augment our ability to capture potential upside from this transformation while enhancing the value of our existing portfolio of distributed communications real estate over time. We anticipate these expectations to be underpinned by the continued execution of the four strategic pillars in our Stand and Deliver strategy, growing our assets and capabilities, driving industry leadership, operational efficiency and extending our platform. As part of our commitment to growing our assets and capabilities to meet our customers' needs, we deployed more than $10 billion for tower M&A in 2021 focused on Europe, where we have meaningfully improved our long-term strategic positioning. We saw accelerated organic growth trends in the region throughout the last year and we expect those trends to continue, supported by data growth projected at a CAGR of 26% over the next five years across our major European markets. Separately, we added strategic financial partners, CDPQ and Allianz, who joined our existing partner, PGGM, creating a solid platform for future growth and investment ahead of what we anticipate being an exciting decade in the European marketplace. In addition to expanding through M&A, we further grew our asset base through our internal CapEx program by investing $1.4 billion, primarily to construct a record of nearly 6,400 new communication sites, along with deploying nearly $120 million towards our energy efficiency investments, primarily in Africa. These investments continue to generate returns that are among the highest in our portfolio. Through our talented teams and operational expertise, we expect to remain a preferred partner to support customers as they execute on their network build-outs which we expect to drive continued acceleration in our new site construction for the next several years, while advancing our sustainability efforts and commitment to a greener mobile future. Through our commitment to enhance our industry leadership, we've continued our focus on sustainability by accelerating our efforts to combat climate change, as evidenced by our recent adoption of science-based targets for carbon emission reductions. These targets represent direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 40% by 2035 against the 2019 baseline, as well as targets to reduce indirect supply chain emissions by at least 40%. To date, we've invested over $275 million in CapEx towards energy efficiency and reduction solutions which directly support our committed targets and initiatives. Concurrent with our emissions reduction targets and renewable energy investments, we are actively working on various land stewardship and social impact initiatives. We're a member of the World Economic Forum's EDISON Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge which aims to spur development of affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance and education to the underserved. Through our involvement, we engaged with an array of high-level country and regional platforms and committed our time, expertise and ideas to make digital access a top priority for all. Also this past year, American Tower was awarded a 2021 World Summit on the Information Society prize for our digital communities program which spans across India, Africa and Latin America and seeks to improve the quality of life and increase economic opportunity through connectivity. At the end of 2021, we reached a significant milestone of launching our 200th digital community in India and have set a goal to grow to 2,000 digital communities globally over the next five years, focusing on education, health care access, financial inclusion and career development. Finally, we advanced our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by implementing customized plans focused on talent development, recruitment and education to enhance our inclusive culture across our global footprint. We also continued our partnership with HBCU supporting critical infrastructure enhancement projects and engaging in academic and professional development opportunities for their talented students. Further, we extended our leadership position and NAREIT's Dividends Through Diversity, Equity and Inclusion CEO Council which addresses opportunities related to DE&I in the REIT and publicly traded real estate industry. Also, we stay on top of the best ESG practices, policies and actions within the REIT sector through active participation on NAREIT councils and initiatives. These accomplishments and areas of focus are reflections of our unwavering commitment to operating our global business in a sustainable way while guided by our core principles. We are also steadfast in driving operational efficiency throughout the business. Over the past several years, we've implemented shared service center model, executed on various cost control and process improvement initiatives and implemented site level enhancements that not only drive value to American Tower but also for our customers. An example of these initiatives is our use of drone technology to help us ensure the structural integrity of our sites. In 2021, our U.S. team demonstrated it's capabilities to scale up driving service revenue to it's highest level in over a decade supporting major carrier activity in preparation for 5G deployments. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we have made in the operating structures and processes that have been put in place are competitive advantages that will facilitate scalable expansion while converting meaningful top line growth to AFFO. At the same time, through our platform expansion initiatives, we've evaluated a range of new communications' real estate model to identify long-term growth opportunities that could complement and leverage our global tower presence, further advance our position as a market leader ahead of emerging technological trends and create attractive returns for our stakeholders. Through this process, we believe advanced wireless network technologies, in conjunction with the shift of computing power from the core to the edge, will accelerate digital transformation across many industries. We've only begun to understand the true capabilities and performance of widespread 5G coverage. And with new applications on the horizon, we think mobile edge computing will become a critical component of converged neutral host infrastructure. We believe today's 5G Edge, deployed in public or private networks with regional site hosting, will evolve to distributed tower-centric locations. We think future AI and machine learning, edge-optimized solutions supporting massive IoT devices and immersive experiences enabled with AR and VR, such as gaming, health care and education, will drive latency-sensitive edge deployments across our strategically positioned set of assets. We expect this evolution and these deployments to drive a meaningful TAM with our distributed macro tower assets ideally located to host such computing infrastructure and an integrated grid that enhances our competitive position and service offerings. Together with the CoreSite and our other data center assets, we have the scale to enable a richly interconnected hub-and-spoke edge-computing model that extends today's data center multi-cloud ecosystem out to our distributed neutral host sites, greatly enhancing our probability of success at the edge. On that note, I'd like to welcome the CoreSite team to the American Tower family. And together, I look forward to executing on our long-term development plan, while driving meaningful incremental value to our macro tower sites over time. As we move forward, we remain focused on further enhancing our investment-grade balance sheet which has been a critical element that has enabled us to grow and we expect it to remain an important component of our future success as well. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. And with the strength of our balance sheet as our foundation, we will continue to apply our Stand and Deliver strategic framework to capture value as 5G and growing mobile demand present compelling growth opportunities for American Tower. In closing, we believe that our comprehensive global portfolio, strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation strategy and continued focus on sustainability position us to extend our track record of driving solid growth and returns as we embark upon an exciting new era of digital transformation enabled by 5G. We will continue to execute on our Stand and Deliver strategy and follow the same values and discipline that have fueled our track record over the last two decades. As we continue to build and strengthen our diverse comprehensive portfolio, while enhancing our operational capabilities, we believe American Tower is well positioned to support our global customer base as we enter a hyper-connected, digitally driven world. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our 2021 results and the details of our 2022 outlook. Rod? Sure. Simon, I'll do the first and then, Rob, you can talk about Latin America. Simon, with regards to M&A, I mean, it's no different than we've been looking at things for the last two decades. We are -- because of our sheer size and our presence, we get invited into looking at just about every transaction that we see going on around the planet. And we evaluate them. We have business development teams in every one of our markets. Clearly, the focus for us right now is looking at opportunities in Europe. But it's -- as a result of the Telxius transaction and what we've done there before, we do have terrific scale in some of the critical markets in that region. And as you saw Rod just talk about, we're seeing really -- as we expected, given where the markets are from a 5G perspective, it's really outsized growth in 2022 going forward as the spectrum is deployed and as 5G gets rolled out. And as you said, there are a lot of portfolios there. And we are looking at all of them. A lot of it, we've seen it in the public realm and we've had ongoing discussions. But clearly, we're looking at it very, very carefully, looking at what would be the real opportunity there going forward, a very disciplined look in terms of valuation. So, it's really impossible at this point in time to speculate in terms of success in those. But we will clearly evaluate them and look at them and determine whether we can create long-term value as a result of those transactions. We have a very diverse portfolio which has really proven to be, I think, very valuable over the last 10 years as we've looked at the growth across the regions that we have. And Europe had been that particular market where we did not have the significant presence. And now we do and we're taking advantage of that growth. So we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities. And as I said, it's really difficult to predict what the outcomes might be but we'll continue to take a very disciplined review of those options. Sure, Ric. So the gating item is really sorting through the kind of the different options that we have ahead of us. There may be an element of common equity that we deploy here. And for modeling purposes, for outlook purposes, we are assuming that it's half of the $10 billion. Certainly, when you think about that equity offering, we did go through a tender offer. That tender offer resulted in us closing right at the end of the year and then we deal with open windows and closed windows and when, as a company, we can go out to market. And that kind of pushed us into January which was beyond Q4. And then looking at the way Q4 rolled out, we couldn't go out with equity at that point. So there's a lot of complicating factors kind of in there. But certainly, we have windows that open up here shortly and then again in Q2. But with that said, we're focused on the long-term value creation from CoreSite which is a high-quality, very interconnected network and cloud-centric set of assets that we think, over the long term, is going to drive a lot of value. So we want to make sure that we put the right financing together. And if that takes a little bit more time to get the right pieces put together, then that's what we'll do. And with that said, the common equity that we have in the assumption is an assumption. We're also out looking at private capital partnerships. We're also looking at mandatory convertible preferred instruments. And we'll make the best decisions based on market conditions, terms and conditions of any potential private capital and we'll make those decisions. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, always with the -- in the best interest of the shareholders in mind and minimizing dilution is always important to us. So we take that very seriously. And then also making sure whatever we do stay solidly within the framework of investment-grade credit. That's another thing that's very important to us. Yes. No, thanks, Ric. I mean outside of the United States, our focuses are clearly tower portfolio. We do have some initiatives going on with regards to fiber down in Latin America. We actually do have some smaller data centers, candidly down in -- down in Latin America as well on a very small scale. The reason for, clearly, the CoreSite acquisition was really in the United States, that's where we think that edge grid is really going to be developed first. And we'll look at that as clearly the market to develop that strategy and then evaluate options to be able to expand that, to the extent that it makes sense outside of the United States. So the platforms that we're really seeking outside are largely driven by the tower. We have a lot of tower and fuel initiatives going on, particularly in Africa as well as in India. So we consider that a platform extension, if you will, Ric, where we're really trying to reduce the overall carbon footprint, improve the quality of the site, reduce our overall diesel consumption similar to -- really consistent with what we're trying to do with our science-based targets but offering even more value to our customers through our more efficient power and fuel initiatives. But we will really develop the kind of that data center model, the interconnected model with our tower portfolio within the United States. And so outside of the United States, it clearly is a tower focus. Yes, Dave, I'll just take the first one. It's a quick one. I mean Steve Vondran, who is President of our U.S. business, is responsible for the CoreSite investment in the business. Juan Font who is within the business, who's a terrific leader, is actually responsible for running the CoreSite business, working directly for Steve? Rod. Matt, let me take the first one and Rod can take the second one on India. Yes, we are. We're about two months into the transaction. CoreSite had a strong finish to 2021 and we expect even a stronger set of growth metrics for in 2022. I mean there, we're moving through the integration process, as you would expect. Rod talked about the financing element of it. And we have teams looking at all of the opportunities to create synergies between the tower business as well as the data center business. But we're going to enjoy all the underlying growth that's coming from the business itself. We're integrating the data center companies that we had, albeit on a small scale, clearly compared to CoreSite into the CoreSite business. So there are a lot of activities going on from an integration perspective. On the commercial side, there are a significant amount of customer conversations, discussions, proof of concepts that are being developed and worked through on a number of different fronts with a number of different types of customers, the cloud service providers, the MNOs. And so there are continued initiatives going on to look at the opportunities to be able to bring our vision to the market. And it's not going to happen overnight. But in the meantime, we have the ability to really enjoy the underlying growth and the positioning that CoreSite has. And they have some development that's going on within their own portfolio this year in terms of building out some of the data centers that they've got. But as I said, the underlying growth trends are greater than they were in 2021. So we're really excited about the leadership team that we've got in place and the opportunities that we're going to see -- come to fruition over the next couple of years. Rod, I would just... Yes, I would just add on that one particular piece. When you think about kind of '17, '18, '19, it was kind of at the latter end of kind of the heavy 4G investments. And you would typically see that with new technologies going in place. So my sense is that that's what we would start to see when we think about 5G. We're just in the early stages. The carriers are starting to clear and roll out C-band. I mean, we'll start to see it even the end of this year when we start to get into ramp up on the organic growth rates. But as 5G takes hold and continues to develop and densifies, we would expect that similar type of growth ramp up clearly with 5G. And yes, as Rod said, Sprint was very active back at that point in time, obviously, not around any longer. But with DISH now in it's place, hopefully, they would be able to be that kind of fourth agent there and really driving that kind of growth. Sure. No, Jonathan, I mean let me start and Rod can add in. But from a European perspective, clearly, much of the growth is coming in Germany, where they've been very aggressive in terms of rolling out 5G as well as in Spain. So I mean those are our two critical markets there. But Germany is really going to be, I think, really driving a lot of it and we're seeing a lot of activity in Spain as well. From a CapEx perspective, maybe you can take a look at even our projections for 2022. I mean, it's largely driven by our tower portfolio. There are certain development activities within the data center assets in the United States building out but it pales in comparison to what we're expecting on the tower CapEx side. We're looking at a major generator rollout for a large customer in the United States which is a piece of it. And we're also looking to build another 6,000 to 7,000 sites. So if you look at over the last several years, we've built probably cumulatively about 20,000 sites and we have significant expectations for continuing that kind of a trend and '22 is no different. And so as 4G and as 5G is developed around the world, we continue to see the need for new build-to-suits and that is the best use of our capital. With regards to fiber and some of the other assets, John, I'd tell you it's de minimis. I mean it's very, very small. And in many cases, they were just science projects, where we're still trying to see if there's really an opportunity in those markets. But -- and I would see that trend candidly for the next several years, that the direction for capital is going to be driven to the tower base of assets, again, largely driven to the development side of building out new sites and very little spend on some of the fiber portfolios or fiber assets outside of the United States. And John... Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. I know there's a lot of news around the world. I hope you all stay safe and well. And again, just appreciate you all being here this morning. To the extent you have any further follow-ups, please give us a call. We are clearly by the phones waiting to talk. So, thank you all."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nIgor Khislavsky : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower 's third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We've posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www. americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will discuss current technology trends and how we're positioned to benefit from continued wireless technology evolution. And then Rob Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer, will discuss our Q3 2021 results and revised full-year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2021 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance. Our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19. And any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release.  Those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett : Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. Consistent with our prior Q3 callSteward, my comments today will center on the key trends driving our business now, and how we think the technological landscape will develop in the future. I'll touch on how we're positioned to benefit as 5G deployments accelerate in cloud-native applications in the edge of all, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, I'll spend some time discussing our European markets, where we now have a scaled presence and are poised to create further value as technology evolves there and then briefly cover what we are seeing in our earlier stage international markets. Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets and the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future.  At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations. And the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue Steward to drive our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we're excited about, and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term. Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success, and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future as macro towers should remain the most cost, and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide. Our conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time, supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless capex spending in markets like the United States, and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally. We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the 2.5 gig band currently being deployed in the U.S, as the workhorse of the true 5G experience.  And we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of these sub-6-gig frequencies compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum, to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multi-year period of strong growth on our tower sitesSteward. We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S. today, generating record services revenues, driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments.  Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless CapEx spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next five years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last five years, and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade. This compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term non-cancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027, and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that same period.  I will touch on this further in a few minutes, but as a quick reminder, these baseline growth expectations exclude any material contributions from our various platform expansion initiatives. What they do include are expectations for an extended period of solid growth in our European markets, where we are seeing similar network growth trends in the United StatesSteward with early-stage 5G deployments set to accelerate in the coming years. We expect that our newly scaled European presence will allow us to drive long-term value creation as the explosion of mobile data usage across the region continues and the need for communications infrastructure accelerates as a result.  Across Germany, Spain, and France, where 5G mobile subscriptions currently make up less than 5% of the total user base, we expect mobile data usage per smartphone to grow by more than 25% annually for the next five years, similar to the United States, and consequently expect CapEx spend across the three markets to exceed $11 billion annually over a similar time period. And as happened in the U.S. we're already seeing this acceleration in network investment translate into elevated activity. In fact, in the third quarter, normalizing for the impacts of Telxius Steward deal, co-locationSteward and amendment contributions to European organic tenant billings growth rose by around 200 basis points year-over-year.  Although we expect a significant portion of initial 5G investments to be focused in urban locations across our European footprint where Steward roughly 80% of the population resides, we anticipate urban-oriented consumer demand to be complemented by an ongoing push from European regulators to deliver rural connectivity, which will represent another opportunity for us to drive co-location on our tower sites in those areas. We believe our balance of rural and recently expanded urban assets positions us well to capture significant market share of upcoming 5G deployments over the next decade.  Finally, in our earlier stage, markets across Latin America, Asia, and Africa, we continue to see solid demand for our critical infrastructure, largely driven by deployment of legacy network technologies, particularly 4G. Whether looking at Brazil, Mexico, India, or Nigeria, consumers are rapidly increasing their utilization of smartphones, thereby driving mobile data usage growth higher. In many of these regions, existing network infrastructure is insufficient to support this deluge Stewardof usage as cell-site Steward performance is challenged with increased levels of network load. In response to these trends, we are aggressively marketing our existing assets and continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities to bolster our footprint in these markets.  But at the same time, we have significantly ramped up our new build program given the tremendous need for entirely new infrastructure. In fact, if you take the nearly 5,900 sites we built last year and add our expected 7,000 sites at the midpoint of our outlook to be constructed this year, it would represent almost as many sites as the previous 5-years combined. And as we laid out a few quarters ago, we are targeting the construction of up to 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years. With day one NOI yields on these builds continuing to average above 10%, we are excited about deploying significant capital to these initiatives going forward, as we capitalize on the advancement of network technology across the emerging world. While helping to connect billions of people. In addition, to the core secular growth trends driving our Global Tower business, we're seeing indications, particularly in more mature markets like the U.S., of a broad evolution within the overall wireless ecosystem, as Evolution is closely intertwined with 5G and includes an increased prevalence of cloud native network solutions. More emphasis on the various permutations of the network edge. And an ever-increasing intersection of the wired and wireless portions of today's converged network architecture. As networks virtualize O-RAN or Open RAN, is expected to become a more important option to improve their economics.  We are now starting to see this phenomenon with DISH in the U.S. and in Germany were 1&1 is spoken extensively about its intent to utilize this technology. By utilizing O-RAN, carriers have the potential to optimize network design and drive cost efficiencies, freeing up incremental capital to invest in densification and other network enhancements that help drive growth in site deployments in co-locations. Importantly, the role of the Tower in this evolving network design is as critical as ever. While base station functionality will likely continue to evolve to be cloud native software Agile, the radio equipment that is placed on the tower itself, which has always driven our revenue, will continue to reside on the Tower.  Importantly, we believe we can leverage our extensive global distributed real estate portfolio to not only drive continued strong growth within our core Tower business, but also to take advantage of other emerging opportunities as Networks virtualize. This may include multi-access edge computing, and potential other Edge Cloud permutations of neutral host infrastructure. At the end of the day, modern software driven networks are becoming smarter, faster, more capable, and more dynamic. And we're focused on ensuring that American Tower has a meaningful role to play in this context on the infrastructure and real estate side of the equation. One of the areas we focused on is the development of the network edge. Or more accurately, the development of multiple layers of the network edge, with the need for lower latency expected to become more and more critical over time with applications like AR, VR telemedicine, real-time analytics, autonomous driving, entertainment streaming.  You name it, and many others are beginning to merge. We continue to believe that this can be a meaningful opportunity for American Tower. As we've done more work on the evolution of the Edge, the concept of multiple edge layers has come into better focus. Today, for example, by far the most prevalent layer is the regional Metro edge owned for the most part by the large data center companies where vast amounts of data processing is in centralized. These locations provide access to cloud on-ramps and are absolutely critical within today's networks. We expect this need to be the case for the foreseeable future. In fact, if the volume of data carried across networks continues to explode, we anticipate the demand for these types of large scale facilities will only grow.  The upside of these locations is their size and capacity. The downside, which to this point hasn't been all that relevant, is the fairly significant network transit costs in latency built into reaching the central compute functions. As the data often has to travel hundreds of miles to reach these destinations. These transit costs and latency considerations, which we expect to become more important in the future, will necessitate more edge locations as up linked data increases from IOT use cases and demands for distributed computing advance. The next layer beyond the Metro edge in our view, will be the aggregation edge.  Here you're likely to host Syrian hubs in future MEK applications as network virtualization advances, along with distributed data processing, AI inferencing, and other compute functions, which will need reduced latency. The major hyper-scalars continue to evolve their edge cloud platforms, so that they can extend computing capabilities deeper into the mobile access network at the aggregation edge. The next layer beyond this, which we term the access edge, is where our existing tower sites are located today, offering an opportunity to meaningfully enhance the value of our legacy real estate.  We expect to eventually see V-RAD and O-RAN network functions, AI inferencing, Data Cashing, and a variety of other next-generation AR and VR cloud-native, ultra-low latency applications residing at these locations. Finally, we've also identified the on-premise edge, which would lie beyond even our tower sites and could eventually help support private networks, smart factories, and a host of other applications located at the end-user's site. The end of the day, our 20,000 foot view is that all of these edge elements will need to fit together to provide a cohesive framework for full scale 5G across the network ecosystem. The goal for us is to figure out what the optimal linkages between the layers look like.  Who the key players will be. And what elements of the edge we may want to own in order to further enhance the strong long-term growth we expect from our core existing business. To date, as we seek to connect the dots, we've been active with a number of trial edge compute sites at the access edge, while also operating our COLO-ATL Metro Data Center interconnection facility in Atlanta. Through these investments, we have built relationships with key existing and potential future customers. I've learned a tremendous amount about key demand trends, and I've had a front row seat for the beginning stages of the convergence of wireless and wireline networks that I alluded to earlier.  More recently, we acquired DataSite, a data center Company consisting of two multi-tenant data centers in the Atlanta area and in Orlando. In addition to strengthening our existing position in Atlanta, the addition of a network dense carrier hotel facility in Orlando, provides us with a strong Southeastern presence, with a profile and characteristics that we believe will be critical in the early evolution of the Metro edge, as we evaluate its role in the mobile networks of the future. We expect these facilities, which have 18 megawatts of combined power and additional 4.5 megawatts of expansion capacity, to effectively complement COLO-ATL and enable us to enhance our ability to develop neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud data centers to support the broader Quarta Edge connectivity evolution in the U.S..  We continue to believe that while a scaled, application, driven edge oriented business model, is still likely several years away, it has the potential to be a sizable market opportunity with meaningful potential upside. Not only in the U.S., but also on a global basis. Leading global M&O's are now positioning their networks with Release 16, 5G stand-alone core features to explore Edge Cloud opportunities. And with our distributed macro side presence, key markets around the world, we think we're well-positioned to potentially be a provider of choice on the edge, particularly for large multinational M&O's, and other categories of customers who maybe looking for a multi-market solution.  Switching gears a bit, while we believe edge compute will eventually also be relevant in emerging markets, it is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Consequently, we have focused our platform expansion efforts across our developing regions in other areas, most notably on increasing the sustainability and efficiency of power provisioning in our sites. As we highlighted in our recently published 2020 corporate sustainability report. We've continued to make progress toward our goal of reducing diesel-related greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2027, from a 2017 baseline. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019 reaching 53% of the 10-year of goal.  We're continuing to make solid progress in 2021 with an expectation to spend an additional $80 million or its energy efficient solutions primarily in lithium, Ion, and solar power across our Africa footprint, which will bring our cumulative spend to nearly $250 million. And as we announced earlier this week, we are furthering our commitment to combat climate change by adopting science-based targets, which we expect to help inform our future investments and sustainability. In addition to the positive environmental benefits from these investments, we are also delivering shareholder value through AFFO per share accretion. Lithium-ion batteries provide significant energy efficiency, density, and lifespan improvements over legacy solutions.  And while to-date, AFFO benefits to American Tower have largely come through fuel savings, we anticipate over time that our yields on these investments will further expand as we are able to lengthen battery and generator replacement cycles. Having already expanded our lithium-ion powered site count from 4500 in 2019 to 6700 in 2020, we are targeting another 8,000 sites by the end of 2022. And recently signed a multi-million dollar bulk battery purchase agreement in Africa in support of this goal. Importantly, we believe that energy efficiency, the use of renewables and sustainability in our broader sense, can represent an important competitive advantage for us.  Not only from the flow through to AFFO, but also the differentiation and service quality for our customers. We continue to view sustainability as a critical component of our Company culture and will be highlighting our continued progress in future sustainability reports, which I encourage all of you to read by the way. In closing, our excitement around 5G on a global basis continues to grow. Consumers and enterprises are using more advanced devices for more things, resulting in consistent elevated growth in mobile data usage, which in turn strains existing wireless networks and necessitates incremental densification and network improvement. Considerable new spectrum is being deployed, new entrants and select markets are building Greenfield networks.  And our macro Tower oriented portfolio remains well-positioned to capture a significant portion of wireless investment activity. In addition, through our platform expansion strategy, we are focused on ensuring that the Company benefits from the ongoing convergence of wireless and wireline and the associated expansion of virtualization in cloud native applications throughout the network ecosystem. Importantly, as we optimize our core business, and look for ways to further enhance our growth path in the broader digital infrastructure world. We are as committed as ever to driving profitability, sustainability, and recurring growth. We're energized by the future and are excited to be in a vibrant industry that is helping to connect the world. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full-year 2021 outlook. Rod.\nRod Smith : Thanks, Tom and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. I hope you and your families are well. Q3 was another quarter of strong performance for us. And as you heard from Tom, we are as encouraged as ever by the technological trends that underpin our long-term growth potential. Before digging into the details of our results and raised outlook, I'd like to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we closed on our strategic partnership agreements with CDPQ and Allianz, through which they purchased an aggregate of 48% of our ATC Europe business for total consideration of around EUR 2.6 billion. In addition, we closed the remaining 4,000 Telsey's communication sites in Germany back in August. With the transaction now fully closed and funded, our teams are working to rapidly integrate the assets and we're already seeing encouraging activity on the portfolio.  Second, we continued to strengthen our Balance Sheet, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes, including our euro offering earlier this month. Through our financing transactions, we've been able to maintain an attractive weighted average cost of debt while also continuing to extend our maturities. As a result of this activity, along with the benefit from a non-recurring advanced payment received from a tenant during the quarter, we finished Q3 with net leverage of 4.9 times. While we expect net leverage to increase back into the low 5 times range in the fourth quarter, we are right on track with our overall post healthiest delevering path. And lastly, we saw another quarter of record services activity in the U.S. as carriers accelerated 5G related projects. We view this as a leading indicator of strong levels of gross leasing in our property segment as we head into 2022 and beyond. And with that, please turn to slide six and I'll review our Q3 property revenue in organic tenant billings, growth. As you can see, our consolidated property revenue grew by over 19% year-over-year or over 18% on an FX -neutral basis to nearly $2.4 billion. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of around 10% and international property revenue growth of over 31% or 13% when excluding the impacts of the Telxius acquisition. This strong performance is indicative of a continuation of the long-term secular trends driving demand for our infrastructure, assets across the globe. Moving to the right side of the slide, we also had a solid quarter of organic tenant billings growth throughout the business.  On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was nearly 5% for a second consecutive quarter. As expected, U.S. 5G investments from the major carriers drove healthy activity levels, leading to organic tenant billings growth in our U.S. and Canada segment of over 4%. Contributions from co-location and amendments were more than 3%, escalators came in at 3.2%, and churn was just over 2%. Moving to our international operations, we drove organic tenant billings growth of nearly 6%, reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 60 basis points. Africa was our fastest-growing region in the quarter, posting organic tenant billings growth of well over 9%, led by Nigeria, where we continue to see 4G investment driving both co-location activity and new site construction.  We also saw a consistent quarter in Latin America, where organic tenant billings growth was right around 7%, driven by solid new business and higher escalators, primarily in Brazil. Meanwhile, European organic tenant billings growth accelerated by around 100 basis points sequentially to nearly 5.5% as expected. Excluding impacts from the Telxius acquisition, organic tenant billings growth in the region would've been over 4.5% in the quarter, more than 200 basis points higher than the year-ago period, driven primarily by new business contributions. This positive trend reflects both ongoing 4G activity and early 5G investments, leading to solid growth from both co-locations and amendments.  Looking to Germany, in particular, we saw a more than 300 basis point increase in co-location and amendment contributions in our legacy business as compared to the prior year period, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of over 5.5% up from 5.2% in the second quarter. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we saw organic tenant billings growth of 0.7% up roughly 200 basis points as compared to Q2. This reflects a modest acceleration in gross new business activity coupled with a more than 2% sequential decline in churn, which was in line with our expectations.  Turning to Slide 7, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew more than 19% or over 18% on an FX neutral basis to nearly $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.2%, which was down compared to Q3 2020. As a result of adding new lower initial tenancy assets to our portfolio, which we believe will drive strong organic growth and therefore margin expansion in the future. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.3%, a roughly 40 basis points sequential improvement. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was over 13%, with consolidated AFFO per share of $2.53, reflecting a per-share growth of nearly 11%.  This was driven by strong performance in our core business, contributions from new assets and around $13 million in year-over-year FX favorability. Our performance also reflected the benefits of our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our operations and minimizing financing costs, despite growing the portfolio by nearly 38,000 sites over the last year. And finally, AFFO per share attributable to AMT common stockholders, was $2.49, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 12%. Let's now turn to our updated outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, our expectations for organic growth across the business are consistent with our prior outlook.  Carriers continued to deploy meaningful capital as they invest in network quality. And we're seeing numerous bands of spectrum being deployed for both 4G and 5G. We are also slightly increasing our expectations for services revenue for the year to around $235 million as a result of an out-sized third quarter. Although this implies that services volumes will moderate somewhat in Q4. Second, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency and cost controls, along with some one-time benefits, we expect to be able to take some costs out of the business as compared to our prior expectations.  Combined with current services gross marginal performance, this will drive our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations higher for the balance of the year. Third, in India, we are encouraged by recent regulatory reforms, which we believe can provide some much needed breathing room for capital constraint carriers in the marketplace and improve the telecom environment overall. While we believe this is a clear positive first step towards market recovery, we continue to expect flat 2021 organic tenant billings growth in the region as we further evaluate the long-term impacts of these developments on the sector. Finally, incorporating the latest FX projections, our current outlook reflects negative FX impacts of $30 million for property revenue, $20 million for adjusted EBITDA, and $15 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations. With that, let's move to the details of our revised full-year outlook.  Looking at Slide 8, as expected, leasing trends remain strong across our global business. And as a result of an increase in pass-through together with some modest core property revenue out-performance, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $10 million. This represents 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and includes $30 million in unfavorable trans - lational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Moving to slide 9, you'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth expectations of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. This includes roughly 3% growth in our U.S. and Canada segment where 5G deployments are driving solid activity levels as we exit the year.  As a reminder, we expect the 1st and largest tranche of contractual sprint churn to hit our run rate in the fourth quarter of this year. And while we expect gross activity to remain solid, our guide implies a Q4 U.S organic tenant billings growth rate of -1% as we communicated previously. On the international side, we continue to anticipate organic tenant billings growth in the range of 5% to 6% as carriers continue to focus their efforts on enhancing indensifying wireless networks in the face of ever-rising mobile data demand. Moving to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $50 million and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 16%.  This increase reflects continued strength in our services segment, where we now expect to see roughly $145 million in services gross margin for the year up from the $123 million implied in our prior guidance with year-over-year growth of more than 180%. On the cost side of the equation, we continue to maintain cost discipline globally, helping to drive adjusted EBITDA margins up by around 40 basis points for the full year as compared to prior expectations. Turning to slide 11, we are also raising our full-year AFFO expectations, and now expect year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of roughly 15%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.64 per share.  The flow-through of incremental cash adjusted EBITDA, coupled with the continued cash tax and net cash interest benefits as compared to the prior expectations, are being partially offset by around $15 million in negative translational FX impacts. on a per-share basis, we now expect growth of approximately 14% for the year consistent with our long-term growth ambitions that we highlighted at the start of the year. Finally, AFFO, attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 12% versus 2020, incorporating the minority interest impacts of our strategic partnership with CDPQ and Allianz in Europe.  Moving onto slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2021. As you can see, we remain focused on deploying capital towards assets that drive strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share, coupled with a growing dividend providing our investors with a compelling combination of growth plus yields. Working our way through the specific categories. Our first priority remains our dividend. For the full year, we continue to expect to distribute $2.3 billion subject to board approval, which implies a roughly 15% year-over-year per-share growth rate. As a reminder, our dividend growth will continue to be driven by underlying growth in our re-taxable income, incorporating the impacts of MLA, and other moving pieces in the business.  Consistent with our prior comments, we anticipate growing our dividend by at least 10% annually in the coming years. Moving on to CapEx, we reiterate our expectations of spending nearly $1.6 billion at the midpoint with nearly 90% being discretionary in nature. Driving a good portion of this discretionary CapEx is our continued expectation to construct 7,000 sites at the midpoint this year, with the vast majority in our international markets. Turning to acquisitions, including contributions from minority partners, we have deployed around $10 billion so far this year, primarily for the Telxius transaction.  As well as for smaller transactions including data site. In total of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployments for the year, we expect over 80% to be composed of discretionary growth CapEx and MLA. Moving to the center of the slide, you can see the composition of our $35 billion in cumulative capital deployments since the start of 2017, including our 2021 full-year expectations. We continue to augment our developed market presence, which we believe positions us optimally to drive value from accelerating 5G deployments and next-generation technology evolutions as Tom laid out earlier.  We are also allocating capital towards higher growth, earlier stage markets that are typically at least 5 years behind the U.S. and Europe in their network deployments. Taken together, we believe that our global footprint positions us to capture multiple waves of investments across the globe over a sustained period of time. Finally, you can see that more than a quarter or around $9.5 billion of our deployed capital in the last 5 years has been distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  We continue to view these components as critical to total shareholder returns. Moving to the right side of the chart, supporting this phase of significant investment and growth has been our investment-grade Balance Sheet. We believe that our access to low-cost diversified sources of financing has been a key differentiator and are proactively working to extend this critical competitive advantage into the future. In fact, incorporating our latest financing efforts, we now have a weighted average cost of debt of around 2.4%. A weighted average tenor of debt of approximately seven years, and over 85% of our Balance Sheet locked into fixed rate instruments.  Finally, on Slide 13, and in summary, in Q3, we continue to capitalize on a strong global demand backdrop, delivering our highest quarter of consolidated AFFO per share on record. This was driven by solid organic growth, record-setting services volumes, disciplined cost controls, strategic balance sheet management, and a creative portfolio expansion. As we look ahead, we believe our existing global real estate portfolio is well positioned to drive long-term recurring growth as carriers augment and extend their networks.  And with the strength of our investment-grade Balance Sheet and diversified pool of funding sources, we expect to continue to deploy capital towards creative investments that can enhance our growth path, and enable us to create additional value. Given our positioning at the intersection of real estate and technology, in an ever more interconnected world, we are excited to continue to deliver connectivity to billions of people worldwide in a sustainable way, while driving compelling total returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Michael Rollins with Citi, please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. TwoSteward questions if I could. The first question is on the domestic environment. Just curious if you can give us an update on U.S leasing, how it compared to your prior expectations entering into this year? And what that means for the average of organic tenant billings growth guidance that you provided? I think the average for '21 and '22 was about 2% on a reported basis and about 5% on a normalized basis. And then just, Tom to follow up on your comments on the edge in data centers, is it inevitable that American Tower needs to either partner with a larger data center portfolio or directly ownSteward a larger data center portfolio? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett : Thanks, Michael. Maybe, Rod, why don't you take the first part of the question.\nRod Smith : Yeah.\nTom Bartlett : And then I'll fill in on the second piece.\nRod Smith : Okay. Great. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. In terms of the U.S. leasing environment, we're seeing a very strong environment. Certainly all the major carriers have been active. You've seen that show up most notably in our services environment. We've seen a tick up in the contribution from colocation and amendment activity into our organic tenant billings growth, so that's been accelerating through each of the last 3 quarters, just as we expected from the outset in the year. So, in terms of our expectations, everything really is right in line with what we expected. I don't want to get too deep into the second part of your question around growth and activity when it comes to 2022, but I will just reiterate a couple of points that we've already made, so directionally your comments are correct.  We guided to an average organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. for '21 and '22 of around 2%. So, you can see we are coming in here in '21 at around 3%. That suggests around 1% organic tenant billings growth for 2022 in the U.S., so that's where we would expect to be. And again, I'm not providing guidance for next year, just reiterating the components of our long-term plan. And maybe one thing that I will highlight here just briefly is that Sprint churn hit us in Q4 for the first time, that first tranche, as you heard in my comments, so Sprint churn, now that it's active, I will just give you the numbers there again, 2021 we are rolling off 195 million of annual Sprint revenue in churn, in 2022, we'll roll off an additional 60, 2023 we'll roll off another 50 million, in 2024 we'll roll-off another 70 million. So that's Sprint churn, and that's what's really causing the lower organic growth rate within our U.S. business. Next year, the gross growth, we see the environment being very strong, accelerating through 2021, and we expect that to continue going in. Just to give you a couple of the piece parts in terms of the impact it will have on the fourth quarter, you will see organic tenant billings growth rates in the U.S. around a negative 1%, and that will include churn for the quarter of about 6.6%, and embedded within that is about 4.5% just from the Sprint churn.  And of course, all of this will have an impact on AFFO in terms of going forward into future years. So, we've guided that our goal is to hit double-digit AFFO growth on average from 2021 through 2027. And of course, some years it will be higher, some years it will be lower. The goal really is an average. And when you think about 2022 and this first tranche of Sprint churn kind of rolling through, that's a year that I would say that would be challenging to get to 10%. I'll also say, Michael, we haven't given up on it. There are certain levers that we can pull and things that we can do with the business to maximize AFFO and AFFO per share growth. And we're doing all of those -- all of those things. So that kind of puts a little bit of context around the U.S. activity for this year and rolling into next year.\nTom Bartlett : And Michael, relative to your second question, you can tell that we're obviously energized and excited about the opportunity at the edge. I mean the impetus right now is really 5G and driving all of these lower latency types of applications and needs out further into the market closer and closer to the end user. We've always said from a digital transformation perspective, it's going to be cloud-based, it's going to be connected, and it's going to be distributed. And we think we're in a very good competitive position given the vast amount of distribution that we have in the 25 markets that we\u2019re Steward servicing.  So we're trying to position ourselves inSteward this broader market to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. We're going to do it intelligently. Our execution strategy continues to evolve. We think we've done it intelligently in terms of picking up some of the Metro sites, building out our own sites. We have some market agreements in place to drive access into those sites, and this is going to evolve. This is not going to happen overnight as you well know. And so, we've got partnerships in place to be able to look at this. We're going to be able to hopefully leverage Steward some of those partnerships, and we'll just continue to monitor the best approach in terms of being able to best position ourselves, to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.  We've done that in the past in terms of being smart in terms of how we allocate capital to these types of investments. Will it take the form of partnerships owning -- further owning more metro sites, unclear at this point in time. That will continue to evolve as the market continues to evolve, but we do think we're in a really good position in terms of being able to leverage our real estate -- our exclusive real estate and to be able to take advantage of that neutral host model.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nTom Bartlett : You bet.\nOperator: Next we move on to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Operator Instructions]\nSimon Flannery : Thank you. Good morning. First, Rod, I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the advanced payment looks like close to a billion dollars. What's going on there? Is that something that we will see again? And then there's been a lot of talk about supply chain. We're seeing higher inflation, particularly in markets like Brazil. Are you seeing any pressure on your customers in terms of their ability to source radios, to source Tower crews, and the cost of that, that might impact some of the installs and do your MLA's protect you from any delayed installs, any color around that would be great.\nRod Smith : Great. Thanks for the question and good morning. And thanks for being on this call. So with advanced prepayment, I'm not going to provide details around that. I will say it was a little over $1 billion from one of our customers. It really is just a prepayment for lease payments going out over, let's say the next 12 months, so it will kind of run through our financial statements pretty quickly. And there's nothing more to it than just a prepayment of the next 12 months, kind of leasing fees. So from our perspective is it's not a big deal that helps with liquidity, brought our leverage down a little bit. You thought we ended a little bit below five times in terms of leverage. So it wasn't a bad thing for us to do, but it's a pretty simple transaction and I wouldn't want you to read any more into it than that.  In terms of supply chain, Tom may want to add a few comments here, but from a supply chain, we see no major impacts at this point, certainly across our business. As you can see in our services business, we continue to hit higher and higher levels of activity and bringing our outlook up again for another consecutive quarter here. We've got access to the cruise. You've also seen our margins expanding in the services business in particular, and in the U.S. we're not building a tremendous amount of Tower, so we certainly don't have any restrictions or challenges from that perspective.  One place I would say going into 2022, we will be keeping our eye on crew availability and labor and things like that. If the environment stays the way it is, we should be fine if things get worse, we'll need to keep our eye on it. We do buy a lot of generators. We have generated orders out that are already in place. That brings us out into the beginning to the middle of 2022. So from that perspective, we know we're going to get some materials we need or we expect to get the materials we need and feel pretty good about that.  But in the second half of 2022, again, we'll continue to watch the supply chain issues. And to the extent that there are any issues that get worse, we'll continue. to keep an eye on it and kind of pull the levers, but from where we sit now, we don't think we'll -- we don't see anything hitting us right now. We don't expect any challenges through the middle of 2022, and beyond that, it's too early to comment. We'll just keep our eye on it.\nSimon Flannery : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. One on India, I guess there's some better organic growth this quarter return to positive growth, I think for the first time since 2Q '20. So can you maybe talk a little bit more about the overall demand backdrop across your carrier customers and whether -- I guess maybe to drill in a little bit more, churn was about a couple million lower than what we've seen in terms of recent run rate. And so I'm wondering if the $14 million we saw this quarter is maybe a better run rate to now think about and start modeling going forward. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett : Yes, thanks for the question and good morning. So we did see organic tenant billings in Asia kind of turned a corner here and gets a positive. So we posted a 0.7% positive growth rate. We're still looking for the full year to be right around 0. And as we look at the market, we remain optimistic in terms of the gross activity. So the way that even that 0.7 organic tenant billings for the quarter, I will give you a little bit of the breakdown there. So we're seeing high single-digits, nearly double-digit organic new business that's been pretty consistent for at least 6 to 8 consecutive quarters. And based on where they are in their development kind of transitioning from 3G to 4G networks. We expect that that gross demand should continue, the escalators are locked in right around 2 to 2.2% or so we have that to count on.  We have seen a moderation and a pretty sharp decline here year-over-year in terms of the churn rate. So a year ago, Q3 churn in India was about 13.5%, it's down now about 7.5%. We think that's certainly a very favorable sign and one that we expected to see, and we hope to continue to see that going forward. In terms of the -- we did see that there was some good news from the government in terms of regulatory support for the industry. And we think that that will help the market in general, the whole sector as well as the carriers, particularly the ones with the AGR dues.  But all the carriers, even with just spectrum fees, strengthen their own Balance Sheet, kind of regroup and gear up for competition in this sector there and to invest in their networks. So we are optimistic about going forward growth rates there, but we would expect, let's call it high single-digit organic growth with churn levels there, in the mid-single-digits and hopefully moderating down over time.\nMatt Niknam : Rod, can I just follow-up, 1 other question I wanted to sneak in is on capital improvement CapEx. It's been trending lower, I think year-to-date. You've already done around 100 million, but I think the guide is for about a 185 million for the year. I'm just wondering what's been driving the lower capital improving CapEx year-to-date and then was it was it fair to assume then a much larger step-up that could weigh on AFFO in 4Q? Thanks.\nRod Smith : Yeah, so the cap maintenance there is going to pop up in Q4. I think you see that you just mentioned in terms of our guide. It really is just timing, and it's a timing issue that we've seen in prior years. So if you look back at our last year, spread and maintenance CapEx, you'll see kind of the same sort of cycle. It is a Cash CapEx number, so it does lag a little bit in terms of the activity. So you see this kind of spike in leasing activity that's going -- that's running through our services revenue. And then you kind of see following on from that, you'll see an uptick in the maintenance CapEx that we run through to support the towers and maintain everything out of the tower sites. So it really is just a timing issue, Matt.\nMatt Niknam : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And next we have a question from Eric Lukow with Wells Fargo Please go ahead.\nEric Lukow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Perhaps you could talk about Verizon real quickly. I think your holistic pricing structure with them expires at the end of this year. So wondering if you could update us on the nature of conversations with them around that aspect of the MLA. And then secondly, on the European side, is nice to see the improvement in organic tenant billings growth. Could you just talk about how the outperformance is coming from, whether that's churn from Telefonica versus new bookings, and then on the new bookings front? Any update on conversations with one-by-one as they contemplate the new build and how you think your position there. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett : Yes, thanks for the question. I'll take the first part there and so from when you look at our business over in Europe, we are very pleased with the trajectory of the growth rates over they you've seen a couple of sequential quarters of increased organic growth rates, just as we expected to see now that the market has seen a reduction in churn, they're gearing up for 5G deployments, so that's been really good to see. In terms of the piece parts of the organic tenant billings, certainly the Telefonica, additional sites plays a role in there. One of the biggest ways that it plays in early on, it's still very early in terms of bringing those assets in, but I think we've talked before about the assets there in Europe that they basically have a long-term contract and there on other tenant material, other tenants on there.  So there's really very little churn that will -- that's possible on that portfolio. So we have very low turn expectations on that portfolio and it's a big chunk of revenue, that certainly helps inflect the growth rates to go up higher. And then in terms of the question with drilage one-on-one, we really don't want to comment on ongoing negotiations, but negotiations continue there I can assure you.\nOperator: And we will move on to the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden : Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. First, Rod, just to follow-up on the Europe situation at our conference last month, you kind of talked a little bit about how you perceive the European marketplace being right for incremental consolidation. I was wondering if you or Tom could elaborate a little bit on how you see the European market evolving as it matures from a Tower third-party infrastructure provider perspective. And then second, if you could elaborate a little bit on what is going on now with Telefonica in Mexico, and its network sharing agreement with AT&T and how that relationship between the two of them is evolving for them.\nTom Bartlett : Hey David, if Tom, I can start and Rod can add in. With regards to Europe, we think we have a really solid position in them. And a few of the critical markets, we've got good scale in the markets we've got a great relationship, obviously with Telefonic and O-RAN in particular, and so we're, energized by the type of growth that we are now seeing in the marketplace. But we continue to look at opportunities to further build scale, not just in the 3 markets that we're in, but also if there are other opportunities, but only if it makes sense, like everything else that we do. And so there are, I think, a lot of opportunities in the region, and we're evaluating them as you would expect. And to the extent that there's some opportunities there to secure some of that portfolio to gain further scale even in the markets that we're in.  And relationships with key customers, we'll clearly look to do that. And so Europe is -- as we've said, an area or part of the world that we look to continue to further develop if it makes sense. With regards to Telefonica, again, we've got a great global relationship with them. They are positioning to an MVNO as you all know, and they're going to have some time for that to be able to -- for that to occur. There will be some churn over time, but the contract that we have with them, I think goes out for several years at this point in time. And so we'll continue to monitor that and we've managed these types of events. I think quite well over -- over our history. And I'm sure we will do that here.\nDavid Barden : Thanks, Tom.\nTom Bartlett : Sure, Dave.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss : Good morning.\nTom Bartlett: Hi, Ric.\nRic Prentiss : Hey. Couple questions, you guys. First, appreciate you guys breaking out the attributable AFFO I think that is important to focus investors on cash to comment, and you continue to exclude non-cash amortization on your organic ratio, so I appreciate that, accounting stuff. First question, we get a lot on interest rates and inflation. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys are viewing the interest rate environment and inflation environment? How it affects your financials, any potential deals like David was just asking about, and just the fundamentals of the business? So little bit primmer on interest rates and inflation as you see it.\nRod Smith: Yeah. Sure, Ric. I'll -- good morning. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So let's say the interest rates are -- so you've seen us, Ric, over the last several quarters, even the last couple of years, very active in the capital markets, very active in terms of our debt structure, capital structure, and in different things like that. We've been focused on strengthening our balance sheet in a very proactive way. We now have our average maturities out over about 7 years with an average cost of debt down to about 2.4% or so. And 85% of our debt is now fixed out over the long term. So that's a heavier weighting towards fixed to variable compared to our kind of standard financial policy.  So we've been preparing for an environment where interest rates may tick up so we think from an interest rate perspective, our Balance Sheet is very solid and ready for it. There's nothing we can do about preventing interest rates from rising. We do think they may rise over time modestly, but we're very well prepared for it. The other thing I would add is in terms of global capital allocation, and looking to invest capital, the strength of our Balance Sheet really does represent a competitive advantage for us, particularly in a time when interest rates may be rising. So we'll keep an eye on that and look to be very opportunistic as we go forward from that perspective.  And then when you think about inflation rates, one of the ways you will see that run through our businesses is many of our contracts internationally, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are all geared towards inflation rates and the escalator is adjusted based on inflation rate. So as and when we see higher levels of inflation in the international markets, we'll see higher levels of growth as well in the U.S. And remind you that our escalators are fixed at around 3%. That's been consistent for a long time. So we're pretty well insulated from interest rates rising in the U.S. from a balance sheet perspective, but we still lock in that revenue growth of 3% on the U.S. escalator.\nRic Prentiss : I think in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about acquisition opportunities, even outside of Europe. David was asking about Europe. As you think about how you view the potential opportunities in Africa, Latin America or other markets as far as portfolio is coming up, and what makes for attractive intelligent decisions as you kind of alluded to?\nTom Bartlett : Ric, it comes back to the same model that we've been executing for the last decade. It's looking to build up scale, looking at the counter party, looking at the market itself, and then looking at the transaction itself, what additional capital has got to go into the portfolio to be able to ensure it, so we can support a second or third 10, and what is the growth profile look like. They're probably a dozen different elements of that evaluation that go into deciding whether in fact we would be interested, and then driving what that price is.  We've used the same 10-year discounted cash flow approach and continue to use it. Obviously, the variables change but largely -- I meant the actual numbers, but largely the variables themselves from a qualification perspective are the same. And so we'll look at those and look at all of those opportunities, we think about globally how to allocate capital.\nRic Prentiss: Is there any change in the pipeline as far as deals going on and what might be changing that pipeline as far as potential deals?\nTom Bartlett : You talked about the pipeline of transactions?\nRic Prentiss : Yes.\nTom Bartlett : Yes. I mean, it's been very consistent. I mean, the pipeline itself there are -- there's more activity as you've seen, and as you report on in Western Europe. And, but in terms of the pipeline, in terms of the opportunities, they remain relatively consistent. Overall, if you look at our total portfolio, the last count I did we owned about a third of the inventory and all of the markets. And so there's still a lot of opportunity in the markets that we're in. Given how carriers, our existing customers, carriers are looking at continually looking at trying to monetize their portfolio. Smaller tower co's are looking for opportunities to exit. There was private capital involved in some of those smaller tower co's.  And so, they're looking to monetize some of their funds. Some increased opportunity in Southeast Asia that's going on as we speak, as you've well seen. But it's been -- the pipeline has been very consistent. I would say where it's a little bit out sized is probably the all of the noise is going on in Western Europe. And there just seems to be a lot of activity going on there as you've seen, as we've seen in the -- all of the public comments. And so it's probably a bit of an out-sized pipeline in that region, but other than that, it's been very consistent.\nRic Prentiss: [Indiscernible] never dull [Indiscernible]\nTom Bartlett : Great.\nRod Smith : Hey, Ric, you mentioned attributable. Maybe I'll just give you a couple of data points there because we have -- you've seen over the last quarter or so, we've had a few moving pieces with closing the Telxius transaction in numerous tranches. We also brought in private capital. It may be a good time to just level set that. So for the full year, we're looking -- you can see in our presentation, in terms of AFFO attributable to our minority, shareholders is about 100 million, and that breaks down 75 million roughly for the European business and about 25 million for the India business. The way our partners breakdown is, you know CDPQ owns 30% of our European business and Aliansce owns about 18% of that business.  PGGM holds about 17% in Germany, and about 13% in Spain. We have Macquarie as a partner over in India, they own about 8%. Now is a good time to kind of think about the run rate aspect of that minority interest. When you look at Q4, now that all the dust has settled, we think the run rate -- a good ballpark run rate is about 40 million for Q4. So if you annualize that, you get a range of 150 to 160, that would be attributable to the minority interest partners. The one word, actually I would say is, we will -- we did receive the put from a core where you've seen that in our filings. So we will eventually close on that and that'll be an adjustment to the numbers at that -- at that time.\nRic Prentiss : That really helps. Thanks, Rod. I really think it's important to focus on that. Thank you.\nOperator: And next we will go to the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about Latin America. I'm hearing an echo here. The churn has ticked up in recent quarters, and I imagine some of that might be Telefonica. But I wonder if you can provide some color on what's driving that?\nTom Bartlett: Yeah, Jonathan. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I don't want to go through the churn carrier-by-carrier. But I think you do know that there are a few customers in Latin America that are exiting the businesses or that have been consolidated. So we do have the next exit down in the Brazil area. We do have Telefonica transitioning to the MVNO in that -- in the Mexico market and moving onto the AT&T site. Some of that churns began. You've seen a bump up in our non-run rate activity in Latin America for some decommissioning in Brazil that is related to the next cell sites coming down that will continue into next year.  So you'll see a bump up in churn, and then you will also see a bump up in that non-run rate as well. And then there are -- you will see some benefits to some of the churn that come through a settlement payment. And there are a few other smaller customers, but that probably gives you a flavor of who's there, and what's happening in Latin America from a churn perspective.\nJon Atkin: And then on Nigeria, I just was hoping that you could give us a little bit about qualitative view as to the tailwinds and headwinds to expect as it pertains to organic growth, you obviously have a little bit of a different portfolio than IHS given how you entered the market. But how do you think about -- what are the factors to keep in mind around organic growth in Nigeria going forward?\nTom Bartlett : I think in Nigeria, we've seen very strong growth for the last several quarters here. We expect that to continue. We've got a great portfolio in Nigeria was a solid anchor tenant with MTN in there as a partner of ours. So that's been really good. I would say that as long as the economy, and the economy in Nigeria is largely driven by fuel prices, as long as that's good, I think we're in really good shape because we've got a great portfolio in the country. and the carriers will continue to invest capital and build out sites. We've got a pretty robust build program there, so you've seen the guide with 7,000 thousand sites that we expect to build as a good chunk of those in Africa. And in Africa, a lot of them they're in Nigeria.  So I would say that we are very bullish on Nigeria in terms of the growth rates we're seeing high single-digit, if not double-digit, organic growth rates in Nigeria. As long as the economy there continues to roll forward I think we're in really good shape and that's largely, I believe, based on fuel pricing.\nJon Atkin : Lastly, I think you were asked about realizing the holistic MLA and I wondered if you had any kind of response to that.\nTom Bartlett: Hey, John. It's consistent with what we've said in the past. We've got I think a terrific relationship with Verizon. I can't comment on anything specifically relative to negotiations or those types of things. But we want to be able to service our customers and be strategic to them, as makes sense for them. And so we'll look to continue dialog if they're looking for more of our card type of pricing we'll go in that direction. If they're looking for renewal for realistic will go in that direction. More to come, but they're very active in the marketplace. They're very aggressive in terms of building out their network, and I think we've seen it. They talked about it. And they are doing a terrific job, and we're here to support them however best we can.\nJon Atkin : Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Nick Del Deo with Moffett Nathanson, please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. One on Telxius and then one on domestic spectrum deployment. So first, how long does it take you to typically get acquired, carrier-owned sites or I guess in the case of Telxius quasi carrier-owned sites, kind of plugged into your systems and effectively marketed so that you really see the lease improvements from being independently-owned flow-through. And will it happen faster than normal for Telxius since again, they were kind of quasi-independent before you pick them up? And then second in the U.S., we often times talked about urban markets seen activity first, with spectrum deployments, especially for like the upper mid-band spectrum that the carriers at a point today enforce. Are you seeing that play out in practice, across your portfolio or is it more even than we might suspect?\nTom Bartlett : On Telxius I can tell you day one, we were marketing those sites.\nTom Bartlett : Okay. So we're as aggressively as we possibly can in terms of providing those sites out to our customers. The integration has gone really well. And it takes time from a system perspective and getting that organized, getting them into systems and integrating systems and things like that, that can I can take 6 months to a year. but that doesn't prevent us from marketing those sides to our customers and making them available to all of our customers will be aggressive from a capital perspective, to the extent that there are some sites that we need to attend to, from a structural perspective, to be able to support them. But I've said all along, and this was a really terrifically built portfolio, and that was one of the attractions to the portfolio to begin with.  So we're being as aggressively as we can to really be able to take advantage of these sites, particularly markets like Germany and Spain, where 5G is really picking up. From a U.S. perspective, you're right. If you go back to even old analog days, the markets were generally built up from your urban markets, because that's where you're able to get the best bang for the buck when you're rolling out capital. This one though, I would say, with 5G is broader. It is a goal to get nationwide coverage for all the customers.  And then to continue to fill it in as demand and as capacity requirements are required. What's not a surprise to us, and I reiterated in my comments, the macro towers is the main asset that our customers are deploying 5G on. And I never had any doubts of that, simply because I've been involved in the industry for 30 years. So the macro tower is just the best way for our customers to get that signal out to their customers. And so we're seeing that, but we are seeing it more across the entire country. Again, as customers are really trying to be able to get to that nationwide coverage.\nNick Del Deo : Got it. Thanks, Tom.\nTom Bartlett: You bet.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. That's tom -- excuse me. Tim Horan with Oppenheimer, please go ahead.\nTim Horan: Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and one question. Do companies pay when they install the equipment? Or with MLA, do you have to pay regardless of whether or not being installed equipment one? Secondly, come on -- you've been able to kind of raise prices in the U.S. about double the inflation rate, historically now, right now it's almost half the inflation rate. Do you think over time you would have the ability to kind of increase prices faster than inflation? And then lastly, I know you mentioned a lot of new technologies out there, are any of that you think are a risk to the business model that you're concerned about at watching. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Sure, Tim. Go ahead, Rod, you take that first.\nRod Smith : Yeah, I'll get the first one, Tom, around the payment cycle and equipment installation. Tim, I would say that it really works in a variety of ways depending on which contracts you're talking about and how it's structured. Certainly on a pay by the drink type of in all our contract, carriers would pay us lease by lease as and when they install the equipment, or probably better, more precisely said, when the contract gets executed and the commencement date is triggered, and that's typically when the building permit is pulled and construction starts or certainly by the time that the equipment is installed, if you looking at more of a holistic transaction, then there is a disconnection between fees and exactly when equipment is put on.  You've heard us say it before, and the holistic type of environment we price out activity over a multiyear period. We know exactly what the carriers want to do and what they are willing to pay for. We give them those rights and we put a payment cycle to it as well, which we spread out over time and a little bit more of a consistent manner so it's not as volatile as the activity. So in that context, you may see payments hit before equipment is installed and you can also see payments that after the equipment is installed. It really depends on the payment timeline that's in the holistic deal.\nTom Bartlett : Yeah, and Tim on the other two questions, relative to technology, we have a number of technology consultants that we can -- we use, that I talk with weekly, as well as all of our own internal. We continue as I said before, I believe that macro site is the most efficient way for customers worldwide to be able to deploy their, networks and continue to be so, and as I just mentioned, is what you've seen from our customers talking about rolling out 5G. It's all on the macro sites. So the answer to the question on the, on the technology side is, no, we don't see any competing technologies that we'll get in our way there. From an inflation perspective, 95% of our contracts in the U.S. are on a fixed escalator.  And my sense is that that's it's a very important element of our agreements and that's going to continue to stay. There are going to be some years when it may be a bit higher, although it hasn't been for many, many years. And so generally it's underneath it, but it's also consistent with how we look at our land in terms of the landlords as well. So it's a balance as well between the land -- landlords as well as our customers. So I don't think that there's any unique opportunity to be able to really change that as you well know. We were really -- priced our contracts where it makes sense for our customers to want to be on our sites. And so we continue to look at our pricing along those lines.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nOperator: And I'll turn this back to the speakers for any final closing comments.\nTom Bartlett : Great. Thanks, Leah. And thank you, everyone for joining the call. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation in for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. I hope you and your families are well. Q3 was another quarter of strong performance for us. And as you heard from Tom, we are as encouraged as ever by the technological trends that underpin our long-term growth potential. Before digging into the details of our results and raised outlook, I'd like to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we closed on our strategic partnership agreements with CDPQ and Allianz, through which they purchased an aggregate of 48% of our ATC Europe business for total consideration of around EUR 2.6 billion. In addition, we closed the remaining 4,000 Telsey's communication sites in Germany back in August. With the transaction now fully closed and funded, our teams are working to rapidly integrate the assets and we're already seeing encouraging activity on the portfolio.  Second, we continued to strengthen our Balance Sheet, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes, including our euro offering earlier this month. Through our financing transactions, we've been able to maintain an attractive weighted average cost of debt while also continuing to extend our maturities. As a result of this activity, along with the benefit from a non-recurring advanced payment received from a tenant during the quarter, we finished Q3 with net leverage of 4.9 times. While we expect net leverage to increase back into the low 5 times range in the fourth quarter, we are right on track with our overall post healthiest delevering path. And lastly, we saw another quarter of record services activity in the U.S. as carriers accelerated 5G related projects. We view this as a leading indicator of strong levels of gross leasing in our property segment as we head into 2022 and beyond. And with that, please turn to slide six and I'll review our Q3 property revenue in organic tenant billings, growth. As you can see, our consolidated property revenue grew by over 19% year-over-year or over 18% on an FX -neutral basis to nearly $2.4 billion. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of around 10% and international property revenue growth of over 31% or 13% when excluding the impacts of the Telxius acquisition. This strong performance is indicative of a continuation of the long-term secular trends driving demand for our infrastructure, assets across the globe. Moving to the right side of the slide, we also had a solid quarter of organic tenant billings growth throughout the business.  On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was nearly 5% for a second consecutive quarter. As expected, U.S. 5G investments from the major carriers drove healthy activity levels, leading to organic tenant billings growth in our U.S. and Canada segment of over 4%. Contributions from co-location and amendments were more than 3%, escalators came in at 3.2%, and churn was just over 2%. Moving to our international operations, we drove organic tenant billings growth of nearly 6%, reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 60 basis points. Africa was our fastest-growing region in the quarter, posting organic tenant billings growth of well over 9%, led by Nigeria, where we continue to see 4G investment driving both co-location activity and new site construction.  We also saw a consistent quarter in Latin America, where organic tenant billings growth was right around 7%, driven by solid new business and higher escalators, primarily in Brazil. Meanwhile, European organic tenant billings growth accelerated by around 100 basis points sequentially to nearly 5.5% as expected. Excluding impacts from the Telxius acquisition, organic tenant billings growth in the region would've been over 4.5% in the quarter, more than 200 basis points higher than the year-ago period, driven primarily by new business contributions. This positive trend reflects both ongoing 4G activity and early 5G investments, leading to solid growth from both co-locations and amendments.  Looking to Germany, in particular, we saw a more than 300 basis point increase in co-location and amendment contributions in our legacy business as compared to the prior year period, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of over 5.5% up from 5.2% in the second quarter. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we saw organic tenant billings growth of 0.7% up roughly 200 basis points as compared to Q2. This reflects a modest acceleration in gross new business activity coupled with a more than 2% sequential decline in churn, which was in line with our expectations.  Turning to Slide 7, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew more than 19% or over 18% on an FX neutral basis to nearly $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.2%, which was down compared to Q3 2020. As a result of adding new lower initial tenancy assets to our portfolio, which we believe will drive strong organic growth and therefore margin expansion in the future. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.3%, a roughly 40 basis points sequential improvement. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was over 13%, with consolidated AFFO per share of $2.53, reflecting a per-share growth of nearly 11%.  This was driven by strong performance in our core business, contributions from new assets and around $13 million in year-over-year FX favorability. Our performance also reflected the benefits of our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our operations and minimizing financing costs, despite growing the portfolio by nearly 38,000 sites over the last year. And finally, AFFO per share attributable to AMT common stockholders, was $2.49, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 12%. Let's now turn to our updated outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, our expectations for organic growth across the business are consistent with our prior outlook.  Carriers continued to deploy meaningful capital as they invest in network quality. And we're seeing numerous bands of spectrum being deployed for both 4G and 5G. We are also slightly increasing our expectations for services revenue for the year to around $235 million as a result of an out-sized third quarter. Although this implies that services volumes will moderate somewhat in Q4. Second, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency and cost controls, along with some one-time benefits, we expect to be able to take some costs out of the business as compared to our prior expectations.  Combined with current services gross marginal performance, this will drive our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations higher for the balance of the year. Third, in India, we are encouraged by recent regulatory reforms, which we believe can provide some much needed breathing room for capital constraint carriers in the marketplace and improve the telecom environment overall. While we believe this is a clear positive first step towards market recovery, we continue to expect flat 2021 organic tenant billings growth in the region as we further evaluate the long-term impacts of these developments on the sector. Finally, incorporating the latest FX projections, our current outlook reflects negative FX impacts of $30 million for property revenue, $20 million for adjusted EBITDA, and $15 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations. With that, let's move to the details of our revised full-year outlook.  Looking at Slide 8, as expected, leasing trends remain strong across our global business. And as a result of an increase in pass-through together with some modest core property revenue out-performance, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $10 million. This represents 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and includes $30 million in unfavorable trans - lational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Moving to slide 9, you'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth expectations of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. This includes roughly 3% growth in our U.S. and Canada segment where 5G deployments are driving solid activity levels as we exit the year.  As a reminder, we expect the 1st and largest tranche of contractual sprint churn to hit our run rate in the fourth quarter of this year. And while we expect gross activity to remain solid, our guide implies a Q4 U.S organic tenant billings growth rate of -1% as we communicated previously. On the international side, we continue to anticipate organic tenant billings growth in the range of 5% to 6% as carriers continue to focus their efforts on enhancing indensifying wireless networks in the face of ever-rising mobile data demand. Moving to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $50 million and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 16%.  This increase reflects continued strength in our services segment, where we now expect to see roughly $145 million in services gross margin for the year up from the $123 million implied in our prior guidance with year-over-year growth of more than 180%. On the cost side of the equation, we continue to maintain cost discipline globally, helping to drive adjusted EBITDA margins up by around 40 basis points for the full year as compared to prior expectations. Turning to slide 11, we are also raising our full-year AFFO expectations, and now expect year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of roughly 15%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.64 per share.  The flow-through of incremental cash adjusted EBITDA, coupled with the continued cash tax and net cash interest benefits as compared to the prior expectations, are being partially offset by around $15 million in negative translational FX impacts. on a per-share basis, we now expect growth of approximately 14% for the year consistent with our long-term growth ambitions that we highlighted at the start of the year. Finally, AFFO, attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 12% versus 2020, incorporating the minority interest impacts of our strategic partnership with CDPQ and Allianz in Europe.  Moving onto slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2021. As you can see, we remain focused on deploying capital towards assets that drive strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share, coupled with a growing dividend providing our investors with a compelling combination of growth plus yields. Working our way through the specific categories. Our first priority remains our dividend. For the full year, we continue to expect to distribute $2.3 billion subject to board approval, which implies a roughly 15% year-over-year per-share growth rate. As a reminder, our dividend growth will continue to be driven by underlying growth in our re-taxable income, incorporating the impacts of MLA, and other moving pieces in the business.  Consistent with our prior comments, we anticipate growing our dividend by at least 10% annually in the coming years. Moving on to CapEx, we reiterate our expectations of spending nearly $1.6 billion at the midpoint with nearly 90% being discretionary in nature. Driving a good portion of this discretionary CapEx is our continued expectation to construct 7,000 sites at the midpoint this year, with the vast majority in our international markets. Turning to acquisitions, including contributions from minority partners, we have deployed around $10 billion so far this year, primarily for the Telxius transaction.  As well as for smaller transactions including data site. In total of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployments for the year, we expect over 80% to be composed of discretionary growth CapEx and MLA. Moving to the center of the slide, you can see the composition of our $35 billion in cumulative capital deployments since the start of 2017, including our 2021 full-year expectations. We continue to augment our developed market presence, which we believe positions us optimally to drive value from accelerating 5G deployments and next-generation technology evolutions as Tom laid out earlier.  We are also allocating capital towards higher growth, earlier stage markets that are typically at least 5 years behind the U.S. and Europe in their network deployments. Taken together, we believe that our global footprint positions us to capture multiple waves of investments across the globe over a sustained period of time. Finally, you can see that more than a quarter or around $9.5 billion of our deployed capital in the last 5 years has been distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  We continue to view these components as critical to total shareholder returns. Moving to the right side of the chart, supporting this phase of significant investment and growth has been our investment-grade Balance Sheet. We believe that our access to low-cost diversified sources of financing has been a key differentiator and are proactively working to extend this critical competitive advantage into the future. In fact, incorporating our latest financing efforts, we now have a weighted average cost of debt of around 2.4%. A weighted average tenor of debt of approximately seven years, and over 85% of our Balance Sheet locked into fixed rate instruments.  Finally, on Slide 13, and in summary, in Q3, we continue to capitalize on a strong global demand backdrop, delivering our highest quarter of consolidated AFFO per share on record. This was driven by solid organic growth, record-setting services volumes, disciplined cost controls, strategic balance sheet management, and a creative portfolio expansion. As we look ahead, we believe our existing global real estate portfolio is well positioned to drive long-term recurring growth as carriers augment and extend their networks.  And with the strength of our investment-grade Balance Sheet and diversified pool of funding sources, we expect to continue to deploy capital towards creative investments that can enhance our growth path, and enable us to create additional value. Given our positioning at the intersection of real estate and technology, in an ever more interconnected world, we are excited to continue to deliver connectivity to billions of people worldwide in a sustainable way, while driving compelling total returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Yeah. Okay. Great. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. In terms of the U.S. leasing environment, we're seeing a very strong environment. Certainly all the major carriers have been active. You've seen that show up most notably in our services environment. We've seen a tick up in the contribution from colocation and amendment activity into our organic tenant billings growth, so that's been accelerating through each of the last 3 quarters, just as we expected from the outset in the year. So, in terms of our expectations, everything really is right in line with what we expected. I don't want to get too deep into the second part of your question around growth and activity when it comes to 2022, but I will just reiterate a couple of points that we've already made, so directionally your comments are correct.  We guided to an average organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. for '21 and '22 of around 2%. So, you can see we are coming in here in '21 at around 3%. That suggests around 1% organic tenant billings growth for 2022 in the U.S., so that's where we would expect to be. And again, I'm not providing guidance for next year, just reiterating the components of our long-term plan. And maybe one thing that I will highlight here just briefly is that Sprint churn hit us in Q4 for the first time, that first tranche, as you heard in my comments, so Sprint churn, now that it's active, I will just give you the numbers there again, 2021 we are rolling off 195 million of annual Sprint revenue in churn, in 2022, we'll roll off an additional 60, 2023 we'll roll off another 50 million, in 2024 we'll roll-off another 70 million. So that's Sprint churn, and that's what's really causing the lower organic growth rate within our U.S. business. Next year, the gross growth, we see the environment being very strong, accelerating through 2021, and we expect that to continue going in. Just to give you a couple of the piece parts in terms of the impact it will have on the fourth quarter, you will see organic tenant billings growth rates in the U.S. around a negative 1%, and that will include churn for the quarter of about 6.6%, and embedded within that is about 4.5% just from the Sprint churn.  And of course, all of this will have an impact on AFFO in terms of going forward into future years. So, we've guided that our goal is to hit double-digit AFFO growth on average from 2021 through 2027. And of course, some years it will be higher, some years it will be lower. The goal really is an average. And when you think about 2022 and this first tranche of Sprint churn kind of rolling through, that's a year that I would say that would be challenging to get to 10%. I'll also say, Michael, we haven't given up on it. There are certain levers that we can pull and things that we can do with the business to maximize AFFO and AFFO per share growth. And we're doing all of those -- all of those things. So that kind of puts a little bit of context around the U.S. activity for this year and rolling into next year. Great. Thanks for the question and good morning. And thanks for being on this call. So with advanced prepayment, I'm not going to provide details around that. I will say it was a little over $1 billion from one of our customers. It really is just a prepayment for lease payments going out over, let's say the next 12 months, so it will kind of run through our financial statements pretty quickly. And there's nothing more to it than just a prepayment of the next 12 months, kind of leasing fees. So from our perspective is it's not a big deal that helps with liquidity, brought our leverage down a little bit. You thought we ended a little bit below five times in terms of leverage. So it wasn't a bad thing for us to do, but it's a pretty simple transaction and I wouldn't want you to read any more into it than that.  In terms of supply chain, Tom may want to add a few comments here, but from a supply chain, we see no major impacts at this point, certainly across our business. As you can see in our services business, we continue to hit higher and higher levels of activity and bringing our outlook up again for another consecutive quarter here. We've got access to the cruise. You've also seen our margins expanding in the services business in particular, and in the U.S. we're not building a tremendous amount of Tower, so we certainly don't have any restrictions or challenges from that perspective.  One place I would say going into 2022, we will be keeping our eye on crew availability and labor and things like that. If the environment stays the way it is, we should be fine if things get worse, we'll need to keep our eye on it. We do buy a lot of generators. We have generated orders out that are already in place. That brings us out into the beginning to the middle of 2022. So from that perspective, we know we're going to get some materials we need or we expect to get the materials we need and feel pretty good about that.  But in the second half of 2022, again, we'll continue to watch the supply chain issues. And to the extent that there are any issues that get worse, we'll continue. to keep an eye on it and kind of pull the levers, but from where we sit now, we don't think we'll -- we don't see anything hitting us right now. We don't expect any challenges through the middle of 2022, and beyond that, it's too early to comment. We'll just keep our eye on it. Yeah, so the cap maintenance there is going to pop up in Q4. I think you see that you just mentioned in terms of our guide. It really is just timing, and it's a timing issue that we've seen in prior years. So if you look back at our last year, spread and maintenance CapEx, you'll see kind of the same sort of cycle. It is a Cash CapEx number, so it does lag a little bit in terms of the activity. So you see this kind of spike in leasing activity that's going -- that's running through our services revenue. And then you kind of see following on from that, you'll see an uptick in the maintenance CapEx that we run through to support the towers and maintain everything out of the tower sites. So it really is just a timing issue, Matt. Yeah. Sure, Ric. I'll -- good morning. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So let's say the interest rates are -- so you've seen us, Ric, over the last several quarters, even the last couple of years, very active in the capital markets, very active in terms of our debt structure, capital structure, and in different things like that. We've been focused on strengthening our balance sheet in a very proactive way. We now have our average maturities out over about 7 years with an average cost of debt down to about 2.4% or so. And 85% of our debt is now fixed out over the long term. So that's a heavier weighting towards fixed to variable compared to our kind of standard financial policy.  So we've been preparing for an environment where interest rates may tick up so we think from an interest rate perspective, our Balance Sheet is very solid and ready for it. There's nothing we can do about preventing interest rates from rising. We do think they may rise over time modestly, but we're very well prepared for it. The other thing I would add is in terms of global capital allocation, and looking to invest capital, the strength of our Balance Sheet really does represent a competitive advantage for us, particularly in a time when interest rates may be rising. So we'll keep an eye on that and look to be very opportunistic as we go forward from that perspective.  And then when you think about inflation rates, one of the ways you will see that run through our businesses is many of our contracts internationally, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are all geared towards inflation rates and the escalator is adjusted based on inflation rate. So as and when we see higher levels of inflation in the international markets, we'll see higher levels of growth as well in the U.S. And remind you that our escalators are fixed at around 3%. That's been consistent for a long time. So we're pretty well insulated from interest rates rising in the U.S. from a balance sheet perspective, but we still lock in that revenue growth of 3% on the U.S. escalator. Hey, Ric, you mentioned attributable. Maybe I'll just give you a couple of data points there because we have -- you've seen over the last quarter or so, we've had a few moving pieces with closing the Telxius transaction in numerous tranches. We also brought in private capital. It may be a good time to just level set that. So for the full year, we're looking -- you can see in our presentation, in terms of AFFO attributable to our minority, shareholders is about 100 million, and that breaks down 75 million roughly for the European business and about 25 million for the India business. The way our partners breakdown is, you know CDPQ owns 30% of our European business and Aliansce owns about 18% of that business.  PGGM holds about 17% in Germany, and about 13% in Spain. We have Macquarie as a partner over in India, they own about 8%. Now is a good time to kind of think about the run rate aspect of that minority interest. When you look at Q4, now that all the dust has settled, we think the run rate -- a good ballpark run rate is about 40 million for Q4. So if you annualize that, you get a range of 150 to 160, that would be attributable to the minority interest partners. The one word, actually I would say is, we will -- we did receive the put from a core where you've seen that in our filings. So we will eventually close on that and that'll be an adjustment to the numbers at that -- at that time. Yeah, I'll get the first one, Tom, around the payment cycle and equipment installation. Tim, I would say that it really works in a variety of ways depending on which contracts you're talking about and how it's structured. Certainly on a pay by the drink type of in all our contract, carriers would pay us lease by lease as and when they install the equipment, or probably better, more precisely said, when the contract gets executed and the commencement date is triggered, and that's typically when the building permit is pulled and construction starts or certainly by the time that the equipment is installed, if you looking at more of a holistic transaction, then there is a disconnection between fees and exactly when equipment is put on.  You've heard us say it before, and the holistic type of environment we price out activity over a multiyear period. We know exactly what the carriers want to do and what they are willing to pay for. We give them those rights and we put a payment cycle to it as well, which we spread out over time and a little bit more of a consistent manner so it's not as volatile as the activity. So in that context, you may see payments hit before equipment is installed and you can also see payments that after the equipment is installed. It really depends on the payment timeline that's in the holistic deal."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. Consistent with our prior Q3 callSteward, my comments today will center on the key trends driving our business now, and how we think the technological landscape will develop in the future. I'll touch on how we're positioned to benefit as 5G deployments accelerate in cloud-native applications in the edge of all, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, I'll spend some time discussing our European markets, where we now have a scaled presence and are poised to create further value as technology evolves there and then briefly cover what we are seeing in our earlier stage international markets. Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets and the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future.  At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations. And the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue Steward to drive our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we're excited about, and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term. Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success, and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future as macro towers should remain the most cost, and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide. Our conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time, supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless capex spending in markets like the United States, and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally. We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the 2.5 gig band currently being deployed in the U.S, as the workhorse of the true 5G experience.  And we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of these sub-6-gig frequencies compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum, to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multi-year period of strong growth on our tower sitesSteward. We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S. today, generating record services revenues, driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments.  Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless CapEx spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next five years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last five years, and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade. This compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term non-cancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027, and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that same period.  I will touch on this further in a few minutes, but as a quick reminder, these baseline growth expectations exclude any material contributions from our various platform expansion initiatives. What they do include are expectations for an extended period of solid growth in our European markets, where we are seeing similar network growth trends in the United StatesSteward with early-stage 5G deployments set to accelerate in the coming years. We expect that our newly scaled European presence will allow us to drive long-term value creation as the explosion of mobile data usage across the region continues and the need for communications infrastructure accelerates as a result.  Across Germany, Spain, and France, where 5G mobile subscriptions currently make up less than 5% of the total user base, we expect mobile data usage per smartphone to grow by more than 25% annually for the next five years, similar to the United States, and consequently expect CapEx spend across the three markets to exceed $11 billion annually over a similar time period. And as happened in the U.S. we're already seeing this acceleration in network investment translate into elevated activity. In fact, in the third quarter, normalizing for the impacts of Telxius Steward deal, co-locationSteward and amendment contributions to European organic tenant billings growth rose by around 200 basis points year-over-year.  Although we expect a significant portion of initial 5G investments to be focused in urban locations across our European footprint where Steward roughly 80% of the population resides, we anticipate urban-oriented consumer demand to be complemented by an ongoing push from European regulators to deliver rural connectivity, which will represent another opportunity for us to drive co-location on our tower sites in those areas. We believe our balance of rural and recently expanded urban assets positions us well to capture significant market share of upcoming 5G deployments over the next decade.  Finally, in our earlier stage, markets across Latin America, Asia, and Africa, we continue to see solid demand for our critical infrastructure, largely driven by deployment of legacy network technologies, particularly 4G. Whether looking at Brazil, Mexico, India, or Nigeria, consumers are rapidly increasing their utilization of smartphones, thereby driving mobile data usage growth higher. In many of these regions, existing network infrastructure is insufficient to support this deluge Stewardof usage as cell-site Steward performance is challenged with increased levels of network load. In response to these trends, we are aggressively marketing our existing assets and continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities to bolster our footprint in these markets.  But at the same time, we have significantly ramped up our new build program given the tremendous need for entirely new infrastructure. In fact, if you take the nearly 5,900 sites we built last year and add our expected 7,000 sites at the midpoint of our outlook to be constructed this year, it would represent almost as many sites as the previous 5-years combined. And as we laid out a few quarters ago, we are targeting the construction of up to 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years. With day one NOI yields on these builds continuing to average above 10%, we are excited about deploying significant capital to these initiatives going forward, as we capitalize on the advancement of network technology across the emerging world. While helping to connect billions of people. In addition, to the core secular growth trends driving our Global Tower business, we're seeing indications, particularly in more mature markets like the U.S., of a broad evolution within the overall wireless ecosystem, as Evolution is closely intertwined with 5G and includes an increased prevalence of cloud native network solutions. More emphasis on the various permutations of the network edge. And an ever-increasing intersection of the wired and wireless portions of today's converged network architecture. As networks virtualize O-RAN or Open RAN, is expected to become a more important option to improve their economics.  We are now starting to see this phenomenon with DISH in the U.S. and in Germany were 1&1 is spoken extensively about its intent to utilize this technology. By utilizing O-RAN, carriers have the potential to optimize network design and drive cost efficiencies, freeing up incremental capital to invest in densification and other network enhancements that help drive growth in site deployments in co-locations. Importantly, the role of the Tower in this evolving network design is as critical as ever. While base station functionality will likely continue to evolve to be cloud native software Agile, the radio equipment that is placed on the tower itself, which has always driven our revenue, will continue to reside on the Tower.  Importantly, we believe we can leverage our extensive global distributed real estate portfolio to not only drive continued strong growth within our core Tower business, but also to take advantage of other emerging opportunities as Networks virtualize. This may include multi-access edge computing, and potential other Edge Cloud permutations of neutral host infrastructure. At the end of the day, modern software driven networks are becoming smarter, faster, more capable, and more dynamic. And we're focused on ensuring that American Tower has a meaningful role to play in this context on the infrastructure and real estate side of the equation. One of the areas we focused on is the development of the network edge. Or more accurately, the development of multiple layers of the network edge, with the need for lower latency expected to become more and more critical over time with applications like AR, VR telemedicine, real-time analytics, autonomous driving, entertainment streaming.  You name it, and many others are beginning to merge. We continue to believe that this can be a meaningful opportunity for American Tower. As we've done more work on the evolution of the Edge, the concept of multiple edge layers has come into better focus. Today, for example, by far the most prevalent layer is the regional Metro edge owned for the most part by the large data center companies where vast amounts of data processing is in centralized. These locations provide access to cloud on-ramps and are absolutely critical within today's networks. We expect this need to be the case for the foreseeable future. In fact, if the volume of data carried across networks continues to explode, we anticipate the demand for these types of large scale facilities will only grow.  The upside of these locations is their size and capacity. The downside, which to this point hasn't been all that relevant, is the fairly significant network transit costs in latency built into reaching the central compute functions. As the data often has to travel hundreds of miles to reach these destinations. These transit costs and latency considerations, which we expect to become more important in the future, will necessitate more edge locations as up linked data increases from IOT use cases and demands for distributed computing advance. The next layer beyond the Metro edge in our view, will be the aggregation edge.  Here you're likely to host Syrian hubs in future MEK applications as network virtualization advances, along with distributed data processing, AI inferencing, and other compute functions, which will need reduced latency. The major hyper-scalars continue to evolve their edge cloud platforms, so that they can extend computing capabilities deeper into the mobile access network at the aggregation edge. The next layer beyond this, which we term the access edge, is where our existing tower sites are located today, offering an opportunity to meaningfully enhance the value of our legacy real estate.  We expect to eventually see V-RAD and O-RAN network functions, AI inferencing, Data Cashing, and a variety of other next-generation AR and VR cloud-native, ultra-low latency applications residing at these locations. Finally, we've also identified the on-premise edge, which would lie beyond even our tower sites and could eventually help support private networks, smart factories, and a host of other applications located at the end-user's site. The end of the day, our 20,000 foot view is that all of these edge elements will need to fit together to provide a cohesive framework for full scale 5G across the network ecosystem. The goal for us is to figure out what the optimal linkages between the layers look like.  Who the key players will be. And what elements of the edge we may want to own in order to further enhance the strong long-term growth we expect from our core existing business. To date, as we seek to connect the dots, we've been active with a number of trial edge compute sites at the access edge, while also operating our COLO-ATL Metro Data Center interconnection facility in Atlanta. Through these investments, we have built relationships with key existing and potential future customers. I've learned a tremendous amount about key demand trends, and I've had a front row seat for the beginning stages of the convergence of wireless and wireline networks that I alluded to earlier.  More recently, we acquired DataSite, a data center Company consisting of two multi-tenant data centers in the Atlanta area and in Orlando. In addition to strengthening our existing position in Atlanta, the addition of a network dense carrier hotel facility in Orlando, provides us with a strong Southeastern presence, with a profile and characteristics that we believe will be critical in the early evolution of the Metro edge, as we evaluate its role in the mobile networks of the future. We expect these facilities, which have 18 megawatts of combined power and additional 4.5 megawatts of expansion capacity, to effectively complement COLO-ATL and enable us to enhance our ability to develop neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud data centers to support the broader Quarta Edge connectivity evolution in the U.S..  We continue to believe that while a scaled, application, driven edge oriented business model, is still likely several years away, it has the potential to be a sizable market opportunity with meaningful potential upside. Not only in the U.S., but also on a global basis. Leading global M&O's are now positioning their networks with Release 16, 5G stand-alone core features to explore Edge Cloud opportunities. And with our distributed macro side presence, key markets around the world, we think we're well-positioned to potentially be a provider of choice on the edge, particularly for large multinational M&O's, and other categories of customers who maybe looking for a multi-market solution.  Switching gears a bit, while we believe edge compute will eventually also be relevant in emerging markets, it is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Consequently, we have focused our platform expansion efforts across our developing regions in other areas, most notably on increasing the sustainability and efficiency of power provisioning in our sites. As we highlighted in our recently published 2020 corporate sustainability report. We've continued to make progress toward our goal of reducing diesel-related greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2027, from a 2017 baseline. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019 reaching 53% of the 10-year of goal.  We're continuing to make solid progress in 2021 with an expectation to spend an additional $80 million or its energy efficient solutions primarily in lithium, Ion, and solar power across our Africa footprint, which will bring our cumulative spend to nearly $250 million. And as we announced earlier this week, we are furthering our commitment to combat climate change by adopting science-based targets, which we expect to help inform our future investments and sustainability. In addition to the positive environmental benefits from these investments, we are also delivering shareholder value through AFFO per share accretion. Lithium-ion batteries provide significant energy efficiency, density, and lifespan improvements over legacy solutions.  And while to-date, AFFO benefits to American Tower have largely come through fuel savings, we anticipate over time that our yields on these investments will further expand as we are able to lengthen battery and generator replacement cycles. Having already expanded our lithium-ion powered site count from 4500 in 2019 to 6700 in 2020, we are targeting another 8,000 sites by the end of 2022. And recently signed a multi-million dollar bulk battery purchase agreement in Africa in support of this goal. Importantly, we believe that energy efficiency, the use of renewables and sustainability in our broader sense, can represent an important competitive advantage for us.  Not only from the flow through to AFFO, but also the differentiation and service quality for our customers. We continue to view sustainability as a critical component of our Company culture and will be highlighting our continued progress in future sustainability reports, which I encourage all of you to read by the way. In closing, our excitement around 5G on a global basis continues to grow. Consumers and enterprises are using more advanced devices for more things, resulting in consistent elevated growth in mobile data usage, which in turn strains existing wireless networks and necessitates incremental densification and network improvement. Considerable new spectrum is being deployed, new entrants and select markets are building Greenfield networks.  And our macro Tower oriented portfolio remains well-positioned to capture a significant portion of wireless investment activity. In addition, through our platform expansion strategy, we are focused on ensuring that the Company benefits from the ongoing convergence of wireless and wireline and the associated expansion of virtualization in cloud native applications throughout the network ecosystem. Importantly, as we optimize our core business, and look for ways to further enhance our growth path in the broader digital infrastructure world. We are as committed as ever to driving profitability, sustainability, and recurring growth. We're energized by the future and are excited to be in a vibrant industry that is helping to connect the world. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full-year 2021 outlook. Rod. Thanks, Michael. Maybe, Rod, why don't you take the first part of the question. And then I'll fill in on the second piece. And Michael, relative to your second question, you can tell that we're obviously energized and excited about the opportunity at the edge. I mean the impetus right now is really 5G and driving all of these lower latency types of applications and needs out further into the market closer and closer to the end user. We've always said from a digital transformation perspective, it's going to be cloud-based, it's going to be connected, and it's going to be distributed. And we think we're in a very good competitive position given the vast amount of distribution that we have in the 25 markets that we\u2019re Steward servicing.  So we're trying to position ourselves inSteward this broader market to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. We're going to do it intelligently. Our execution strategy continues to evolve. We think we've done it intelligently in terms of picking up some of the Metro sites, building out our own sites. We have some market agreements in place to drive access into those sites, and this is going to evolve. This is not going to happen overnight as you well know. And so, we've got partnerships in place to be able to look at this. We're going to be able to hopefully leverage Steward some of those partnerships, and we'll just continue to monitor the best approach in terms of being able to best position ourselves, to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.  We've done that in the past in terms of being smart in terms of how we allocate capital to these types of investments. Will it take the form of partnerships owning -- further owning more metro sites, unclear at this point in time. That will continue to evolve as the market continues to evolve, but we do think we're in a really good position in terms of being able to leverage our real estate -- our exclusive real estate and to be able to take advantage of that neutral host model. You bet. Yes, thanks for the question and good morning. So we did see organic tenant billings in Asia kind of turned a corner here and gets a positive. So we posted a 0.7% positive growth rate. We're still looking for the full year to be right around 0. And as we look at the market, we remain optimistic in terms of the gross activity. So the way that even that 0.7 organic tenant billings for the quarter, I will give you a little bit of the breakdown there. So we're seeing high single-digits, nearly double-digit organic new business that's been pretty consistent for at least 6 to 8 consecutive quarters. And based on where they are in their development kind of transitioning from 3G to 4G networks. We expect that that gross demand should continue, the escalators are locked in right around 2 to 2.2% or so we have that to count on.  We have seen a moderation and a pretty sharp decline here year-over-year in terms of the churn rate. So a year ago, Q3 churn in India was about 13.5%, it's down now about 7.5%. We think that's certainly a very favorable sign and one that we expected to see, and we hope to continue to see that going forward. In terms of the -- we did see that there was some good news from the government in terms of regulatory support for the industry. And we think that that will help the market in general, the whole sector as well as the carriers, particularly the ones with the AGR dues.  But all the carriers, even with just spectrum fees, strengthen their own Balance Sheet, kind of regroup and gear up for competition in this sector there and to invest in their networks. So we are optimistic about going forward growth rates there, but we would expect, let's call it high single-digit organic growth with churn levels there, in the mid-single-digits and hopefully moderating down over time. Yes, thanks for the question. I'll take the first part there and so from when you look at our business over in Europe, we are very pleased with the trajectory of the growth rates over they you've seen a couple of sequential quarters of increased organic growth rates, just as we expected to see now that the market has seen a reduction in churn, they're gearing up for 5G deployments, so that's been really good to see. In terms of the piece parts of the organic tenant billings, certainly the Telefonica, additional sites plays a role in there. One of the biggest ways that it plays in early on, it's still very early in terms of bringing those assets in, but I think we've talked before about the assets there in Europe that they basically have a long-term contract and there on other tenant material, other tenants on there.  So there's really very little churn that will -- that's possible on that portfolio. So we have very low turn expectations on that portfolio and it's a big chunk of revenue, that certainly helps inflect the growth rates to go up higher. And then in terms of the question with drilage one-on-one, we really don't want to comment on ongoing negotiations, but negotiations continue there I can assure you. Hey David, if Tom, I can start and Rod can add in. With regards to Europe, we think we have a really solid position in them. And a few of the critical markets, we've got good scale in the markets we've got a great relationship, obviously with Telefonic and O-RAN in particular, and so we're, energized by the type of growth that we are now seeing in the marketplace. But we continue to look at opportunities to further build scale, not just in the 3 markets that we're in, but also if there are other opportunities, but only if it makes sense, like everything else that we do. And so there are, I think, a lot of opportunities in the region, and we're evaluating them as you would expect. And to the extent that there's some opportunities there to secure some of that portfolio to gain further scale even in the markets that we're in.  And relationships with key customers, we'll clearly look to do that. And so Europe is -- as we've said, an area or part of the world that we look to continue to further develop if it makes sense. With regards to Telefonica, again, we've got a great global relationship with them. They are positioning to an MVNO as you all know, and they're going to have some time for that to be able to -- for that to occur. There will be some churn over time, but the contract that we have with them, I think goes out for several years at this point in time. And so we'll continue to monitor that and we've managed these types of events. I think quite well over -- over our history. And I'm sure we will do that here. Sure, Dave. Hi, Ric. Ric, it comes back to the same model that we've been executing for the last decade. It's looking to build up scale, looking at the counter party, looking at the market itself, and then looking at the transaction itself, what additional capital has got to go into the portfolio to be able to ensure it, so we can support a second or third 10, and what is the growth profile look like. They're probably a dozen different elements of that evaluation that go into deciding whether in fact we would be interested, and then driving what that price is.  We've used the same 10-year discounted cash flow approach and continue to use it. Obviously, the variables change but largely -- I meant the actual numbers, but largely the variables themselves from a qualification perspective are the same. And so we'll look at those and look at all of those opportunities, we think about globally how to allocate capital. You talked about the pipeline of transactions? Yes. I mean, it's been very consistent. I mean, the pipeline itself there are -- there's more activity as you've seen, and as you report on in Western Europe. And, but in terms of the pipeline, in terms of the opportunities, they remain relatively consistent. Overall, if you look at our total portfolio, the last count I did we owned about a third of the inventory and all of the markets. And so there's still a lot of opportunity in the markets that we're in. Given how carriers, our existing customers, carriers are looking at continually looking at trying to monetize their portfolio. Smaller tower co's are looking for opportunities to exit. There was private capital involved in some of those smaller tower co's.  And so, they're looking to monetize some of their funds. Some increased opportunity in Southeast Asia that's going on as we speak, as you've well seen. But it's been -- the pipeline has been very consistent. I would say where it's a little bit out sized is probably the all of the noise is going on in Western Europe. And there just seems to be a lot of activity going on there as you've seen, as we've seen in the -- all of the public comments. And so it's probably a bit of an out-sized pipeline in that region, but other than that, it's been very consistent. Great. Yeah, Jonathan. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I don't want to go through the churn carrier-by-carrier. But I think you do know that there are a few customers in Latin America that are exiting the businesses or that have been consolidated. So we do have the next exit down in the Brazil area. We do have Telefonica transitioning to the MVNO in that -- in the Mexico market and moving onto the AT&T site. Some of that churns began. You've seen a bump up in our non-run rate activity in Latin America for some decommissioning in Brazil that is related to the next cell sites coming down that will continue into next year.  So you'll see a bump up in churn, and then you will also see a bump up in that non-run rate as well. And then there are -- you will see some benefits to some of the churn that come through a settlement payment. And there are a few other smaller customers, but that probably gives you a flavor of who's there, and what's happening in Latin America from a churn perspective. I think in Nigeria, we've seen very strong growth for the last several quarters here. We expect that to continue. We've got a great portfolio in Nigeria was a solid anchor tenant with MTN in there as a partner of ours. So that's been really good. I would say that as long as the economy, and the economy in Nigeria is largely driven by fuel prices, as long as that's good, I think we're in really good shape because we've got a great portfolio in the country. and the carriers will continue to invest capital and build out sites. We've got a pretty robust build program there, so you've seen the guide with 7,000 thousand sites that we expect to build as a good chunk of those in Africa. And in Africa, a lot of them they're in Nigeria.  So I would say that we are very bullish on Nigeria in terms of the growth rates we're seeing high single-digit, if not double-digit, organic growth rates in Nigeria. As long as the economy there continues to roll forward I think we're in really good shape and that's largely, I believe, based on fuel pricing. Hey, John. It's consistent with what we've said in the past. We've got I think a terrific relationship with Verizon. I can't comment on anything specifically relative to negotiations or those types of things. But we want to be able to service our customers and be strategic to them, as makes sense for them. And so we'll look to continue dialog if they're looking for more of our card type of pricing we'll go in that direction. If they're looking for renewal for realistic will go in that direction. More to come, but they're very active in the marketplace. They're very aggressive in terms of building out their network, and I think we've seen it. They talked about it. And they are doing a terrific job, and we're here to support them however best we can. On Telxius I can tell you day one, we were marketing those sites. Okay. So we're as aggressively as we possibly can in terms of providing those sites out to our customers. The integration has gone really well. And it takes time from a system perspective and getting that organized, getting them into systems and integrating systems and things like that, that can I can take 6 months to a year. but that doesn't prevent us from marketing those sides to our customers and making them available to all of our customers will be aggressive from a capital perspective, to the extent that there are some sites that we need to attend to, from a structural perspective, to be able to support them. But I've said all along, and this was a really terrifically built portfolio, and that was one of the attractions to the portfolio to begin with.  So we're being as aggressively as we can to really be able to take advantage of these sites, particularly markets like Germany and Spain, where 5G is really picking up. From a U.S. perspective, you're right. If you go back to even old analog days, the markets were generally built up from your urban markets, because that's where you're able to get the best bang for the buck when you're rolling out capital. This one though, I would say, with 5G is broader. It is a goal to get nationwide coverage for all the customers.  And then to continue to fill it in as demand and as capacity requirements are required. What's not a surprise to us, and I reiterated in my comments, the macro towers is the main asset that our customers are deploying 5G on. And I never had any doubts of that, simply because I've been involved in the industry for 30 years. So the macro tower is just the best way for our customers to get that signal out to their customers. And so we're seeing that, but we are seeing it more across the entire country. Again, as customers are really trying to be able to get to that nationwide coverage. You bet. Sure, Tim. Go ahead, Rod, you take that first. Yeah, and Tim on the other two questions, relative to technology, we have a number of technology consultants that we can -- we use, that I talk with weekly, as well as all of our own internal. We continue as I said before, I believe that macro site is the most efficient way for customers worldwide to be able to deploy their, networks and continue to be so, and as I just mentioned, is what you've seen from our customers talking about rolling out 5G. It's all on the macro sites. So the answer to the question on the, on the technology side is, no, we don't see any competing technologies that we'll get in our way there. From an inflation perspective, 95% of our contracts in the U.S. are on a fixed escalator.  And my sense is that that's it's a very important element of our agreements and that's going to continue to stay. There are going to be some years when it may be a bit higher, although it hasn't been for many, many years. And so generally it's underneath it, but it's also consistent with how we look at our land in terms of the landlords as well. So it's a balance as well between the land -- landlords as well as our customers. So I don't think that there's any unique opportunity to be able to really change that as you well know. We were really -- priced our contracts where it makes sense for our customers to want to be on our sites. And so we continue to look at our pricing along those lines. Great. Thanks, Leah. And thank you, everyone for joining the call. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks everyone."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kate Ruppe, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover the quarter's highlights, and Steve and Jeff will discuss sales and financial results in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, including operating revenues of $162 million, resulting in 7.7% year-over-year growth and FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42, which is year-over-year growth of 5.2%, excluding the impact of a onetime benefit of $0.06 per share that Jeff will discuss later. Second quarter sales results included new and expansion leases of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which consisted of $7 million of retail colocation and small scale leasing, above the trailing 12 month average and $0.8 million of large-scale leasing. We are pleased with our retail and small-scale leasing so far this year. And as Steve will discuss, we expect more volume in large-scale leases in future months as the funnel of these longer cycle opportunities should bear fruit. Our sales trends confirm the findings in the 2021 state of the Data Center Survey that International Data Group recently published, which shows colocation emerging as a key element for modern IT enterprises, bridging multiple cloud and service providers to provide a robust foundation for driving innovation. The full survey is available on our Web site. Turning to our property development. The LA3 Phase 2 construction project remains on track for Q4 2021 delivery, and we completed a pre-lease for a scale deployment this quarter to an existing customer. We also achieved a lease percentage of 89% at LA3 Phase 1, reflecting the strength of our position in the Los Angeles market and solid sales activity. In addition, we placed a new 4-megawatt computer room at NY2 under development with an estimated Q1 2022 delivery date. We continue to see strong demand in the New York market, particularly in the financial services industry. The new Boston chiller plant project has been completed. We expect the chiller to provide a positive return on investment through improved power efficiency and utilization. As you know from our 2020 sustainability report, energy efficiency is a key focus for CoreSite. And finally, we received zoning approval from the Santa Clara City Council for our SV9 development, an important entitlement, and we continue to work through the remaining pre-construction activities to bring SV9 to a shovel ready state. We achieved a valuable milestone at our SV8 data center, which reached stabilization during the quarter at 98% occupancy, less than two years from the delivery of Phase 1 with financial returns expected to achieve our underwriting with some additional time and maturation. On the connectivity front, we recently announced on-net availability to Google Cloud natively on our Chicago and Silicon Valley campuses, further supporting Google's partner interconnect and validating the importance attributed to our portfolio by key cloud partners. In summary, we have solid accomplishments for the first half of the year, and Jeff will discuss their positive impact on guidance. We are executing well on our 2021 goals to translate our new and vacant capacity into sales opportunities to attract high quality logos that value our campus ecosystems, to expand our connectivity options and relationships to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and to return to mid to high single digit growth in revenues, earnings and FFO per share. We remain optimistic about the fundamental market drivers supporting our go-to-market strategy, technology requiring low latency, high performance, hybrid cloud IT architectures continue to play an increasingly important role in the success of businesses. And CoreSite is well positioned to capture an attractive share of the edge needs in our major metropolitan markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I will start by recapping our second quarter sales results and then discuss some key themes and notable wins. As Paul mentioned, we delivered new and expansion sales of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, which included $3.4 million annualized GAAP rent from retail colocation leases and $4.4 million of GAAP rent from scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 33,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $235 per square foot, as well as 26 new logos that were added to our customer ecosystem with opportunities for future growth. I will highlight a few specific use cases from these new logos in a moment. New and expansion pricing on a kilowatt basis this quarter was above the trailing 12 month average by low to mid-teens, reflecting the unique use cases and mix of both size and location of leases signed this quarter. Contributing to this, our new and expansion sales of retail and small scale leasing was also above the trailing 12 month average. These leasing categories are a primary focus as they often represent performance sensitive applications requiring high interoperability and hybrid cloud architectures. These deployments also typically drive incremental power margin in interconnection revenues, improving profitability while enhancing the ecosystem. To supplement the retail and small scale sales results, our team is working hard to deliver more value add, large scale and hyperscale leasing throughout the second half of 2021, although, actual timing can be affected by the complexities and longer sales cycles of these larger deployments. Consistent with our strategy, we saw strong organic growth and demand from existing customers, who accounted for 86% of annualized GAAP rents signed during the second quarter as their digital architectures evolved and expand. Noteworthy expansions from existing customers included scaled edge deployments from a digital content customer and a public cloud customer expanding their footprints in the Los Angeles market to support their growing customer demand; a scaled expansion from a higher education customer in the New York market leading to support its high performance research computing; and scaled expansions from a financial derivatives exchange and a global investment management firm, enhancing our high quality financial services ecosystem in the New York market. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets for new and expansion leases in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed were Los Angeles, New York and Northern Virginia, which combined represented 75% of our annualized GAAP rent signed during the quarter. Turning to notable new customer wins. The 26 new logos signed represents $1.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 14% of our sales during the quarter, including six new customers executing multi-market contracts. We effectively competed for and won 15 separate deployments across multiple markets from these six customers as they looked to solve for their distributed technical requirements, including high interoperability, robust security and enhanced reliability. Attracting high-quality new logos looking for this type of interoperability further strengthens the flywheel effect of our densely interconnected campus model and portfolio ecosystem. Enterprises contributed 93% of new logo annualized GAAP rents signed during this quarter and included an investment management firm join our rising financial services ecosystem in the New York market and another prominent law firm, known for its strategic work for major enterprises deploying in both New York and the Northern Virginia markets. Finally, we ended the second quarter at 84.1% of total data center occupancy, increasing our occupancy by 220 basis points since the beginning of the year and furthering our progress towards our targeted goal in the high 80s range. As we look to the second half of 2021, we are well positioned to capture the demand for edge use cases with high performance, hybrid and multi-cloud IT requirements, which we expect to drive significant value to the lease-up of our available capacity. We are working on attractive large scale and selective hyperscale opportunities that align with our campus value and shareholder objectives, and we remain optimistic about the sales funnel for the second half of 2021. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our second quarter financial results, balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, and then review our financial outlook and updated 2021 guidance. We achieved another strong quarter of financial results. Operating revenues were $162.1 million, an increase of 7.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date through Q2, the three components of data center revenues, rents, power and interconnection revenues, increased year-over-year at 6%, 10% and 9% respectively. As a reminder, our reported new and expansion sales results only include the rental revenue component of the new leases. Lease renewals equaling $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent were finalized during the quarter, resulting in cash rent mark-to-market of 4.2% and GAAP mark-to-market of 7.1%. Year-to-date, our cash rent mark-to-market equals 3.4%, exceeding our initial guidance range. We also incurred churn of 1.3% for the quarter within our more normal historical range as we expected. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $8.4 million of annualized GAAP rent, revenue backlog consisting of $8.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or $15.6 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. The difference between the GAAP and cash backlog is primarily driven by a handful of scale leases with power ramps in the early portion of their lease terms. We expect approximately 70% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the third quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence during the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.1% year-over-year. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 8.2%, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, also an improvement over the guidance provided at the beginning of the year. Net income was $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year and $0.08 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.48. I recommend you look at the FFO per share results on an adjusted basis of $1.42 per share, which removes the impact of a onetime benefit of $3.1 million or $0.06 per share, resulting from the release of a tax liability that we no longer expect to be incurred. FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42 is an increase of $0.07 or 5.2% year-over-year. Year-to-date, FFO per share as adjusted increased 6.8%. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA decreased to 5 times as of June 30th. We saw organic deleveraging again this quarter as we continue to lease the capacity we developed over the last few years and realize the corresponding adjusted EBITDA growth. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.9 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $264.3 million of liquidity and therefore, the capital to fully fund our 2021 business plan. Turning to 2021 guidance. We are increasing our guidance related to net income attributable to common diluted shares to our new range of $1.99 to $2.07 per share. In addition, our guidance related to 2021 FFO per share as adjusted has been increased from our previous range of $5.42 to $5.52 per share to our new guidance range of $5.52 to $5.6 per share. The increase of $0.09 at the midpoint or approximately 1.6% is largely driven by an increase in operating revenues, improved adjusted EBITDA margins and to a lesser extent by lower than anticipated interest expense. We also increased our cash rent mark-to-market guidance to a range of 2% to 4% from our previous range of 0% to 2%. Other than the changes noted here and those on Page 21 of our supplemental, our 2021 guidance and related drivers remain unchanged. A few items to keep in mind related to our capital expenditures guidance. A portion of expansion capital spend in the second half of 2021 is dependent on the timing of our development at SV9, which could push into 2022, resulting in lower than anticipated capital spend this year. And with the completion of our investments in the SV1 office floor build-out and the Boston cooling infrastructure, both of which are expected to generate attractive returns on investment, our recurring CapEx will decrease and return to more normal levels in the second half of this year. And therefore, increase our AFFO to FFO ratio prospectively. In closing, as we move into the second half of 2021, we will continue to focus on our goal to lease-up our available capacity to achieve a portfolio occupancy percentage in the high 80s. As Steve said, we increased occupancy 220 basis points since the beginning of the year. We expect the increase in occupancy to create better revenue growth flow through and incremental margin expansion, ultimately resulting in incremental value for our shareholders. The incremental NOI resulting from ongoing lease-up highlights the value creation of our development and the implicit value of our currently available and buildable capacity. We remain focused on thoughtfully balancing future capacity development with customer opportunities. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have plenty of liquidity and we believe we are well positioned to drive long-term value creation. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: One thing that I really want to address is the cash renewal spreads and how you guys see those moving up. And what I really kind of want to understand is what is functionally happening at the customer level that's allowing CoreSite to push these price increases or kind of negotiate these price increases. I'm just trying to understand your structurally what is happening like in the demand environment and kind of like what the customers -- how they're reacting, how you guys are executing this? Just so we can understand the shift.\nJeff Finnin: Sami, let me just give you maybe something to keep in mind, and then I'll let Steve answer a little bit more color on the actual conversations and a little bit more in tune with what you're asking about. But I just think, in general, when you look at the past several years as a public company our mark-to-market -- our rent growth has historically been somewhere between that 2% to 5%. And last year, we were lower than that and we started out the year expecting it to be a little bit lower and obviously, have been able to execute higher than what we anticipated headed into the year. So overall, I think that that 2% to 5% range is something to think about as we continue to execute on those renewals, but Steve can give you a little bit more color and commentary specific to your question.\nSteve Smith: Yes, I think the 2% to 5% spread is the right thing to focus on. And there are some variables that come into play in any given quarter. Obviously, our goal is to remain market -- make sure that we're in line with what the market supports out there, what customers value and that's what we strive for. What we also strive for is creating unique value for our customers that they're willing to pay for. So it's striking that balance of where we are with our customer, where their history is coming from as far as where they're coming off of their leases, and it's that overall mix that plays into that spread. But I think it's more important to just stay focused on the spread that Jeff mentioned.\nSami Badri: And maybe just customer level conversations. I mean, we started off the year with a much different cash rent growth profile. And I hear you guys on the typical spread. But I think like what I'm really trying to understand is, has something functionally changed in the industry and the supply demand dynamic that enabled this revision and outlook.\nSteve Smith: No, I don't think so. I don't think anything has changed dramatically as far as supply demand or anything like that. I do think that our market and our model, and how we really try to provide more embedded services around interconnection and the stickiness of that helps overall. So as much as we can differentiate our portfolio from others, I think that provides additional value and stickiness and ability to hopefully have that be reflected in the rate. But it's also important for us to maintain that win-win scenario with our customers and make sure that we're being here with the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan: Can you talk to us a little bit about the impacts of inflation, both on how you're looking at current jobs you're bidding for currently and how you've maybe protected yourself on the backlog and so forth, and how you're viewing that over the next 12 or 18 months?\nPaul Szurek: I'll talk about construction and then pass it over to Jeff to cover the rest of the question, Frank, and thanks for it. I mean, I think we're, like all the other data center builders and builders in general that we are expecting increases in prices on future projects. SV9 would probably be the first major one where we would deal with that. All of our current projects were already bought out and we don't see any issues there. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be, because some things are, as Chairman Powell says, transitory and others may not be, but I know that our construction team will work hard to manage those cost increases down. And I expect that all of our peers will be facing the same and that may have some impact on market pricing as well. So there's a lot of variables and we'll just try to manage our way through it as best we can.\nJeff Finnin: And Frank, the only other thing I would add is maybe just three real quick items, in addition to the construction side that Paul alluded to. Obviously, we watch closely on the impact to our cost structure, salaries and related costs and it's something we're continuing to watch. And we obviously work with our HR team and advisers as to what we need to do there. Secondly, customers, we got to be aware of what it does from a customer standpoint. Our typical lease three to four years, it does give us that opportunity to renegotiate where those economics are fairly -- in a fairly near-term basis. So I don't see a significant impact from that perspective. And then third, the other area that we're obviously watching and paying attention to is the extent that we do start seeing that inflation on a consistent basis, what does that do to interest rates and then how does that impact our overall timing associated with our capital needs and plans there.\nPaul Szurek: The only other thing I'd add is that as it relates to the buildings that we've already built, a lot of the inflation risk is taken out as we just need to build out additional floors and computer rooms.\nOperator: Your next question, Nate Crossett with Berenberg.\nNate Crossett: I just wanted to go back to the re-leasing spread question again. I get the 2% to 5% is what you've historically done. But if I'm looking at kind of the expiration schedule over the next few years, it kind of looks like the rates that are expiring are pretty similar to what you've done year to date. So I'm just curious, after this year, what are you kind of thinking for what renewal spreads could look like?\nJeff Finnin: Nate, let me try and address that as best as I can. But I think the best way to think of it is in line with what Steve talked about from an analytical perspective. I think our best data point is how we've been able to execute in the past. The thing that will impact that positively and/or negatively ultimately is the types of customer and leases that we're renewing, i.e. is it more of our retail and scale versus large scale and hyperscale. Those do play some impact. And then the geographical dispersion of where those leases are being renewed, how is the supply and demand look in each of those markets and how hard is it really to lift and shift some of this deployment. So those are other things that enter into and factor into how we're able to execute there. Hard to say where that's going to head here over the next couple of years, but obviously, we'll provide additional details as we get closer to next year.\nNate Crossett: I think in the prepared remarks, there was kind of an allusion to larger deals maybe in the back half. I'm just curious if any of those looking at SV7, what's the update there? And then I think it sounded like there was a move forward of the SV9 after a council meeting. So I'm just wondering what exactly are the next steps for that project?\nSteve Smith: Just to give you some color on SV7. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're excited to see where SV8 has come and reaching 98% occupancy. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, I think it's important to take a look at the campus overall as to how we manage space and try to drive efficient use of that, and maximizing shareholder value throughout the campus. So as we have now filled up really all of SV8, we now turn to the remaining larger spaces that are available, including SV7 and look to populate that with customer demand. So the pipeline still is encouraging in the Santa Clara market. And without saying too much, I think we're well positioned. So that's where I just believe SV7 and I guess as far as SV9 is concerned, Paul, I don't know if you wanted to mention anything that's on SV9?\nPaul Szurek: So we were very glad to receive the unanimous approval of the Santa Clara City Council. And that's probably the biggest step in the process but there are a couple of other steps. We've got to complete the detailed permitting, finalizing the power station plan. But meanwhile, with this zoning entitlement, we can do a lot of pre-construction work that will shorten the put once we start construction. When that start will occur will depend upon market conditions, so i.e., supply and demand in the market, what our absorption rate and funnel looks like in the Santa Clara market, as well as what kind of pre-construction commitments we can achieve to accelerate that. So I can't really predict when we'll start construction, but we'll have a lot more optionality around that with this zoning approval behind us.\nJeff Finnin: Nate, one more thing I should also address with you, specific to your questions on lease spreads, as I'm thinking more about your question. In this quarter, we did sign and renew a power shale customer inside one of our locations. That did bring that rate down, as you know, power shale rates are lower than our typical turnkey. So just so you're aware, as you think about that $1.49 for this quarter, you exclude that one power shale deal, those rates would be much more in line with what we've done over the last several quarters. So just to give you some additional insight there and thinking about for the next couple of years.\nNate Crossett: And just on the deals for the end of the year. Is part of that funnel for kind of immediate take-up of space or could some of that kind of be funneled toward an eventual SV9?\nSteve Smith: Our goal is to maximize the space that we have before we start building new. We obviously don't want to go dark in a market but we've got good runway. And if you look at the historical absorption that we've seen in that market, we typically sold roughly 6 megawatts in a year in Santa Clara and we've got room to run there. So we'll sell the capacity that we have while we work on building SV9.\nOperator: The next question, Jon Atkin with RBC.\nJon Atkin: So I was interested in asking you kind of just more broadly about the inventory -- the start of the year, you talked about 40 megawatts to sell still where are we on that and are you confident just selling -- are you confident of kind of selling the 40 million, I guess? And then as you look across the markets where you've got some substantial capacity, whether it's West Coast, Chicago or Virginia, where do you feel kind of most positive about the supply demand dynamics?\nJeff Finnin: Jon, just to answer your first part of your question, we ended the quarter with 37 megawatts of capacity we can sell into the marketplace. That includes the 4 megawatts that will be vacated here at the end of the third quarter/early fourth quarter from SV7. And when you look at the distribution of those 37 megawatts, it is in large part in our top five markets. So think about the Bay Area, where I think we've got about 12 megawatts. LA, Chicago, New York and Virginia each have somewhere between 4 to 6, just depending on the market.\nSteve Smith: And ironically, as I look to the overall supply demand and overall customer\u2019s requirements in each of those markets, I would say that is a good position to be in, because we've seen good growth in each of those markets, a good opportunity, I would say. As you look at New York, we've seen good growth in the financial sector there and continue to see good momentum there and have good capacity to build additional growth there. Santa Clara between SV7 and SV9, we've got good capacity there and the market continues to support that. We saw good growth out of LA in additional phases there. So I think across the board, we've got good capacity where we built out and where the customer demand is. And overall, I think the supply and demand dynamics remain in balance. So Virginia also remains, I think, a good opportunity for us. So collectively, I think we're in a better position than we have been in the past where we've really had just kind of spotty capacity in certain markets and now we're able to address that in multiple markets, which is a nice place to be.\nJon Atkin: And then as you talked about the sales pipeline, any way to qualitatively give a little bit more color at historically the upper end of the range or record levels, near record levels, or kind of on par with historical levels as you think about late stage sales pipeline?\nSteve Smith: I think the overall size of the pipeline has remained fairly consistent over the last several quarters. I think the quality of the pipeline has actually gotten better. And as you look at our retail and small scale leasing being above the 12 month trail, I think that's a representation of that. And as I already mentioned, I think as we go forward, we look to build on that and then also execute opportunistically around that large-scale and hyperscale opportunity as they present themselves and either contribute value to the ecosystem or value what we bring to them. So we'll play that out as it goes.\nOperator: Next question, Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJordan Sadler: So I just wanted to follow-up. So Jeff, I think on maybe the fourth quarter call, we talked a little bit about commencements and the potential for you guys to be or see something north of $40 million in this year in commencements. So you're sitting at $14 million or so year-to-date. Is that still on the table?\nJeff Finnin: Jordan, I'm not sure if we mentioned commencements or more specific, I think it was just to our sales targets for the year that Steve just alluded to. So I think that's what\u2026\nJordan Sadler: Sales execution, right. Yes.\nSteve Smith: I'll just give you a little comment there, Jordan. I mean, as you look to where we pay so far, I think we're we're pacing towards that. And we expect some lumps as we go through the second half of the year. I think the $40 million is a general target and that can be north of that or slightly less of that depending upon the mix of opportunities and the profitability and the flow through. So as you saw in some of the pricing and the smaller scale and retail sales that have been generated, we'll see how that overall mix plays out. But so far, we're still targeting that $40 million.\nJordan Sadler: And then coming back to the lease spreads in the quarter, obviously, a good number historically when you've seen something unusual you flagged it. But was this plus 4%, plus 7% on the cash and GAAP renewals, was that broad based on the 330 leases or was there a big lease or two that kind of drove the upside?\nPaul Szurek: Jordan, it was fairly dispersed across all of our markets, nothing in which we would point out that was unusually high or low in the market or in the quarter. So overall, it was pretty well dispersed throughout all the renewals we did this quarter.\nJordan Sadler: And then lastly, maybe, Jeff, while I have you, the chiller replacement, I'm trying to better understand this. Is this maintenance CapEx or is it revenue or return generating Capex? And maybe you can walk us through the ROIC math on this chiller plant, total cost versus savings?\nJeff Finnin: No, that investment we made is included in our recurring CapEx dollars. So that overall investment is inside there and some of it is in expansion, just to give you some idea. Since the chiller will facilitate cooling in the entire data center, the portion that replaces current cooling infrastructure is going through maintenance capital, anything for new infrastructure is going through our expansion capital. But we've got about, in total, through several quarters here over the last three quarters, about $15 million going through recurring. Overall investment, I think, was somewhere right around $25 million. And returns are expected, Paul could clarify, but it's somewhere in the mid to upper teens overall once it gets up and running.\nPaul Szurek: And just to add to what Jeff said. When we did this chiller replacement, we actually replaced some chillers that were quite at end of life, but it just made a whole lot more sense to replace them now, build a chiller with tremendously greater economies of scale and efficiency. And it's the energy savings that primarily drives return but it also enables us to better utilize the power throughout the data center, because of the cooling capacity it provides. And on top of everything else, it tremendously strengthens the resiliency of that facility, especially from a cooling perspective because the new chiller plant is dramatically more effective in that regard than what we had before. So I mean these are small projects. I hate to sound overly excited about them but they make a big difference. I love it when we get one of these done.\nOperator: Next question, Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: A couple of questions, first is, if you were to take the bookings and results from the retail and the small scale and look at the revenue that, that creates from rent, power, interconnection. What is that revenue stream growing at within your overall portfolio revenue versus the large and hyperscale? And just a second one, if I could, just with regards to the topic on pricing. Are there any significant leases that you may have or groups of leases at some point down the road where we just need to be mindful that for whatever the reason, those rents got to be significantly above market?\nJeff Finnin: Michael, the answer to your first question, here's probably the best way to think about it. When you look at the rent component of our sales during the quarter, as Steve alluded to, $7.8 million and focus just on those smaller two components, the retail and small scale, on average, our rent makes up about 55% of our overall revenue associated with those deals. So the other 45% is going to be comprised of power, generally around 25% to 30% and then the rest of it is going to be interconnection. The important thing then to understand is the overall economics that flow down to the bottom line, obviously, as we refer to it as RPX, which is rent, power margin and cross connect revenue. And those are the deals where we get better power margins on them, because most of those deals are not on a metered power model. So they are, overall, as Steve alluded to, better economics for us. In terms of overall growth, I have to get back on a specific number but that gives you some idea how to gauge the math around each of those deals. In terms of your other question around leases longer term on pricing, nothing we would highlight today. The only other thing I would add is, as you think about our business, maybe relative to some of our peers, where there's been some concern on some rent roll downs. Keep in mind, our business being much different. We've only got 12 hyperscale leases in the entire portfolio. And that's the area that I think has received most of that commentary out to the marketplace. And it's just a different business model. Obviously, as you saw, we've increased our rent growth guidance for this year, as Steve and his team continue to execute on those lease renewals coming up through the rest of the year. But just keep that in mind as you think about us relative to what else you might be hearing in the industry.\nOperator: Next question, Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.\nErik Rasmussen: It sounds like with SV8 near full capacity, you have a good opportunity to focus on SV7. Can we expect to hear of an update soon regarding sort of backfilling this space? And at this point, are you still expecting to do that with smaller retail leases rather than scale type deals?\nSteve Smith: I mean, overall, that is the space, the larger space that we have to sell on the campus at this point. So it can be anywhere from 6 to 9 megawatts, depending upon the mix and the density. But that is the space that we're selling into today. So you can expect to see some leasing in that space and it will be likely multi-tenant. So that's probably the best color I can give you.\nPaul Szurek: The only thing I'd add, though, is that we haven't in the past said it would be focused on retail. We've said multi-tenant and we do expect some of that to be scale.\nErik Rasmussen: And then maybe just my follow-up. So it's been addressed, the large-scale has been sort of challenged the last couple of quarters. Any hurdles to winning this business, or is it we now at a point where there's enough momentum and it's more of just a timing issue based on some of the sales funnel commentary that you've talked about?\nSteve Smith: It's really more of a timing issue and a fit issue more than anything else. As you look at the trailing two years really around our leasing trend, you pull out the three hyperscale deals that we've done over the past two years and the sales results are actually up, I think, 5% or so. So they are lumpy. Those three deals make the difference in the averages. And we do expect more lumps as we go forward, but the timing of those and how they fit our portfolio, and as I mentioned, bring either more value to our ecosystem or value the ecosystem we've already built that is not -- every hyperscale deal that's out there, so we won't compete on all of them, but the ones that do meet that criteria, we expect to win and they are out there. So we're actively pursuing several of those and we'll see how they play out.\nOperator: Next question, Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColby Synesael: Two questions. One, for Silicon Valley 9, great to see the the local board approval. But one of the things that we've heard of is just there's the power constraints, particularly Silicon Valley power. Is that a real concern for you? Do you think that when you finally get to that point, you will be allocated power or is that potentially a long pole in the tent that could delay the project by a pretty material amount of time, months, if not quarters? And then secondly, you mentioned the word edge a few times. I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more descriptive in terms of what you mean by you're seeing edge deployments and how these might be different than what you've historically seen from these types of customers?\nPaul Szurek: I'll let Steve handle the second part of that question. Colby, good question about power. We've obviously been working with the local utility extensively through the process. We won't start the construction, as you implied, until we have secure power for the facility. Our discussions are going well from what we've seen of their path to providing the power. It looks very reasonable and achievable. The I's need to be dotted and the T's crossed. But so far, the time line for that should not lead to a significant delay. But as you know, in that market you can be surprised.\nSteve Smith: As far as the edge piece is concerned, Colby, as you've heard from us and I think you're seeing broad base across the market. The hybrid multi-cloud edge use cases continue to grow and become more commonplace with enterprises and with them become more demand for close proximity of cloud adjacent types of services. So we're seeing more build out and more demand around that. They may not be hyperscale type of deployments but they are more resident in the campus where customers can gain close access to them and in many cases, on ramps. You may have seen some of the press releases earlier this quarter around GCI having their native deployments, both in Chicago and the Bay Area. And we also had Express Route from Microsoft be delivered in Chicago as well. So having those two on-ramps being native in our Chicago campus, we feel like really bolsters those edge type of deployments and the overall ecosystem there.\nOperator: Next question David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavid Guarino: Going back to the chiller plant project in Boston and I think you did one in LA a couple of years ago. How much of that maintenance CapEx is being driven by CoreSite's desires versus tenants desires? And have you had any conversations with some of your larger customers that are pushing you towards upgrading equipment in order to meet some of their environmental goals?\nPaul Szurek: Honestly, we pushed these two projects and they weren't responsive to customer requests. But if you look at our ESG report on our Web site, you'll see that energy efficiency is one of our big focuses. And I think we stack up pretty well compared to the rest of the industry and what we've achieved and how we've improved over the last few years. There is a lot of customer desire for their vendors to continue to work on improved energy efficiency and other elements of the environmental matrix and we continue to move forward on those, as well as wanting to make sure that facilities are resilient and have the right infrastructure and are operated well. And we continue to -- I think our team does a great job in that respect. And meanwhile, we continue to look for where we need to invest to make it easier for them to do that job.\nDavid Guarino: And do you anticipate a trend, I guess, of maybe customers pushing more towards upgrading data centers? Is that something you guys are thinking about over the next few years?\nPaul Szurek: Honestly, we're not hearing it significantly from most customers, and it's something that we're already doing and focused on anyway. So I don't know that we would feel the pressure as much as others would.\nDavid Guarino: And then maybe just one last one. Following up on those comments you made, I think you might have been -- Jeff on re-leasing rates holding up better for CoreSite's portfolio relative to some of the hyperscale focused portfolios. Is that a similar trend across the entire retail colocation market or is your portfolio just outperforming? And I guess, how do those customer negotiations work? Do they come to the table with some data points and say, here's what market rents are that we see and this is what we want and you guys push back. It would be great to just kind of hear some color on how those negotiations work.\nJeff Finnin: David, I would just say, obviously, we try to watch what our peers are doing in this space, especially those that are more aligned with some of the retail colocation that we offer at the same time, I do think you're -- it's not going to be complete to apples-to-apples, just given the differences in our assets and some of the network dense and kind of the cloud enabled data centers that we have. So it's not going to be completely apples to apple but something we clearly watch. I really can't tell you, at least for the private ones, how they're doing. But we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to get paid for the value that has been built in our differentiating platform. But Steve can give you some additional color on those conversations.\nSteve Smith: As far as the conversations are concerned, it's really customer-by-customer and what their deployment looks like, what their use case is, how long they've been with us, their historical rent role and how that is relative to market. So all of that comes into play in each customer conversation and they're all different. So we manage those accordingly based off of the market dynamics and the customer situation, and that's probably the best, I guess, color I can give you as to how those conversations go.\nOperator: Next question, Richard Choe with JPMorgan.\nRichard Choe: The retail business has been pretty steady but the small-scale business has kind of ramped from under $2 million a quarter to well over that. Can you let us know what's going on there in terms of the strength? And then also, is that return profile any different than the retail, small scale versus retail?\nSteve Smith: It really depends on the deployment. But overall, we kind of lump those into similar buckets, I would say. And it's good to look at those individually. The use cases can be similar. So most of our leasing, as I mentioned earlier, especially the new leasing was around enterprise sales and that's the primary focus of the team is driving new logos in that are enterprise and that are contributing or valuing the ecosystem. So I don't know if there's any radical trends there other than you're seeing, I think, more enterprises kind of go towards that hybrid multi-cloud environment where they establish their own footprint in our data center and then leverage cloud on-ramps in order to kind of build out that overall cloud architecture. So I don't think there's any massive shift there other than just -- we're executing better against the enterprise. And I think the enterprise is continuing to kind of rationalize that cloud versus on-prem model.\nRichard Choe: And it seems like overall strength has been pretty good, if not better than expected. Does that kind of -- I know churn guidance hasn't changed, but it seems like that might put less pressure on churn overall. Any comments there?\nSteve Smith: No, I don't think so. Our guidance is our guidance because it's the best estimate that we have. So we'll continue to monitor it. And as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to sell unique value that customers want to come and stay. And once they do build out their architecture, it is a bit more complex than a single network connection that makes it easier to leave. So if we can provide more value that makes them want to stay longer then hopefully, that reduces the churn risk long term, but we'll see how that plays out.\nOperator: The next question, Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: It sounded like you had about 26 new logos in the quarter and six with multi metro deployments. If you can just put this in the context of what has been your traditional historical run rate?\nSteve Smith: As far as the number of logos at 26, it's a little bit lower than the trail. Typically, we're in the roughly 30-ish range is probably the best way to think of the numbers. But if you look at the dollars that are contributing from those logos, it's actually one of our higher quarters in terms of true dollars. So the size has come up a bit. I think the quality has come up a bit. The actual numbers was a little lower but not outside the trail.\nBrendan Lynch: I think some of your peers have suggested that they're starting to see more new logos kind of emerging post pandemic. Is that something you're seeing as well that these customers have kind of been on the sidelines, but they're coming back more aggressively at this point?\nSteve Smith: Overall, the pipeline is strong, as I mentioned earlier. It's been strong for the last year and half, I would say, as we entered the pandemic, it really highlighted those enterprises that were challenged with distributed work, how they manage their supply chain, how they sell remotely. So it's been at the forefront for a lot of enterprises. And now that they're kind of coming out of it, we'll see how the latest dynamics play out. But they're really trying to figure out how they rationalize that for their long-term strategy. And all of the trends that we see, the analysts that we talk to, point towards this hybrid multi-cloud environment, which we think we're well positioned for. So yes, we're encouraged with where things are headed.\nOperator: Next question, Nick del Deo with MoffetNathanson.\nNick del Deo: I guess, first, there's obviously been a lot of noise regarding new regulations on Chinese tech companies and the kind of general friction between the US and China. I was wondering if you could update us on your exposure to to China based companies, whether they've contributed all to leasing in recent periods? And whether you've observed any shift in tone or commentary regarding their intentions to remain in the US or exit the market?\nPaul Szurek: Obviously, there has been some noise and we watch it closely as well. I would just point you to some information we had put into one of our investor presentations in early 2020. I want to say maybe second quarter 2020. Kate's shaking her head. So I think that's it. Whereby we quantified what that exposure is from some of our Chinese or I should say, our customers domiciled in China and that was 7% at that time. It has not materially changed from that point in time. Obviously, something we continue to watch closely.\nNick del Deo: Any qualitative commentary regarding how customer intentions may have changed since then or nothing to update on?\nSteve Smith: Nick, I would say that as far as overall demand is concerned, I think that has a bit muted over the last year, I would say, maybe a bit longer. Some of that gets absorbed by other partners that we have that also support that market. So collectively, that helps us in that regard. But I think some of the larger players, the hyperscale providers, that's not really the market that we played in, in many cases anyway. So I think we're a bit removed from direct impact of what that might be anyway.\nNick del Deo: And then, Steve, maybe to follow-up on one comment you made earlier in the call. You noted that the quality of your scale funnel, you thought had improved over time, even though the size was roughly the same. How do you define quality? Is it the quality of the customers? Is it their potential contribution to your ecosystem, is it the likelihood of the deal closing or some other measure?\nSteve Smith: I think it's all of that. I think you summed it up well. I mean there's a lot of larger opportunities and frankly, even smaller opportunities that just are not a good fit that are looking for the lowest cost provider out there with a network connection. And we're probably not a great fit for them. For those customers that are looking for high resiliency, high performance, interconnection, to multi-cloud types of architectures and multi markets that they can connect to, were a better fit for us. So that does not hold true for every single opportunity that's out there. But those that do value us, that's what we're really striving for. So I think our messaging is better on how we attract those. Our funnel is, I think, cleaner and better quality. And you're seeing some of that show up, I think. So we'll see how it all plays out but we're encouraged by it so far.\nOperator: Next question, Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: First, on interconnection, I think last year, maybe third quarter, you mentioned that you thought maybe some demand got pulled forward into 2020 and we did see a sequential deceleration in the rate of growth there this quarter. Is that part of what you're seeing? And if not, do you expect that growth rate to pick back up exiting 2021?\nJeff Finnin: Michael, I think as we came into 2021 what we anticipated, I should say, what we've seen historically is roughly two thirds of that. Revenue growth was really just coming from pure increase in volumes but the other third increases in rates around renewals, people migrating from a lower priced product to a higher priced product, et cetera. We felt as though that second portion, that one third contribution would be more muted this year as we headed into 2021 just given some of the activity we've seen over the last couple of years. I think it has trended towards that direction, probably not as quickly as we anticipated. And so we're still getting about 85% of our revenue growth coming from pure increase in volumes. The other roughly 15% is coming from those customers who are migrating to higher priced products as they expand their business or price increases on renewals with some of our customers, et cetera. I don't think about going forward [Multiple Speakers] your second part of your question, as you think about going forward. I don't know how that plays out for 2022 yet. We're still evaluating what that looks like based on behavior of the rest of the year and the types of deployments we have. But we'll give some further clarification on it as we get a little bit closer.\nMichael Funk: And then on churn, the churn dynamics. Are you seeing different drivers of customer churn today versus a couple of years ago? Meaning either more customers remain in your facility but handing back some space or more customers that are fully vacating. Has there been a shift in the driver of churn or is that pretty consistent with where it has been historically?\nJeff Finnin: The only thing I would add and maybe comment on, and we may have talked about this earlier, is that a couple of years ago we just saw some of that elevated churn resulting from those business models that we felt were a little bit more compromised from the cloud than others. And that is largely left our portfolio at this point. I think we got about 1% out. And what I'm talking about are some of those resellers and managed service providers, many of which we used to have in our portfolio. That's the only thing I would point to in terms of changing. I don't think the behavior themselves have changed. Customers are always looking to either grow or maybe shrink their portfolio based on what's going on with their individual applications. But I think that's been going on for years. I don't think that, that dynamic has changed, unless Steve has anything else to add there.\nSteve Smith: No, I don't think so either. And I think we've often been asked, I think, less often now. Is cloud friend or foe? And I think the the answer at this point is yes. But overall, I would say it's friend. And as you look at just the overall adoption of technology across any business that technology ends up in a data center somewhere, even those resellers or cloud providers, they end up in a data center and many times our data center. So the use cases may change, how they deploy them may change but the overall pie continues to grow. And so we think we're well positioned to capture that.\nOperator: Thank you. I will turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead.\nPaul Szurek: Well, thank you all for your time and your interest in CoreSite. We're really glad for this quarter and we're looking forward to the future. Our business is built on the concept that in our data centers, enterprises doing hybrid and multi-cloud architectures can realize significant performance and agility improvements and overall cost savings by taking advantage of our campus ecosystems, as well as the fact that our network dense data centers provide a tremendous location for servicing the customers in our major edge markets. I'm really grateful for the colleagues that I work with, that we all work with. They do a tremendous job and they're the reason that we're able to continue to perform, and I expect them to enable us to continue to perform well going forward. So thank you very much, and have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Paul Szurek",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover the quarter's highlights, and Steve and Jeff will discuss sales and financial results in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, including operating revenues of $162 million, resulting in 7.7% year-over-year growth and FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42, which is year-over-year growth of 5.2%, excluding the impact of a onetime benefit of $0.06 per share that Jeff will discuss later. Second quarter sales results included new and expansion leases of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which consisted of $7 million of retail colocation and small scale leasing, above the trailing 12 month average and $0.8 million of large-scale leasing. We are pleased with our retail and small-scale leasing so far this year. And as Steve will discuss, we expect more volume in large-scale leases in future months as the funnel of these longer cycle opportunities should bear fruit. Our sales trends confirm the findings in the 2021 state of the Data Center Survey that International Data Group recently published, which shows colocation emerging as a key element for modern IT enterprises, bridging multiple cloud and service providers to provide a robust foundation for driving innovation. The full survey is available on our Web site. Turning to our property development. The LA3 Phase 2 construction project remains on track for Q4 2021 delivery, and we completed a pre-lease for a scale deployment this quarter to an existing customer. We also achieved a lease percentage of 89% at LA3 Phase 1, reflecting the strength of our position in the Los Angeles market and solid sales activity. In addition, we placed a new 4-megawatt computer room at NY2 under development with an estimated Q1 2022 delivery date. We continue to see strong demand in the New York market, particularly in the financial services industry. The new Boston chiller plant project has been completed. We expect the chiller to provide a positive return on investment through improved power efficiency and utilization. As you know from our 2020 sustainability report, energy efficiency is a key focus for CoreSite. And finally, we received zoning approval from the Santa Clara City Council for our SV9 development, an important entitlement, and we continue to work through the remaining pre-construction activities to bring SV9 to a shovel ready state. We achieved a valuable milestone at our SV8 data center, which reached stabilization during the quarter at 98% occupancy, less than two years from the delivery of Phase 1 with financial returns expected to achieve our underwriting with some additional time and maturation. On the connectivity front, we recently announced on-net availability to Google Cloud natively on our Chicago and Silicon Valley campuses, further supporting Google's partner interconnect and validating the importance attributed to our portfolio by key cloud partners. In summary, we have solid accomplishments for the first half of the year, and Jeff will discuss their positive impact on guidance. We are executing well on our 2021 goals to translate our new and vacant capacity into sales opportunities to attract high quality logos that value our campus ecosystems, to expand our connectivity options and relationships to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and to return to mid to high single digit growth in revenues, earnings and FFO per share. We remain optimistic about the fundamental market drivers supporting our go-to-market strategy, technology requiring low latency, high performance, hybrid cloud IT architectures continue to play an increasingly important role in the success of businesses. And CoreSite is well positioned to capture an attractive share of the edge needs in our major metropolitan markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. I'll talk about construction and then pass it over to Jeff to cover the rest of the question, Frank, and thanks for it. I mean, I think we're, like all the other data center builders and builders in general that we are expecting increases in prices on future projects. SV9 would probably be the first major one where we would deal with that. All of our current projects were already bought out and we don't see any issues there. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be, because some things are, as Chairman Powell says, transitory and others may not be, but I know that our construction team will work hard to manage those cost increases down. And I expect that all of our peers will be facing the same and that may have some impact on market pricing as well. So there's a lot of variables and we'll just try to manage our way through it as best we can. The only other thing I'd add is that as it relates to the buildings that we've already built, a lot of the inflation risk is taken out as we just need to build out additional floors and computer rooms. So we were very glad to receive the unanimous approval of the Santa Clara City Council. And that's probably the biggest step in the process but there are a couple of other steps. We've got to complete the detailed permitting, finalizing the power station plan. But meanwhile, with this zoning entitlement, we can do a lot of pre-construction work that will shorten the put once we start construction. When that start will occur will depend upon market conditions, so i.e., supply and demand in the market, what our absorption rate and funnel looks like in the Santa Clara market, as well as what kind of pre-construction commitments we can achieve to accelerate that. So I can't really predict when we'll start construction, but we'll have a lot more optionality around that with this zoning approval behind us. Jordan, it was fairly dispersed across all of our markets, nothing in which we would point out that was unusually high or low in the market or in the quarter. So overall, it was pretty well dispersed throughout all the renewals we did this quarter. And just to add to what Jeff said. When we did this chiller replacement, we actually replaced some chillers that were quite at end of life, but it just made a whole lot more sense to replace them now, build a chiller with tremendously greater economies of scale and efficiency. And it's the energy savings that primarily drives return but it also enables us to better utilize the power throughout the data center, because of the cooling capacity it provides. And on top of everything else, it tremendously strengthens the resiliency of that facility, especially from a cooling perspective because the new chiller plant is dramatically more effective in that regard than what we had before. So I mean these are small projects. I hate to sound overly excited about them but they make a big difference. I love it when we get one of these done. The only thing I'd add, though, is that we haven't in the past said it would be focused on retail. We've said multi-tenant and we do expect some of that to be scale. I'll let Steve handle the second part of that question. Colby, good question about power. We've obviously been working with the local utility extensively through the process. We won't start the construction, as you implied, until we have secure power for the facility. Our discussions are going well from what we've seen of their path to providing the power. It looks very reasonable and achievable. The I's need to be dotted and the T's crossed. But so far, the time line for that should not lead to a significant delay. But as you know, in that market you can be surprised. Honestly, we pushed these two projects and they weren't responsive to customer requests. But if you look at our ESG report on our Web site, you'll see that energy efficiency is one of our big focuses. And I think we stack up pretty well compared to the rest of the industry and what we've achieved and how we've improved over the last few years. There is a lot of customer desire for their vendors to continue to work on improved energy efficiency and other elements of the environmental matrix and we continue to move forward on those, as well as wanting to make sure that facilities are resilient and have the right infrastructure and are operated well. And we continue to -- I think our team does a great job in that respect. And meanwhile, we continue to look for where we need to invest to make it easier for them to do that job. Honestly, we're not hearing it significantly from most customers, and it's something that we're already doing and focused on anyway. So I don't know that we would feel the pressure as much as others would. Obviously, there has been some noise and we watch it closely as well. I would just point you to some information we had put into one of our investor presentations in early 2020. I want to say maybe second quarter 2020. Kate's shaking her head. So I think that's it.

As Paul mentioned, we delivered new and expansion sales of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, which included $3.4 million annualized GAAP rent from retail colocation leases and $4.4 million of GAAP rent from scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 33,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $235 per square foot, as well as 26 new logos that were added to our customer ecosystem with opportunities for future growth. I will highlight a few specific use cases from these new logos in a moment. New and expansion pricing on a kilowatt basis this quarter was above the trailing 12 month average by low to mid-teens, reflecting the unique use cases and mix of both size and location of leases signed this quarter. Contributing to this, our new and expansion sales of retail and small scale leasing was also above the trailing 12 month average. These leasing categories are a primary focus as they often represent performance sensitive applications requiring high interoperability and hybrid cloud architectures. These deployments also typically drive incremental power margin in interconnection revenues, improving profitability while enhancing the ecosystem. To supplement the retail and small scale sales results, our team is working hard to deliver more value add, large scale and hyperscale leasing throughout the second half of 2021, although, actual timing can be affected by the complexities and longer sales cycles of these larger deployments. Consistent with our strategy, we saw strong organic growth and demand from existing customers, who accounted for 86% of annualized GAAP rents signed during the second quarter as their digital architectures evolved and expand. Noteworthy expansions from existing customers included scaled edge deployments from a digital content customer and a public cloud customer expanding their footprints in the Los Angeles market to support their growing customer demand; a scaled expansion from a higher education customer in the New York market leading to support its high performance research computing; and scaled expansions from a financial derivatives exchange and a global investment management firm, enhancing our high quality financial services ecosystem in the New York market. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets for new and expansion leases in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed were Los Angeles, New York and Northern Virginia, which combined represented 75% of our annualized GAAP rent signed during the quarter. Turning to notable new customer wins. The 26 new logos signed represents $1.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 14% of our sales during the quarter, including six new customers executing multi-market contracts. We effectively competed for and won 15 separate deployments across multiple markets from these six customers as they looked to solve for their distributed technical requirements, including high interoperability, robust security and enhanced reliability. Attracting high-quality new logos looking for this type of interoperability further strengthens the flywheel effect of our densely interconnected campus model and portfolio ecosystem. Enterprises contributed 93% of new logo annualized GAAP rents signed during this quarter and included an investment management firm join our rising financial services ecosystem in the New York market and another prominent law firm, known for its strategic work for major enterprises deploying in both New York and the Northern Virginia markets. Finally, we ended the second quarter at 84.1% of total data center occupancy, increasing our occupancy by 220 basis points since the beginning of the year and furthering our progress towards our targeted goal in the high 80s range. As we look to the second half of 2021, we are well positioned to capture the demand for edge use cases with high performance, hybrid and multi-cloud IT requirements, which we expect to drive significant value to the lease-up of our available capacity. We are working on attractive large scale and selective hyperscale opportunities that align with our campus value and shareholder objectives, and we remain optimistic about the sales funnel for the second half of 2021. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Yes, I think the 2% to 5% spread is the right thing to focus on. And there are some variables that come into play in any given quarter. Obviously, our goal is to remain market -- make sure that we're in line with what the market supports out there, what customers value and that's what we strive for. What we also strive for is creating unique value for our customers that they're willing to pay for. So it's striking that balance of where we are with our customer, where their history is coming from as far as where they're coming off of their leases, and it's that overall mix that plays into that spread. But I think it's more important to just stay focused on the spread that Jeff mentioned. No, I don't think so. I don't think anything has changed dramatically as far as supply demand or anything like that. I do think that our market and our model, and how we really try to provide more embedded services around interconnection and the stickiness of that helps overall. So as much as we can differentiate our portfolio from others, I think that provides additional value and stickiness and ability to hopefully have that be reflected in the rate. But it's also important for us to maintain that win-win scenario with our customers and make sure that we're being here with the market. Just to give you some color on SV7. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're excited to see where SV8 has come and reaching 98% occupancy. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, I think it's important to take a look at the campus overall as to how we manage space and try to drive efficient use of that, and maximizing shareholder value throughout the campus. So as we have now filled up really all of SV8, we now turn to the remaining larger spaces that are available, including SV7 and look to populate that with customer demand. So the pipeline still is encouraging in the Santa Clara market. And without saying too much, I think we're well positioned. So that's where I just believe SV7 and I guess as far as SV9 is concerned, Paul, I don't know if you wanted to mention anything that's on SV9? Our goal is to maximize the space that we have before we start building new. We obviously don't want to go dark in a market but we've got good runway. And if you look at the historical absorption that we've seen in that market, we typically sold roughly 6 megawatts in a year in Santa Clara and we've got room to run there. So we'll sell the capacity that we have while we work on building SV9. And ironically, as I look to the overall supply demand and overall customer\u2019s requirements in each of those markets, I would say that is a good position to be in, because we've seen good growth in each of those markets, a good opportunity, I would say. As you look at New York, we've seen good growth in the financial sector there and continue to see good momentum there and have good capacity to build additional growth there. Santa Clara between SV7 and SV9, we've got good capacity there and the market continues to support that. We saw good growth out of LA in additional phases there. So I think across the board, we've got good capacity where we built out and where the customer demand is. And overall, I think the supply and demand dynamics remain in balance. So Virginia also remains, I think, a good opportunity for us. So collectively, I think we're in a better position than we have been in the past where we've really had just kind of spotty capacity in certain markets and now we're able to address that in multiple markets, which is a nice place to be. I think the overall size of the pipeline has remained fairly consistent over the last several quarters. I think the quality of the pipeline has actually gotten better. And as you look at our retail and small scale leasing being above the 12 month trail, I think that's a representation of that. And as I already mentioned, I think as we go forward, we look to build on that and then also execute opportunistically around that large-scale and hyperscale opportunity as they present themselves and either contribute value to the ecosystem or value what we bring to them. So we'll play that out as it goes. I'll just give you a little comment there, Jordan. I mean, as you look to where we pay so far, I think we're we're pacing towards that. And we expect some lumps as we go through the second half of the year. I think the $40 million is a general target and that can be north of that or slightly less of that depending upon the mix of opportunities and the profitability and the flow through. So as you saw in some of the pricing and the smaller scale and retail sales that have been generated, we'll see how that overall mix plays out. But so far, we're still targeting that $40 million. I mean, overall, that is the space, the larger space that we have to sell on the campus at this point. So it can be anywhere from 6 to 9 megawatts, depending upon the mix and the density. But that is the space that we're selling into today. So you can expect to see some leasing in that space and it will be likely multi-tenant. So that's probably the best color I can give you. It's really more of a timing issue and a fit issue more than anything else. As you look at the trailing two years really around our leasing trend, you pull out the three hyperscale deals that we've done over the past two years and the sales results are actually up, I think, 5% or so. So they are lumpy. Those three deals make the difference in the averages. And we do expect more lumps as we go forward, but the timing of those and how they fit our portfolio, and as I mentioned, bring either more value to our ecosystem or value the ecosystem we've already built that is not -- every hyperscale deal that's out there, so we won't compete on all of them, but the ones that do meet that criteria, we expect to win and they are out there. So we're actively pursuing several of those and we'll see how they play out. As far as the edge piece is concerned, Colby, as you've heard from us and I think you're seeing broad base across the market. The hybrid multi-cloud edge use cases continue to grow and become more commonplace with enterprises and with them become more demand for close proximity of cloud adjacent types of services. So we're seeing more build out and more demand around that. They may not be hyperscale type of deployments but they are more resident in the campus where customers can gain close access to them and in many cases, on ramps. You may have seen some of the press releases earlier this quarter around GCI having their native deployments, both in Chicago and the Bay Area. And we also had Express Route from Microsoft be delivered in Chicago as well. So having those two on-ramps being native in our Chicago campus, we feel like really bolsters those edge type of deployments and the overall ecosystem there. As far as the conversations are concerned, it's really customer-by-customer and what their deployment looks like, what their use case is, how long they've been with us, their historical rent role and how that is relative to market. So all of that comes into play in each customer conversation and they're all different. So we manage those accordingly based off of the market dynamics and the customer situation, and that's probably the best, I guess, color I can give you as to how those conversations go. It really depends on the deployment. But overall, we kind of lump those into similar buckets, I would say. And it's good to look at those individually. The use cases can be similar. So most of our leasing, as I mentioned earlier, especially the new leasing was around enterprise sales and that's the primary focus of the team is driving new logos in that are enterprise and that are contributing or valuing the ecosystem. So I don't know if there's any radical trends there other than you're seeing, I think, more enterprises kind of go towards that hybrid multi-cloud environment where they establish their own footprint in our data center and then leverage cloud on-ramps in order to kind of build out that overall cloud architecture. So I don't think there's any massive shift there other than just -- we're executing better against the enterprise. And I think the enterprise is continuing to kind of rationalize that cloud versus on-prem model. No, I don't think so. Our guidance is our guidance because it's the best estimate that we have. So we'll continue to monitor it. And as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to sell unique value that customers want to come and stay. And once they do build out their architecture, it is a bit more complex than a single network connection that makes it easier to leave. So if we can provide more value that makes them want to stay longer then hopefully, that reduces the churn risk long term, but we'll see how that plays out. As far as the number of logos at 26, it's a little bit lower than the trail. Typically, we're in the roughly 30-ish range is probably the best way to think of the numbers. But if you look at the dollars that are contributing from those logos, it's actually one of our higher quarters in terms of true dollars. So the size has come up a bit. I think the quality has come up a bit. The actual numbers was a little lower but not outside the trail. Overall, the pipeline is strong, as I mentioned earlier. It's been strong for the last year and half, I would say, as we entered the pandemic, it really highlighted those enterprises that were challenged with distributed work, how they manage their supply chain, how they sell remotely. So it's been at the forefront for a lot of enterprises. And now that they're kind of coming out of it, we'll see how the latest dynamics play out. But they're really trying to figure out how they rationalize that for their long-term strategy. And all of the trends that we see, the analysts that we talk to, point towards this hybrid multi-cloud environment, which we think we're well positioned for. So yes, we're encouraged with where things are headed. Nick, I would say that as far as overall demand is concerned, I think that has a bit muted over the last year, I would say, maybe a bit longer. Some of that gets absorbed by other partners that we have that also support that market. So collectively, that helps us in that regard. But I think some of the larger players, the hyperscale providers, that's not really the market that we played in, in many cases anyway. So I think we're a bit removed from direct impact of what that might be anyway. I think it's all of that. I think you summed it up well. I mean there's a lot of larger opportunities and frankly, even smaller opportunities that just are not a good fit that are looking for the lowest cost provider out there with a network connection. And we're probably not a great fit for them. For those customers that are looking for high resiliency, high performance, interconnection, to multi-cloud types of architectures and multi markets that they can connect to, were a better fit for us. So that does not hold true for every single opportunity that's out there. But those that do value us, that's what we're really striving for. So I think our messaging is better on how we attract those. Our funnel is, I think, cleaner and better quality. And you're seeing some of that show up, I think. So we'll see how it all plays out but we're encouraged by it so far. No, I don't think so either. And I think we've often been asked, I think, less often now. Is cloud friend or foe? And I think the the answer at this point is yes. But overall, I would say it's friend. And as you look at just the overall adoption of technology across any business that technology ends up in a data center somewhere, even those resellers or cloud providers, they end up in a data center and many times our data center. So the use cases may change, how they deploy them may change but the overall pie continues to grow. And so we think we're well positioned to capture that."

            "name": "Jeff Finnin",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our second quarter financial results, balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, and then review our financial outlook and updated 2021 guidance. We achieved another strong quarter of financial results. Operating revenues were $162.1 million, an increase of 7.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date through Q2, the three components of data center revenues, rents, power and interconnection revenues, increased year-over-year at 6%, 10% and 9% respectively. As a reminder, our reported new and expansion sales results only include the rental revenue component of the new leases. Lease renewals equaling $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent were finalized during the quarter, resulting in cash rent mark-to-market of 4.2% and GAAP mark-to-market of 7.1%. Year-to-date, our cash rent mark-to-market equals 3.4%, exceeding our initial guidance range. We also incurred churn of 1.3% for the quarter within our more normal historical range as we expected. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $8.4 million of annualized GAAP rent, revenue backlog consisting of $8.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or $15.6 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. The difference between the GAAP and cash backlog is primarily driven by a handful of scale leases with power ramps in the early portion of their lease terms. We expect approximately 70% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the third quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence during the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.1% year-over-year. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 8.2%, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, also an improvement over the guidance provided at the beginning of the year. Net income was $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year and $0.08 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.48. I recommend you look at the FFO per share results on an adjusted basis of $1.42 per share, which removes the impact of a onetime benefit of $3.1 million or $0.06 per share, resulting from the release of a tax liability that we no longer expect to be incurred. FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42 is an increase of $0.07 or 5.2% year-over-year. Year-to-date, FFO per share as adjusted increased 6.8%. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA decreased to 5 times as of June 30th. We saw organic deleveraging again this quarter as we continue to lease the capacity we developed over the last few years and realize the corresponding adjusted EBITDA growth. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.9 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $264.3 million of liquidity and therefore, the capital to fully fund our 2021 business plan. Turning to 2021 guidance. We are increasing our guidance related to net income attributable to common diluted shares to our new range of $1.99 to $2.07 per share. In addition, our guidance related to 2021 FFO per share as adjusted has been increased from our previous range of $5.42 to $5.52 per share to our new guidance range of $5.52 to $5.6 per share. The increase of $0.09 at the midpoint or approximately 1.6% is largely driven by an increase in operating revenues, improved adjusted EBITDA margins and to a lesser extent by lower than anticipated interest expense. We also increased our cash rent mark-to-market guidance to a range of 2% to 4% from our previous range of 0% to 2%. Other than the changes noted here and those on Page 21 of our supplemental, our 2021 guidance and related drivers remain unchanged. A few items to keep in mind related to our capital expenditures guidance. A portion of expansion capital spend in the second half of 2021 is dependent on the timing of our development at SV9, which could push into 2022, resulting in lower than anticipated capital spend this year. And with the completion of our investments in the SV1 office floor build-out and the Boston cooling infrastructure, both of which are expected to generate attractive returns on investment, our recurring CapEx will decrease and return to more normal levels in the second half of this year. And therefore, increase our AFFO to FFO ratio prospectively. In closing, as we move into the second half of 2021, we will continue to focus on our goal to lease-up our available capacity to achieve a portfolio occupancy percentage in the high 80s. As Steve said, we increased occupancy 220 basis points since the beginning of the year. We expect the increase in occupancy to create better revenue growth flow through and incremental margin expansion, ultimately resulting in incremental value for our shareholders. The incremental NOI resulting from ongoing lease-up highlights the value creation of our development and the implicit value of our currently available and buildable capacity. We remain focused on thoughtfully balancing future capacity development with customer opportunities. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have plenty of liquidity and we believe we are well positioned to drive long-term value creation. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Sami, let me just give you maybe something to keep in mind, and then I'll let Steve answer a little bit more color on the actual conversations and a little bit more in tune with what you're asking about. But I just think, in general, when you look at the past several years as a public company our mark-to-market -- our rent growth has historically been somewhere between that 2% to 5%. And last year, we were lower than that and we started out the year expecting it to be a little bit lower and obviously, have been able to execute higher than what we anticipated headed into the year. So overall, I think that that 2% to 5% range is something to think about as we continue to execute on those renewals, but Steve can give you a little bit more color and commentary specific to your question. And Frank, the only other thing I would add is maybe just three real quick items, in addition to the construction side that Paul alluded to. Obviously, we watch closely on the impact to our cost structure, salaries and related costs and it's something we're continuing to watch. And we obviously work with our HR team and advisers as to what we need to do there. Secondly, customers, we got to be aware of what it does from a customer standpoint. Our typical lease three to four years, it does give us that opportunity to renegotiate where those economics are fairly -- in a fairly near-term basis. So I don't see a significant impact from that perspective. And then third, the other area that we're obviously watching and paying attention to is the extent that we do start seeing that inflation on a consistent basis, what does that do to interest rates and then how does that impact our overall timing associated with our capital needs and plans there. Nate, let me try and address that as best as I can. But I think the best way to think of it is in line with what Steve talked about from an analytical perspective. I think our best data point is how we've been able to execute in the past. The thing that will impact that positively and/or negatively ultimately is the types of customer and leases that we're renewing, i.e. is it more of our retail and scale versus large scale and hyperscale. Those do play some impact. And then the geographical dispersion of where those leases are being renewed, how is the supply and demand look in each of those markets and how hard is it really to lift and shift some of this deployment. So those are other things that enter into and factor into how we're able to execute there. Hard to say where that's going to head here over the next couple of years, but obviously, we'll provide additional details as we get closer to next year. Nate, one more thing I should also address with you, specific to your questions on lease spreads, as I'm thinking more about your question. In this quarter, we did sign and renew a power shale customer inside one of our locations. That did bring that rate down, as you know, power shale rates are lower than our typical turnkey. So just so you're aware, as you think about that $1.49 for this quarter, you exclude that one power shale deal, those rates would be much more in line with what we've done over the last several quarters. So just to give you some additional insight there and thinking about for the next couple of years. Jon, just to answer your first part of your question, we ended the quarter with 37 megawatts of capacity we can sell into the marketplace. That includes the 4 megawatts that will be vacated here at the end of the third quarter/early fourth quarter from SV7. And when you look at the distribution of those 37 megawatts, it is in large part in our top five markets. So think about the Bay Area, where I think we've got about 12 megawatts. LA, Chicago, New York and Virginia each have somewhere between 4 to 6, just depending on the market. Jordan, I'm not sure if we mentioned commencements or more specific, I think it was just to our sales targets for the year that Steve just alluded to. So I think that's what\u2026 No, that investment we made is included in our recurring CapEx dollars. So that overall investment is inside there and some of it is in expansion, just to give you some idea. Since the chiller will facilitate cooling in the entire data center, the portion that replaces current cooling infrastructure is going through maintenance capital, anything for new infrastructure is going through our expansion capital. But we've got about, in total, through several quarters here over the last three quarters, about $15 million going through recurring. Overall investment, I think, was somewhere right around $25 million. And returns are expected, Paul could clarify, but it's somewhere in the mid to upper teens overall once it gets up and running. Michael, the answer to your first question, here's probably the best way to think about it. When you look at the rent component of our sales during the quarter, as Steve alluded to, $7.8 million and focus just on those smaller two components, the retail and small scale, on average, our rent makes up about 55% of our overall revenue associated with those deals. So the other 45% is going to be comprised of power, generally around 25% to 30% and then the rest of it is going to be interconnection. The important thing then to understand is the overall economics that flow down to the bottom line, obviously, as we refer to it as RPX, which is rent, power margin and cross connect revenue. And those are the deals where we get better power margins on them, because most of those deals are not on a metered power model. So they are, overall, as Steve alluded to, better economics for us. In terms of overall growth, I have to get back on a specific number but that gives you some idea how to gauge the math around each of those deals. In terms of your other question around leases longer term on pricing, nothing we would highlight today. The only other thing I would add is, as you think about our business, maybe relative to some of our peers, where there's been some concern on some rent roll downs. Keep in mind, our business being much different. We've only got 12 hyperscale leases in the entire portfolio. And that's the area that I think has received most of that commentary out to the marketplace. And it's just a different business model. Obviously, as you saw, we've increased our rent growth guidance for this year, as Steve and his team continue to execute on those lease renewals coming up through the rest of the year. But just keep that in mind as you think about us relative to what else you might be hearing in the industry. David, I would just say, obviously, we try to watch what our peers are doing in this space, especially those that are more aligned with some of the retail colocation that we offer at the same time, I do think you're -- it's not going to be complete to apples-to-apples, just given the differences in our assets and some of the network dense and kind of the cloud enabled data centers that we have. So it's not going to be completely apples to apple but something we clearly watch. I really can't tell you, at least for the private ones, how they're doing. But we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to get paid for the value that has been built in our differentiating platform. But Steve can give you some additional color on those conversations. Michael, I think as we came into 2021 what we anticipated, I should say, what we've seen historically is roughly two thirds of that. Revenue growth was really just coming from pure increase in volumes but the other third increases in rates around renewals, people migrating from a lower priced product to a higher priced product, et cetera. We felt as though that second portion, that one third contribution would be more muted this year as we headed into 2021 just given some of the activity we've seen over the last couple of years. I think it has trended towards that direction, probably not as quickly as we anticipated. And so we're still getting about 85% of our revenue growth coming from pure increase in volumes. The other roughly 15% is coming from those customers who are migrating to higher priced products as they expand their business or price increases on renewals with some of our customers, et cetera. I don't think about going forward [Multiple Speakers] your second part of your question, as you think about going forward. I don't know how that plays out for 2022 yet. We're still evaluating what that looks like based on behavior of the rest of the year and the types of deployments we have. But we'll give some further clarification on it as we get a little bit closer. The only thing I would add and maybe comment on, and we may have talked about this earlier, is that a couple of years ago we just saw some of that elevated churn resulting from those business models that we felt were a little bit more compromised from the cloud than others. And that is largely left our portfolio at this point. I think we got about 1% out. And what I'm talking about are some of those resellers and managed service providers, many of which we used to have in our portfolio. That's the only thing I would point to in terms of changing. I don't think the behavior themselves have changed. Customers are always looking to either grow or maybe shrink their portfolio based on what's going on with their individual applications. But I think that's been going on for years. I don't think that, that dynamic has changed, unless Steve has anything else to add there."

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press 110. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nIgor Khislavsky: Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We\u2019ve posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning\u2019s call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO will provide a strategic update on our U.S. business, and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer will discuss our Q1 2021 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2021 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, our expectations regarding our pending Telxius acquisition, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning\u2019s earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks Igor. Good morning everyone.  As is typical in our first quarter call, the focus of my comments today will be on our foundational U.S. business, which represented nearly 58% of our total property revenue and more than two thirds of our consolidated property segment operating profit in Q1 while accounting for about three quarters of our $60 billion in contractually committed revenue. The overall NOI yield of our U.S. property segment now stands at 11.5% [indiscernible] the portfolio for at least 10 years, generating more than 20%. These metrics reflect our long track record of driving strong, profitable, recurring cash flow growth in the U.S., and we remain confident in our ability to extend that track record long into the future. This confidence is inspired not only by the exceptional visibility we have into our long-term organic growth rate through our existing comprehensive master lease agreement, but also due to a number of favorable industry trends that we expect to drive our business forward. These trends in large part center on our customers\u2019 5G network deployments, which we expect to meaningfully accelerate over the next several years giving rise to a more developed 5G world. On the demand side of the equation, mobile data usage growth shows no signs of slowing. The average smartphone user in the U.S. is currently consuming more than 15 gigabits per month and is expected to be using more than 50 gigabits on a monthly basis by 2026, reflecting a CAGR of nearly 30%. The proliferation of value-added streaming services, mobile video conferencing, and other content-rich bandwidth intensive applications continues to stress existing 4G wireless networks, creating the need for more material additional network capital investments, and emerging AR and VR applications and other next gen capabilities are contributing virtually nothing to mobile data usage today given the limited coverage and low 5G device penetration, but we don\u2019t think that will be the case for long. The 5G network revolution is under way and it\u2019s quite possible, perhaps even likely the current growth projections for U.S. mobile data usage will prove to be conservative, much like what we\u2019ve seen in the past. The development of 5G-related, low-latency applications and services, additional growth from enterprise accounts, and even fixed wireless applications in the home could all drive usage much higher over time. We expect that the increased availability of spectrum in the marketplace, particularly on the midband side, will help enable this usage growth going forward. Spectrum has always been the lifeblood of the wireless industry, and given the capacity necessary to provide users a true 5G experience, it is more important today than ever before. Particularly significant in our view are midband spectrum assets like 2.5 Gig and the newly acquired C-band frequencies as they provide our customers with a crucial middle ground between the attractive propagation characteristics of low band spectrum and the deep capacity characteristics of higher band. We believe the results of the most recently completed C-band auction underscore the importance of this spectrum to our customers as they look to monetize the benefits of 5G. Importantly, as the carriers emphasized in their public comments after the auction, we expect this spectrum to be deployed quickly. The wireless industry is in a strong financial position and numerous steps have been taken by the carriers to not only fund the upfront purchase price of the spectrum but also to effectively deploy it. In fact, we are already seeing sizeable increases in activity in our own services segment, and consistent with our long-term outlook expectations, we expect to see higher levels of gross new business in our property segment beginning later this year, particularly in \u201922 and beyond. Part of this uptick in activity is in rural areas as stimulus funds from the government support smaller companies to effectively deploy wireless internet services, and as the major operators continue to fill in the white spaces in their network. The deployment of fixed wireless for households around the country using midband spectrum, as our customers are planning, could also provide further opportunities for us going forward. Taking all of these factors into account, we believe we have a highly attractive, long-term monetization opportunity in front of us as the carriers further densify their networks and add more equipment to existing lease sites to support their incremental capacity needs. A significant portion of this growth is locked into our existing contractual relationships. Other components of the growth may be more variable. Either way, we expect to see higher levels of activity in the marketplace accompanied by increasing wireless capex spend. On this point, analysts are projecting more than $35 billion in average annual capital spending from our customers over the next several years, which would represent industry record. With that in perspective, that average annual rate is more than double what the carriers spent back when 2G was actually deployed. While each of our customers have slightly different strategies to deploy 5G, we are confident that they will be successful in doing so. We also believe that our macro tower oriented U.S. portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to benefit from these accelerating deployments. Macro sites continue to be by far the most cost effective RF-efficient network engineering option and are also optimally located to help deliver coverage and capacity for hundreds of millions of people nationwide. As a result, we continue to believe that the vast majority of midband deployments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future will be on macro towers, and as our network infrastructure was ideally suited for our customers\u2019 needs for 2G, 3G, and 4G, and we have no reason to believe that 5G will be any different. What we do expect to be unique to 5G is the added use of massive MIMO technology for midband spectrum deployments on our macro towers, which should provide operators with more dynamic coverage and capacity capabilities. The race to nationwide 5G with the use of massive MIMO will require more fiber connections to antennas, increased DC power, and enough capacity to accommodate the size and weight of these more intelligent RF solutions. To prepare for these requirements, we have been proactively investing in more efficient and scalable power solutions at many of our sites. We\u2019ve also upgraded the capacity of many of our tower structures over the last decade, installed energy efficient LED lighting on many sites, and invested in site hardening initiatives where appropriate. Simply put, we stand ready to service our customers as they accelerate their 5G deployments. Importantly, macro sites may even be more critical today given the incremental density networks will require to support a 5G architecture, and because only one of our existing tenants is on more than half of our sites today, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive incremental lease-up at and capacity utilization as densification initiatives ramp up. As has been our experience, we would expect that roughly $0.90 of every dollar we generate from this organic leasing activity will flow straight to the bottom line. As a result, we expect to continue to drive strong operating leverage in the business along with modest capital intensity, reflecting two of the hallmarks of our last several decades [indiscernible]. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate strong operating profit margins, including more than 78% in 2021. All of these factors contribute to our confidence in our ability to drive average annual U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth of at least 5% in 2027, normalized for the sprint churn impact, and at least 6% from \u201923 to \u201927 specifically calculated on the same basis. Importantly, more than two-thirds of this growth is now contractually locked in, given the signing of our MLA with Dish in the first quarter. Embedded with these expectations is the assumption that our portfolio of wireless towers will be our fastest growing asset, as has been the case over the last five years, and our organic tenant billings growth was an average of roughly 40 basis points higher than our overall U.S. metrics. This resilient trend, in our view, was another point of validation that macro tower will continue to be the focal point of modern wireless networks, generating the best economics across the telecommunications real estate universe.  Going forward, we expect these economics to get even better. Margins will benefit from densification driven leasing activity and continued amendments, while costs will remain largely fixed and capital intensity should continue to be low. Existing leases will escalate at historical rates of at least 3% and normal course churn should be quite modest, likely trending down over time particularly once we work through the Sprint cancellations over the next few years. We intend to remain laser focused on maximizing our sustainable cash flow growth from these fundamental 5G drivers.  We also believe that the economics of our U.S. business and specifically of our macro tower sites can be further enhanced through the implementation of collective platform expansion initiatives. Chief among them is edge compute, which is starting to come into clear view as true 5G becomes a reality for consumers, and perhaps even more importantly for the enterprise segment. We expect the key drivers of demand for edge compute solutions to be the emerging need for incremental Cloud-RAN locations and lower latency applications processing in a 5G environment. As more and more data processing evolves to the network edge to support those needs, we anticipate that new micro edge data center architecture will be necessary to complement the existing regional framework. Select locations within our nationwide macro tower asset base, which by definition are at the mobile network edge, are positioned to play a meaningful role in this evolution. The underlying thesis supporting this belief is the concept that, as it has been for the last two decades in the deployment of wireless networks, shared neutral host infrastructure will be the most cost effective and efficient way to rapidly deploy cloud-native 5G applications at scale. Given that our attractively located tower sites have existing access to fiber and power while already hosting multiple communications providers, they are a natural candidate to represent hub locations for these low latency wireless edge data centers.  Scale deployment of a true mobile edge remains several years away, but in our view the TAM could be quite significant, running well into the billions of dollars annually. In the meantime, we have some half dozen ongoing small scale distributed commute trials at our tower sites, creating a beachhead to larger scale true mobile edge deployments. Additionally, our Colo Atl facility continues to outperform our expectations and we are having meaningful conversations with a number of key stakeholders across the data center and cloud sectors regarding the optimal requirements for the 5G edge. As we\u2019ve noted previously, we intend to explore global joint ventures or partnerships to effectively leverage these inherent opportunities, and we continue to work through a number of different scenarios on that front. The early data points we are seeing throughout the industry all suggest that this can be a meaningful, scalable opportunity that can represent solid upside for us in due time, and we are devoting resources internally to ensure that we are in a position to be opportunistic and agile. In the context of the long term outlook we discussed last quarter, we believe that mobile edge compute could eventually represent meaningful potential upside. Having said that, we are going to remain disciplined from a capital deployment perspective, as you would expect. Recurring revenue, strong long term growth prospects, healthy ROIC and an attractive margin profile are all prerequisites for us to deploy meaningful capital anywhere, and that includes our efforts on the platform expansion side. Our preliminary assessments indicate that the edge opportunity fits nicely into our framework, but we will need to prove out this thesis going forward.  Taking into account the strong underlying baseline growth path we have in the U.S. for the next decade, we are in a position to be thoughtful, deliberate and strategic with these types of initiatives. Additionally, while we are laser focused on driving incremental value in the U.S., we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy capital internationally where high quality, scaled macro tower portfolios are likely to come to market, and while my comments today are focused on our U.S. operation and marketplace, the exact same approach can be duplicated globally. Whether it\u2019s growth, platform expansion opportunities, or margin expansion, the messages globally are identical. With our roughly 220,000 sites pro forma for the Telxius acquisition, we have an unmatched presence in some of the fastest growing wireless broadband markets - period, and we can offer to a number of different parties a one-stop capability that is second to none. While we would expect to expand the depth of this presence over time so as not to be complacent, we believe that it already gives us a significant competitive advantage As we have always done on a global basis, we will be seeking to maximize long term growth in AFFO per share while maintaining attractive returns on invested capital. We also continue to invest in our people, our systems and processes and remain focused on numerous ESG initiatives while dedicating ourselves to ensuring a diverse and inclusive culture throughout the company. To summarize, I want to reiterate our excitement about the U.S. market. We are in the very early stages of a transformation period in U.S. wireless technology, one that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we live, work and play while opening up tremendous new possibilities across numerous industries. Our extensive portfolio of communications real estate across the country sits at the cross-section of the elements that can make this transformation a reality, and as a result we are positioned to drive compelling long term stockholder returns while continuing to provide industry-leading service levels to both existing and new customers. Finally, I want to recognize our nearly 6,000 employees around the world who are working tirelessly for all of us. Achieving the types of results Rod is going to walk you through now, particularly through this horrific pandemic, is really remarkable, and I want them to know just how much we all appreciate their dedication and hard work. With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks Tom, and thanks everyone for joining today\u2019s call. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. As you saw in today\u2019s press release, we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2021 as 5G ramps up in the U.S. and as carriers in our international markets deploy significant capital towards their network enhancement initiatives. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights for the quarter. First, we announced the acquisition of Telxius, which we believe will be transformational for our European business. We also signed a master lease agreement with Dish which locks in attractive multi-year growth in cash property revenue for us, beginning in 2022. Second, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint and we saw this reflected in both our solid tenant billings growth and in the high volume of new bills in the quarter. Third, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment grade balance sheet, issuing $1.4 billion in senior unsecured notes and refinancing existing debt at highly attractive rates. Finally, we made good progress regarding the financing plan for our expanding European business, including private capital. We expect to communicate specific details of our plan prior to closing the first tranche of towers, which we anticipate will be later this quarter. With that, please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.130 billion grew by 7.9% or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 1.7%, or 5.8% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. These growth rates were right in line with our expectations and continue to reflect the essential nature of mobile services and the importance of our tower portfolio throughout our served markets. Moving to the right side of the slide, organic growth was once again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billing growth was 4.1%, including 3.6% in our U.S. and Canada segment and 5% in our international markets. In the U.S., we had a solid quarter of gross new business commencement, as expected, and churn was right in the middle of our historical 1% to 2% range. Escalators were 2.6%, impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLA with T-Mobile. For the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. Meanwhile, international organic tenant billings growth was particularly strong in Latin America, coming in at 7.9%, and was also quite solid in Africa where we generated growth of 7.4%. In both regions, we are continuing to see our tenants actively deploying equipment across their networks as mobile data consumption grows rapidly. Activity in Nigeria was a highlight once again, and we continue to expect growth in that market to ramp up going forward.  We also had a strong quarter in Europe, particularly in Germany where gross new leasing growth was around 7% driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In India, we saw an organic tenant billings growth decline of 1.6%, in line with our expectations as we continue to work through the latter stages of AGR and consolidated related churn in the market.  On the gross new business side, we saw another solid quarter which was further complemented by contributions from the more than 5,000 sites we have constructed in the market since the beginning of 2020. Notably, global commenced monthly new business in the quarter, including contributions from new build, was more than $11 million, up about 17% versus the prior year period and representing a new ATC record level. Turning to Slide 7, our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% or 14.9% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.440 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 66.7%, up nearly three full percentage points over the prior year driven by continued organic growth and prudent cost controls throughout the business, as well as the benefits of straight line revenue related to the T-Mobile MLA signed late last year.  Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was 6.6% for the quarter as significant scale across our footprint continued to yield benefits along with some bad debt reversals in India.  Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share each grew by about 24%. These growth rates included the benefit of the non-recurrence of about $63 million in one-time cash interest expense booked in Q1 of last year associated with our purchase of MTN\u2019s minority stake in our Ghana and Uganda businesses. Normalizing for that item, growth would have been around 16%, the highest rate in several years. This was driven by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash interest, non-recurring cash tax refund, and seasonally low maintenance capex.  I will note that the cash tax and maintenance capex trends we saw this quarter are largely attributable to timing, so these lines are expected to pick back up over the rest of the year. As a result, we expect that Q1 will be the highest level of quarterly consolidated AFFO per share that we see in 2021. Finally, on an FX-neutral basis, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth for the quarter would have been right around 26%.  Let\u2019s now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I\u2019ll start by reviewing a few of the key high level drivers. First, due to the negative impacts of translational FX fluctuations in some of our international markets, we are reducing our property revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint. On an FX-neutral basis, we would be increasing our property revenue expectations due to higher pass through and straight line revenue internationally. Second, despite these FX headwinds, we are raising our outlook for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO. The adjusted EBITDA outperformance is primarily attributable to higher expected contributions from our services segment driven by pre-construction site acquisition zoning and permitting work for our customers as well as slightly more favorable SG&A trends in the business. Regarding our improved AFFO expectation, in addition to the services outperformance we are anticipating lower cash taxes and cash interest expense for the year. Finally, per our historical practice, our revised outlook continues to exclude the impacts of our pending Telxius transaction and its associated financing. We expect the transaction to close in multiple tranches, beginning with the majority of the European sites later in the second quarter and with some of the German rooftops and the Latin American sites in Q3. Once the assets begin to close, we will update further iterations of our guidance to include these contributions. We look forward to quickly integrating the portfolio and, as previously noted, expect the deal to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. With that, let\u2019s turn into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 7.5% at the midpoint. The decline as compared to the prior guidance is due to approximately $48 million in negative translational FX impact, which is being partially offset by about $23 million in additional international pass through and straight line revenue.  Moving to Slide 9, you\u2019ll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth projections across all regions as the global leasing environment remains consistent with our prior expectations across our footprint. We continue to expect consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 3% to 4% in 2021. In the U.S., as Tom outlined earlier, we anticipate a prolonged period of strong growth driven by 5G related densification initiatives by the carriers as they roll out multiple spectrum bands. We continue to expect that gross new business activity will accelerate through the year and into 2022. Looking to Latin America, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be roughly 7% for the year. Despite some challenges around COVID trends in the region, carrier activity remains consistent as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments. In Africa, we expect to generate organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8%, driven primarily by spending on 4G deployments.  We are seeing especially strong growth in Nigeria where new business trends continue to inflect positively and where our contract structures with key tenants are supporting growth. As we move into the back of the year, we anticipate that Africa organic tenant billings growth will accelerate to above 9%.  In Europe, we continue to expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% for the full year and are seeing solid trends, particularly on the gross new business side. We\u2019re especially encouraged by what we are seeing in Germany, where organic tenant billings growth excluding churn hit 7% in Q1 for the first time. We expect positive new business trends to continue going forward as incumbent carriers accelerate their 5G initiatives and as a new tenant begins to roll out its network. Finally in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. While we believe we\u2019re in the very late stages of the consolidation process, we maintain our expectation that we will see elevated churn this year as the post-AGR environment sorts itself out. With that said, we remain optimistic that the long term growth trajectory in the market should be more favorable, particularly given that the structural framework of the wireless sector today is probably the most constructive it has been in the last decade. Moving to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of 9.6% despite about $30 million in negative translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Around $33 million in incrementally expected services gross margin, $3 million or so in net straight line favorability, and about $4 million in lower cash SG&A is enabling us to more than offset the FX headwinds. The services activity we are seeing is broad-based and spread across multiple tenants, and in our view another indication that U.S. network investment activity is in the early stages of a sustainable acceleration.  Turning to Slide 11, we are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of over 9% with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.25 per share. Services segment outperformance as well as about $13 million in net cash interest and cash tax favorability are driving this upside and enabling us to absorb about $25 million in unfavorable FX impact. On a per-share basis, we expect growth of 9% for the year and continue to drive towards our goal of delivering double-digit growth. Moving onto Slide 12, let\u2019s review our capital deployment expectations for 2021, which are broadly consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continuing focus on driving strong, sustainable growth in consolidated AFFO per share. Distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top capital allocation priority and we continue to expect to allocate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15% subject to our board\u2019s approval.  Regarding capex, we are raising our projections by $25 million at the midpoint due to some additional expected U.S. land investments and a modest increase in start-up capex internationally. On the acquisition front, we spent around $115 million in the first quarter and continue to expect to deploy over $9 billion for the Telxius transaction later this year.  As I mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress on the financing plan for our European business and our acquisition of the Telxius assets. This includes on the private capital front, where we continue to remain confident that we can bring in one or more high quality strategic counterparties to purchase minority stakes in our European business not only to help us finance the Telxius transaction but also to collaborate on future European expansion opportunities.  On the debt side of the equation, we continue to expect to take our net leverage up to the high five times range. Having completed a U.S. dollar denominated senior unsecured notes offering in Q1, we anticipate that other near term debt issuances are likely to be euro denominated. This is consistent with our expected material expansion of euro-based revenues in our business and will enable us to take advantage of highly attractive financing rates. Finally, any remaining funding need that isn\u2019t covered by debt issuances or private capital will be in the form of equity through a common equity issuance and/or a mandatory convertible preferred issuance. Our goal continues to be to fund this transaction in a way that is not only optimal from a capital structure perspective but also enables us to optimize shareholder return. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on our new build program, which has accelerated over the last few years to meet increasing demand for new sites by a number of our key international tenants. As you can see, since 2016 and including our expectations for this year, we will have added over 23,000 sites to our portfolio through new construction. In 2020, we built over 5,800 towers, a new American Tower record, and we\u2019re off to a great start in 2021, adding nearly 2,000 sites in our international markets for the quarter, a level of activity only exceeded by that of Q4 2020. Moving to the middle of the slide, you can see that we are seeing highly attractive returns on capital deployed towards new sites. In Q1, average day one new build NOI yields were around 12%. In our APAC region where we added over 1,300 sites, we saw highly attractive yields of around 15%, and in Africa where we added more than 500 sites, we averaged day one returns of over 10%. We\u2019re anticipating another record year of new builds in 2021 with 6,500 sites at the midpoint of our outlook. The majority of these deployments will be focused across these same APAC and Africa regions, where we expect to drive the most attractive new build returns and where the vast majority of new build activity is for investment grade anchor tenants. Looking beyond 2021, we expect this trend of increasing demand for incremental wireless infrastructure to continue as carriers in markets with fast growing populations and surging demand for mobile data work to enhance their networks. We believe that our existing global scale, track record of providing best-in-class service levels and strong relationships with MNOs place American Tower in a favorable position to act as a preferred partner for these large scale deployments. As such, we\u2019ll look to take advantage of the opportunity to continue growing our international portfolio by deploying capital for high return new build projects, and as Tom noted on last quarter\u2019s call, based on the demand we are seeing for new sites internationally, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next five years. Finally on Slide 14 and in summary, Q1 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, dividend growth, and strong new build activity. We were able to secure a transformational deal in Europe with the pending Telxius transaction, signed a value-additive long term MLA in the U.S., continued to enhance our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing, and remained focused on cost controls and driving sustainable recurring growth. We are excited about the global demand for tower space and look forward to making additional progress on many fronts through the rest of the year as we seek to deliver compelling total returns to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much, good morning. \nTom Bartlett: Hey Simon.\nSimon Flannery: How are you? Thanks for the overview on the U.S. portfolio - very helpful. It does seem like you\u2019re also becoming more constructive on Europe. We have the Telxius transaction and to Rod\u2019s comments about looking for partners, it seems like that extends beyond this deal. So, perhaps you\u2019d just give us a little bit more color on what you see in Europe now. It seems like Germany in particular is very strong, but are you open to that becoming an even bigger part of your future beyond the Telxius deal, and what exactly are you looking for in these partnerships as opposed to raising straight equity or debt, given the attractive capital markets there?\nTom Bartlett: Thanks Simon, thanks for the question. You know, we\u2019ve been looking at the European market for the better part of a dozen years, and we did create a couple beachhead properties, if you will, in France and Germany, pretty small, in kind of the 4,000 to 5,000 sites a number of years ago, and we\u2019ve continued to look in those particular markets to see if there are opportunities. One of the challenges that we always saw in those markets were who the counterparty was, what the capital would be that required to upgrade the sites themselves, and really what were the long-term growth projections and opportunities in the marketplace, and so as such, we were never successful in terms of kind of landing any particular transactions up until the transaction that we\u2019re just about ready to close with Telxius. A lot of that is a function of the relationship, I think, that we\u2019ve built with Telefonica over so many years and have--you know, they have such credibility, and I think we have a lot of credibility with them. We were able to put our hands on this particular portfolio, and I think in particular for those very reasons that I mentioned before that got in the way of us being able to close things, is that the portfolio itself is very solid, it\u2019s a terrific set of assets, terrifically located, as I said good counterparty, and now what we\u2019re starting to see in the marketplace, as Rod talked about, was really the evolution of 5G. We\u2019re starting to see more spectrum being deployed to support 5G and we\u2019re really, I think, just on the front end of what that 5G deployment is going to look like. We see it accelerating particularly in markets like Germany, and we see the opportunity for a new entrant who is going to be coming into the marketplace, and so we think it really rounds out our overall portfolio. I think we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have a presence in so many different -- very, very important markets around the globe, and this just increases the overall presence we have and what was kind of a hole, if you will, in our portfolio given the size of the assets that we had before. And so now, we\u2019re going to have 30,000 sites in the marketplace, terrific counterparty, and as I said right in the beginning part of what we think is going to be a long-term growth trajectory in the region, and so we\u2019ll use that as a way to be able to continue to grow if it makes sense and if we find good assets, good opportunities in the region. I think we\u2019re positioning ourselves with some very interesting private capital, and so that will increase the overall platform for our ability to grow in the market. I mean, they\u2019re very passive - we\u2019re operating it. They\u2019re minority partners, as you would expect, but they are very interested also in growing their portfolios in our base of assets, and hopefully they\u2019ll be able to participate in future potential investments with us.  I think that this is all coming together quite nicely for us, and we\u2019ve received the approvals to be able to move forward with the transaction in all due respects, and so we\u2019re excited about what the region has in front of us. As I said, equally as important, we\u2019re excited now about what that brings to our overall global footprint and how important that could be to TSBs, hyper scalers, who knows who might be looking for kind of a one-stop shop, if you will, in looking at our over 200,000 sites in these key markets, and we look to continue to grow that. Rod talked about the 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that we\u2019re looking at, and so we very much have our sights on increasing our footprint globally, and I think this is a great step.\nSimon Flannery: Great, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks, good morning guys.\nTom Bartlett: Hey Ric.\nRic Prentiss: Hey. I\u2019m going to follow on Simon\u2019s question a little bit there. Tom, if the private capital makes sense in Europe, does it make sense in other areas outside of Europe to come onboard with you guys?\nTom Bartlett: It very well may, Ric. You know, we\u2019ve had JV partners in the form of MNOs in the past, as you well know - with MTN, who were a great partner, and it very well may. We\u2019ll look at it on a case-by-case basis and look at the opportunities. We think we have a good playbook, if you will, that we\u2019ve created as a result of the work that we\u2019ve done on this particular transaction, and there\u2019s definitely a lot of interest, and so we\u2019ll look at that as perhaps the means to create a broader platform for our ability to grow. So, it\u2019s very possible, and as you know, we\u2019ll look at everything on an individual basis, a case-by-case basis.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. You also pointed obviously to some excitement about a new entrant in Germany - I assume that\u2019s the Drillisch folks. What can you tell us about their aspirations or what type of network they\u2019re thinking of building?\nTom Bartlett: I think that\u2019s probably a better question for them in terms of what they\u2019re actually looking for. They recently, though, have executed a roaming agreement with Telefonica, so they have a very strong relationship, I think, with TEF in the market, which we\u2019ll then be able to hopefully take advantage of. I think that will unfold over the year as they\u2019ve said publicly, in terms of putting that all together. They are looking to roll out 5G, urban markets first, and so this is where our rooftop penetration, rooftop assets in that market as we\u2019ve talked about has just been so incredibly valuable, and that\u2019s a particular asset base that we just didn\u2019t have before. We were quite rural in terms of the portfolio we had before, so this really takes it up a few notches in terms of our ability to be successful in the marketplace, and my sense is they will take advantage of the rooftop assets probably out of the gate.\nRic Prentiss: Okay, and thinking of MLAs, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions with Verizon having signed MLAs with Crown and SBAC. You guys have the Verizon portfolio towers from a transaction a few years ago. Talk just a little bit about what the path--the give and the take is on an MLA with Verizon with you guys.\nTom Bartlett: Well, as you know, Ric, we already have a long term master lease agreement in place with Verizon, and so it wasn\u2019t one where it needed to be extended from that perspective. We have a terrific relationship with Verizon. We\u2019re in conversations with them, I\u2019m in conversations with them on quite a regular basis, not just on this but on a lot of broader issues in the marketplace, and so we have a holistic rate that we have right now with them that expires at the end of the year, and that\u2019s just one element of this broader, long term master lease agreement with the, and whether that continues or not, who knows, but we\u2019re, I think, providing excellent service for Verizon. They are being very aggressive on rollout of 5G and C-band, and we\u2019ll be there every step of the way for them.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. Last one from me, it looks like you\u2019ve removed the work aspirational from just having your target on AFFO per share be double-digit. Does that mean--you know, obviously it\u2019s a goal, but it\u2019s not--I think aspirational kind of scared some people last time around.\nTom Bartlett: Well, it is a goal. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s aspirational or whatever, whatever word you want, but my compensation is driven on AFFO per share growth and return on invested capital, and our shareholders require that too, so we very much have an objective of that double-digit.  Now, it\u2019s not going to happen maybe in every year, it\u2019s long term, but we\u2019ve been able to be very successful in terms of driving that kind of performance over the last 10 years and we\u2019re very focused on continually driving to that kind of performance going forward. 2022, you know, we do have the churn impact associated with the Sprint assets, so could that be a challenge? Perhaps, but our goal is still the same, so I think we have a number of levers. We\u2019re going to be bringing on the Telxius assets, which I think we\u2019ll be very happy with those results and what that kind of accretion should be to take advantage of the markets, and we\u2019ll have our normal solid growth that we see going on in the business. We just increased our overall EBITDA performance for 2021, and so we\u2019ll remain laser focused on all of our costs, including all of our capital being spent. Again, our goal is to drive that kind of performance.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense, thanks Tom. Everybody stay well.\nTom Bartlett: You too, Ric.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Atkin from RBC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Atkin: Thanks. I wanted to ask about Telxius, and you talked about strategic counterparties. At a high level, can you talk a little bit about the types of things that are factoring into your--with respect to governance, valuation or just other factors that are going to play a role in how this shakes out?  Then it\u2019s been a couple of conference calls since you mentioned fiber, and I just wondered if there\u2019s an update there or is that less of a focus these days in some of your Latin American properties. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Maybe I\u2019ll ask Rod to address the first question and I\u2019ll take the second one, John. \nRod Smith: Sure Tom, that sounds great. Thanks Jonathan for the question. Hope you\u2019re doing well. From a high level in terms of our Telxius financing, our plan has not changed, and we continue to make very good progress on the path that we originally announced, when we announced that we were entering into the transaction itself. There\u2019s a few broad principles that we\u2019re looking for. One is we expect to finance this deal in a way that\u2019s consistent with our investment grade credit. That still is the focus. Our aim is to minimize the dilution of our current common stockholders, so continue to be focused on that as well, and we expect to finance this transaction in a way that supports it being immediately accretive, which is what we said early on and that\u2019s continuing to be our focus and our expectation here as we move forward. A couple of things in terms of the internal workings of the financing plan. I don\u2019t want to get into details around the governance and valuation and those sorts of things, but one thing I would say valuation-wise, it\u2019s very consistent with the valuation of what we\u2019re doing with Telxius. In terms of the minority stakes that we are selling, we\u2019re selling minority stakes potentially in our European business not just to Telxius, but we will be putting our legacy businesses, combining that with the Telxius assets, so one key point is we do expect our debt to come up to the high five times - we\u2019ve said that before, we\u2019re still very comfortable in that range, and we do believe that that\u2019s consistent with our investment grade credit rating. We\u2019ve had many discussions with the credit agencies and we do not expect any risk of downgrades or outlook changes, or anything from that perspective. Additionally, near term senior notes that we may issue in order to fund the Telxius transaction are likely to be denominated in euro currency, and that will allow us to take into the very attractive rates that we see in the euro market certainly.  Then on the private capital front, as Tom alluded to and I mentioned in comments, we continue to progress along that path, and we\u2019re very confident that we can bring in one or more very strategic investors. We certainly are talking to the world\u2019s premier investors and certainly folks that understand this base, that understand the European market and other markets, quite frankly, as well as have relationships with some of our biggest customers around the globe, so there may be more than just financial benefits here to our shareholders but also strategic and kind of broader partnership benefits as well. Certainly that\u2019s a key focus. Then the final piece of the financing plan will come in the form of equity, so whatever is not funded through the increased net leverage that I talked about and through the euro debt offerings and private capital, we expect to go into the market and issue some equity.  In terms of timing, we do expect the transaction to begin to close in the second quarter probably as early as late May for some of the European markets. The Latin American markets, we\u2019re originally expecting that they would close probably sometime in Q3. There is a chance that Brazil and some of the other markets could close as early as the end of May or at some point in Q2, but we\u2019ll continue to work through the timing there. There will be some assets, particularly some select rooftops that will close in Europe in Q3, not in Q2, so we will have multiple closings across Q2 and across Q3. That\u2019s kind of the way that it shakes out, and again we remain very confident that this financing plan and our patience in putting it together and managing through the details I really going to pay off for our shareholders, and we\u2019re in very good shape to begin to execute on this in the month of May as we prepare to close the first tranches of the Telxius transaction.\nTom Bartlett: Then John, with regard to your second question with where we are with fiber as one of our platform extension initiatives, first of all where we are, we have a six country fiber footprint - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, SA and India, and we cover over 30,000 route kilometres. We actually passed 1.25 million homes in those markets, and the networks themselves are a mix of active long haul, metro, some B2B in Mexico and Brazil, and a concentration of fiber to passive optical networks in SA, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina.  We\u2019ve spent just over a billion dollars of capex over the past four years in those markets - $700 million for acquisitions and $300 million for development and redevelopment capex, so we\u2019ve been monitoring it very closely. From a revenue perspective, I think we generated about $100 million in 2020, and our ROIC for those particular investments collectively is in kind of the 5%, 5.5% kind of range. Interesting, the SA assets, the return on invested capital is probably double that.  So what we\u2019re thinking about strategically, again we\u2019re looking at this from an initiative perspective, a platform initiative perspective. Some of the underlying elements of it, the foundations of it, again go back to how we\u2019re looking at the overall tower model - multi service, multi tenant, long term anchor contract, escalators, exclusive real estate rights, a way for us to really be able to create a competitive advantage and really complement the power returns that we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last 10 years or so.  Our strategy really has kind of two prongs. I would say the first is to pivot and transform our current fiber businesses in Mexico and Brazil into wholesale long term contracts. We\u2019ll be looking to do this through long term contracts with Tier 1 carriers, also could involve some strategic inorganic transactions like we were just talking about before, and the focus is clearly creating a competitive, long term strategic asset in those markets. Then the second strategy really entails reaching certain economics in these deployments, particularly in SA and Brazil, and a focus on future investments in some of our emerging neutral host open access networks. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic where it obviously makes sense, be monitoring it very closely, but we do see that we\u2019ll see kind of a shift to open passive optical and multi-tenant access networks over time - we think that\u2019s a great way to be able to improve the return on invested capital, and our regional focus is currently right now on Latin America where most of the assets are and leveraging our existing M&O relationships. We think we can create that model in LatAm and then be able to scale it globally. I mean, that\u2019s kind of where we are. It\u2019s still a work in progress, but I think we\u2019ve learned a lot and I think we\u2019re making great progress on the strategy.\nJohn Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. One on the services sides, if you can give us any updates in terms of how we should think about the cadence of revenues and services margin in the next couple quarters, and then I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of the breadth of the strength. I think in the prior remarks, you mentioned pretty diverse in terms of contribution, so if you can give us any color there.  Then secondly on the SG&A front in India, it looks like you\u2019re moving past some of the elevated bad debt that hit you a year ago, so just trying to get a better sense of how we should think about that in terms of whether there\u2019s any incremental bad debt you anticipate in that region, or whether you\u2019ve moved past that. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Yes Matt, I\u2019ll let Rod get into that.\nRod Smith: Yes, thanks Tom. Thanks Matt, hope you\u2019re doing well. Thanks for the question. With regards to our services business, as you saw in the comments earlier and I think Tom alluded to it, we are seeing a significant uplift in our services revenue for the year, so you saw us raise our full-year outlook to about $175 million, up from about $120 million. The margins are broadly consistent year over year, so we\u2019re expecting that mid to just a touch above mid 50% margins - that\u2019s similar to what we saw in 2020, that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting in 2021.  In terms of the timing of the services revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of, let\u2019s say, applications and activity in the market, and we expect that to continue throughout the next couple of quarters, so more than 60% of the revenue of the $175 million is back-end weighted, so we would expect in Q3 and Q4, both of those periods would be north of $50 million per quarter in terms of revenue. That\u2019s kind of the way to think about services. Services, what we\u2019re seeing really is kind of a broad-based increase in services that goes across most all of our large customers, certainly, and it\u2019s focused on [indiscernible] engineering, miles analysis, things like that. Those sorts of activities are generally kind of front-end loaded. That services work happens well before you see leasing activity and any kind of an uplift in leasing revenue, so it\u2019s a really good sign here in terms of the activity level, the services that we see kind of ramping up towards the end of this year and as we transition into 2022.  When you think about India and bad debt, there\u2019s still a few places where we\u2019re watching customers around the globe, a couple in Africa and a couple in India certainly. We\u2019re doing really well. There\u2019s no significant incremental bad debt in our outlook, and our accounts receivable, the way it sits at the end of Q1 is broadly in line with the way that it sat at the end of Q1 last year, so we haven\u2019t had a significant increase in accounts receivable. We continue to collect and be pleased with the way that our customers are paying in India and in the select places in Africa that we\u2019re watching. We did end up unwinding a bad debt reserve in India in Q1 by just under $10 million or so, so that\u2019s certainly a good sign; but with that said, we continue to watch India. There\u2019s a few things that we\u2019re looking for relative to some of our customers there in terms of capital raise projects that they\u2019re in, and certainly the amount of liabilities through the AGR and some of the activity between our customers and the government to try to negotiate those, we watch that quite closely. But that\u2019s really the story on accounts receivable and bad debt, but we\u2019ve had a good quarter, we did well throughout 2020, and we don\u2019t have any significant incremental bad debt in our outlook for 2021.\nMatt Niknam: That\u2019s great, thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess Rod or Tom, obviously the thing that\u2019s going to propel the gross revenue trajectory domestically is the C-band auction and the pursuit of exploiting that opportunity among the carriers. Can you--for the benefit of us generally across this global portfolio that you have, can you kind of maybe tick off the next one, two or three markets where you\u2019re expecting this kind of opportunity to emerge with spectrum options forthcoming?  Then the second question is John Stankey at AT&T kind of said he was, quote-unquote, skittish about the supply chain marketplace, even in the United States. Could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the supply chain, chip availability specifically, affecting your company\u2019s or customers\u2019 ability to deploy and how you\u2019ve factored that into your thinking about the guide? Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Sure Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start off and Rod can chime in with some additional commentary. What we\u2019re seeing around the globe, as I think both Rod and I mentioned even in our remarks, was just an onslaught of new spectrum coming into the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing in India, we\u2019re seeing clearly in Europe, we\u2019re seeing in Latin America, and they\u2019re wide blocks of spectrum. For 5G to be effective, you need a wider swath of spectrum. It can\u2019t be the 10 meg - you know, you\u2019re looking at 20 to 40 to 60 meg of spectrum, and so that\u2019s the first sign, I think David, that we see because, as I mentioned and as you well know, spectrum is the lifeblood of being able to roll out any of these new technologies, and for 5G to be able to truly realize the full 5G experience in terms of speed and latency, you need significant amounts of it. I look at--and in my comment before on Europe, what we\u2019ve seen in certain of those critical markets, critical countries in Europe really stepping up to launching a lot of new spectrum, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re really now starting to see some outsized growth in those particular markets, something that we hadn\u2019t seen for several years, and that really drove us to looking at some of the growth curves in that market for us to even lean into some of the assets that are there. That\u2019s just kind of the first sign of it, I think. You know, you look at markets like Africa, though - I mean, Africa--I think Rod had mentioned they were kind of in the 8%, looking at growing to 9%, even kind of ending out the year. You look at markets like Nigeria and things like that, where we\u2019re talking kind of double-digit growth rates - that\u2019s just because the wire line presence there just doesn\u2019t exist, and wireless broadband is everything that our customers are investing in, so you have slightly different reasons for some of the growth. Many of the markets are just getting into 4G, so we\u2019re still on the front of that 4G curve, and Latin America, you look at Brazil growth, you look at Mexico growth, they\u2019re in kind of the 7%, 8% growth range, so we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019re seeing outside of the United States, and what\u2019s really driving it clearly is more spectrum, more wireless penetration. Unfortunately, the pandemic has actually driven even more of a need for connectivity, and so we\u2019re seeing even more wireless usage in those markets in particular, again because the wire line markets are just so poor and non-existent.  We would expect to see Europe kicking in with 5G, Africa continued growth as 4G becomes more of a reality there, Latin America similarly 4G into 5G ultimately, and even in India, the growth there is strong. We\u2019ve got the churn issues that we have to deal with in that particular market and we\u2019re getting our arms around it and making sure that we really nail those there, but it\u2019s not a growth issue. They\u2019ve got new spectrum, they\u2019ve got 4G, you see the likes of Facebook, you see all of the big foreign investment that\u2019s coming into the marketplace, so it\u2019s really an exciting market from a broadband wireless perspective. That kind of gives it on a global scale, and from a supply chain perspective, we don\u2019t see any impacts on our side from a supply chain perspective at this point. Our customers are the ones that are kind of front line with issues that they may have from some of the OEMs and things like that, but at least from our perspective, we\u2019re not seeing any impact from that perspective.\nDavid Barden: Okay, great. Thanks Tom, appreciate it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Was hoping you could talk a little bit more--you\u2019d talked about edge compute a little bit in your prepared remarks. Could you just kind of update us on how you\u2019re thinking about the business model for AMT, and obviously this is a longer term trend, any more views on data center investments and how you think you might monetize that, and then I have a follow-up.\nTom Bartlett: Okay. Let me take a step back a little bit. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing from an evolution perspective, if you will, first of all, this whole market is in fact developing. With regards specific to the edge, we are at the beginning and we\u2019re seeing certain elements align, if you will, but we\u2019re really starting to and trying to participate in those, but we really are at the beginning of it. If you start to think about, first of all, the [indiscernible] impact, what the cloud impact is, we just saw some recent announcements in the market relative to cloud layers aligning with some of the MNOs and we\u2019ve seen Verizon doing that over the last year or so, what we\u2019re starting to see is if you think about kind of the 4G low, midband power market and what it looks like at the site level, as we move into the 5G and lowband, midband, what we\u2019re starting to see at the site, for example, is a lot of--you know, MIMO is going to be starting to be deployed, a lot of antenna arrays, a lot of new fiber that\u2019s going up the pole themselves, five to 10 times more fiber strands needed, higher power, more heat, and so there\u2019s a lot of elements that are going on actually at the site itself, which is going to drive more and more equipment improvements to the public radio interface on the front hole which connects, actually, the tower to the base band unit itself. Now what we\u2019re starting to see is we\u2019re seeing Cloud-RAN and O-RAN. From an O-RAN perspective, it\u2019s different types of equipment that our customers are able to put together to be able to load onto the site, and at the base level, at the base band unit, which is where the data center element comes in, we\u2019re starting to see a disaggregation at the base band unit level into the DU and into the CU level, and that\u2019s giving our customers the ability and us to be able to look at where in fact we might be able to expand and be able to enjoy some of this additional compute capability that\u2019s going to exist out at the edge as the 5G experience becomes more prevalent throughout the country. We continue and expect to see this incremental convergence of this wire line and wireless network. We think it stresses the importance of that first mile network architecture, and so as a result we\u2019re actually very, very excited about the opportunity. It\u2019s a shared neutral host solution, we think it\u2019s going to be very efficient out at the site level, and we actually are exploring and going down the path of really two elements, two ways if you will. We\u2019ve talked about the distribute compute. You know, the enterprise workloads continue to move onto the public cloud, and so there\u2019s a growing near term market segment that\u2019s in use of that kind of off-prem cloud computing, it\u2019s really a hybrid solution, and so we\u2019re located on some [indiscernible], if you will, of our sites and you\u2019ll see them - there are shelters there, there\u2019s power, there\u2019s capability to be able to offer this kind of a capability to these kind of midsized enterprise accounts, and they\u2019re actually being quite successful. They\u2019re loading up very quickly and, believe me, they\u2019re not meaningful from an AMT perspective but they are absolutely meaningful from an experience perspective and learning exactly what our customers are going to be looking for. The bigger opportunity for us is still at the mobile edge compute side, and so that will become, we believe, more of a reality as that 5G world becomes more developed, so we have a number of MOUs with a number of different players focused on solutions to the MNOs, as well as focused on solutions to the cloud service providers. We\u2019re exploring those, putting those in front of those particular accounts and looking at what the ultimate opportunity would be, and the site is a perfect location for being able to expand our customers\u2019 edge compute capability, not just within the United States but on a global basis. If we can bring in 500 kilowatts of power into a particular site with a number of shelters that exist in the site to be able to load up racks and servers, we think--and give that cloud ramp, which will actually exist in that DU, so that\u2019s why that disaggregation is so important between those two particular elements of the RAN, we think that we can enjoy some significant opportunity upside here from this whole initiative. It is an extension of our existing platform - again, neutral host, but it really provides ultimately that cloud ramp which we think is going to be needed to be able to enjoy that kind of latency that our enterprise accounts and customers are going to be looking for.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you. I just wanted to follow up - when you think about Africa and particularly India, obviously some aggressive tower build plans over the next few years, but could you just talk a little bit about this year and potential COVID-related risks to those builds and any other risks to the business because of the pandemic? Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Yes, I think that the build itself--you know, our plan, our outlook I think has been the 6,000 to 7,000 sites. There could be some timing issues associated with the build. The need is there, I\u2019m certain that the sites are going to be built, but particularly in a market like India who are suffering so significantly right now, there can be a timing issue in terms of having essential people out in the marketplace to be able to build. Clearly lives saved is more important than towers built, so there could be some timing issues there, but ultimately over that five-year period, we are seeing the demand for that 40,000 to 50,000 sites that Rod laid out, and our forecast right now is for that 6,000 to 7,000 sites, there could be some timing issues associated with particularly the sites in India. I\u2019m not seeing the same implications in Africa at this point in time. By the way, our overall 6,000 to 7,000 sites, that outlook already includes some carving back of what we are expecting overall in the marketplace.  Relative to COVID overall, as we\u2019ve seen over the last year, our business is quite resilient. People need connectivity - I think that\u2019s been more obvious than ever over this past year, particularly in many of our global markets, and so our customers are doing everything possible that they can to be able to maintain that kind of connectivity. We\u2019re doing everything we possibly can to be able to support them, to be able to ensure that kind of connectivity, so we\u2019re working our tails off with our customers to make sure that we can do that.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. A couple questions. First on the U.S., as you think about your long term guidance, can you tell us what it assumes in terms of the mix of amendments versus new collocation, and the new site build program that you have, what percent of that would be in the U.S.? As the carriers deploy CDMA, do you have any indication that they\u2019re leaning more towards new leases as well? Then maybe just a follow-up on the escalator, Rod, if you can tell us a little bit more why it stepped down, and then when it will go back to 3%, and also if the Dish MLA, if you can confirm that\u2019s a 3% escalator as well. Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: I thought you said there were just a couple questions! \nBatya Levi: I know. I thought we should take this call longer. \nTom Bartlett: No, it\u2019s great. Thanks for being here, and thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll let Rod run with it. \nRod Smith: Yes, thanks for the questions, Batya. I\u2019ll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I miss anything, just remind me. Maybe I\u2019ll start at the end and work backwards a little bit. The escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for Q1 was about 2.6% - that really was driven by the impact of timing mechanics within the T-Mobile MLA, so as we signed a new MLA with T-Mobile, the escalator shifted from one period to another, and that affected the volume of escalator in Q1. But for the full year, we do expect the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above potentially, and Q2 we do expect the escalator for the U.S. to be 3.1%. There\u2019s no structural change, there\u2019s no permanent shift, it really is just a timing issue.  I\u2019ll also point out, it\u2019s a little ahead of time, but in 2022 you may see some lumpiness as well with the escalator, given the time shift here, but again for 2022 for the full year, we anticipate the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above as usual, so nothing to be concerned there. We haven\u2019t had any philosophy shift and no kind of contractual change in terms of what the escalator is. It remains at 3%, as it always has in the U.S. Then I think your next question was relative to the long term guidance, and maybe I\u2019ll just take a minute to remind the folks on the call of what that is. We\u2019re looking at over the next seven years, we\u2019ve put out guidance at least 4% organic tenant billings growth on average over that time period. That includes the Sprint churn, which will begin to roll off of our billing later this year in Q4, in the beginning of October. If you normalize for that, we\u2019re looking at that long term organic growth rate in the U.S. of about 5%. The other thing that I would point out here is if you look at just the first couple years, \u201921 and \u201922 on a Sprint impacted basis, where we\u2019ll see that churn again beginning in Q4 of 2021, the expected organic tenant billings including that will be around 2%, but normalizing that it will be around 5%. Once we get clear from that, when we get out to \u201923 and beyond, so \u201923 out to \u201927, even with the impact of the Sprint churn, we\u2019re predicting organic tenant billings growth north of 5%, and on a normalized basis for that same time period north of about 6%, so we are very excited and confident about the future in the U.S. We are seeing an acceleration of gross new biz. We\u2019re seeing that today, we expect that to continue, and that really is fueling these very solid organic tenant billings predictions over a long period of time - again, that seven years. Just a couple of key components here. I\u2019d remind you, 23% or two thirds of this, two thirds of this revenue that we need to hit these things are already contracted in our long term agreements and in some of these holistic deals, so that\u2019s key. That includes Dish being in here in the assumptions with some modest activity, which potentially could outperform depending on the pace and the level of their network build over that time period. Some of the C-band spectrum deployments for some carriers in some of the years may be in addition here and outside of the traditional holistics, so we\u2019re looking to that potentially as an upside. Then in terms of the collocation amendment mix, we\u2019re currently still at heavy amendment, 80% and 20% collocation - that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for a little while. It may vary from carrier to carrier, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s been consistently, and we expect that that will be the case for a couple years. But going out longer term, it will vary. We do expect that it could be a higher percentage of collocations than we\u2019ve traditionally seen as the carriers deploy this higher band spectrum and they have a need to densify their network builds over time, so we\u2019re certainly planning for some of that as well but it\u2019s probably too early to predict that with too much specificity in terms of what that would be in terms of the mix in the out years. Was there another piece in your question, Batya, that I didn\u2019t address?\nBatya Levi: Just the Dish MLA, does it have a 3% escalator?\nRod Smith: Yes, the Dish MLA has the 3% in there, so the escalator is consistent with everything else that we do and consistent with our philosophy here in the U.S. Then in terms of timing of the revenues, I\u2019ll just maybe highlight for folks that we do expect revenue to begin in 2022, and it will be modest in that year and then it will ramp up going forward, and we\u2019ll be working with Dish to help them roll out their network over an extended period of time. \nBatya Levi: Awesome, thanks so much. \nRod Smith: You\u2019re welcome. \nIgor Khislavsky: Okay, great. Well, thank you everybody for joining this morning. That will wrap it up. Hope everyone is doing well, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.\nRod Smith: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks Tom, and thanks everyone for joining today\u2019s call. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. As you saw in today\u2019s press release, we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2021 as 5G ramps up in the U.S. and as carriers in our international markets deploy significant capital towards their network enhancement initiatives. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights for the quarter. First, we announced the acquisition of Telxius, which we believe will be transformational for our European business. We also signed a master lease agreement with Dish which locks in attractive multi-year growth in cash property revenue for us, beginning in 2022. Second, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint and we saw this reflected in both our solid tenant billings growth and in the high volume of new bills in the quarter. Third, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment grade balance sheet, issuing $1.4 billion in senior unsecured notes and refinancing existing debt at highly attractive rates. Finally, we made good progress regarding the financing plan for our expanding European business, including private capital. We expect to communicate specific details of our plan prior to closing the first tranche of towers, which we anticipate will be later this quarter. With that, please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.130 billion grew by 7.9% or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 1.7%, or 5.8% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. These growth rates were right in line with our expectations and continue to reflect the essential nature of mobile services and the importance of our tower portfolio throughout our served markets. Moving to the right side of the slide, organic growth was once again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billing growth was 4.1%, including 3.6% in our U.S. and Canada segment and 5% in our international markets. In the U.S., we had a solid quarter of gross new business commencement, as expected, and churn was right in the middle of our historical 1% to 2% range. Escalators were 2.6%, impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLA with T-Mobile. For the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. Meanwhile, international organic tenant billings growth was particularly strong in Latin America, coming in at 7.9%, and was also quite solid in Africa where we generated growth of 7.4%. In both regions, we are continuing to see our tenants actively deploying equipment across their networks as mobile data consumption grows rapidly. Activity in Nigeria was a highlight once again, and we continue to expect growth in that market to ramp up going forward.  We also had a strong quarter in Europe, particularly in Germany where gross new leasing growth was around 7% driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In India, we saw an organic tenant billings growth decline of 1.6%, in line with our expectations as we continue to work through the latter stages of AGR and consolidated related churn in the market.  On the gross new business side, we saw another solid quarter which was further complemented by contributions from the more than 5,000 sites we have constructed in the market since the beginning of 2020. Notably, global commenced monthly new business in the quarter, including contributions from new build, was more than $11 million, up about 17% versus the prior year period and representing a new ATC record level. Turning to Slide 7, our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% or 14.9% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.440 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 66.7%, up nearly three full percentage points over the prior year driven by continued organic growth and prudent cost controls throughout the business, as well as the benefits of straight line revenue related to the T-Mobile MLA signed late last year.  Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was 6.6% for the quarter as significant scale across our footprint continued to yield benefits along with some bad debt reversals in India.  Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share each grew by about 24%. These growth rates included the benefit of the non-recurrence of about $63 million in one-time cash interest expense booked in Q1 of last year associated with our purchase of MTN\u2019s minority stake in our Ghana and Uganda businesses. Normalizing for that item, growth would have been around 16%, the highest rate in several years. This was driven by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash interest, non-recurring cash tax refund, and seasonally low maintenance capex.  I will note that the cash tax and maintenance capex trends we saw this quarter are largely attributable to timing, so these lines are expected to pick back up over the rest of the year. As a result, we expect that Q1 will be the highest level of quarterly consolidated AFFO per share that we see in 2021. Finally, on an FX-neutral basis, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth for the quarter would have been right around 26%.  Let\u2019s now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I\u2019ll start by reviewing a few of the key high level drivers. First, due to the negative impacts of translational FX fluctuations in some of our international markets, we are reducing our property revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint. On an FX-neutral basis, we would be increasing our property revenue expectations due to higher pass through and straight line revenue internationally. Second, despite these FX headwinds, we are raising our outlook for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO. The adjusted EBITDA outperformance is primarily attributable to higher expected contributions from our services segment driven by pre-construction site acquisition zoning and permitting work for our customers as well as slightly more favorable SG&A trends in the business. Regarding our improved AFFO expectation, in addition to the services outperformance we are anticipating lower cash taxes and cash interest expense for the year. Finally, per our historical practice, our revised outlook continues to exclude the impacts of our pending Telxius transaction and its associated financing. We expect the transaction to close in multiple tranches, beginning with the majority of the European sites later in the second quarter and with some of the German rooftops and the Latin American sites in Q3. Once the assets begin to close, we will update further iterations of our guidance to include these contributions. We look forward to quickly integrating the portfolio and, as previously noted, expect the deal to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. With that, let\u2019s turn into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 7.5% at the midpoint. The decline as compared to the prior guidance is due to approximately $48 million in negative translational FX impact, which is being partially offset by about $23 million in additional international pass through and straight line revenue.  Moving to Slide 9, you\u2019ll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth projections across all regions as the global leasing environment remains consistent with our prior expectations across our footprint. We continue to expect consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 3% to 4% in 2021. In the U.S., as Tom outlined earlier, we anticipate a prolonged period of strong growth driven by 5G related densification initiatives by the carriers as they roll out multiple spectrum bands. We continue to expect that gross new business activity will accelerate through the year and into 2022. Looking to Latin America, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be roughly 7% for the year. Despite some challenges around COVID trends in the region, carrier activity remains consistent as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments. In Africa, we expect to generate organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8%, driven primarily by spending on 4G deployments.  We are seeing especially strong growth in Nigeria where new business trends continue to inflect positively and where our contract structures with key tenants are supporting growth. As we move into the back of the year, we anticipate that Africa organic tenant billings growth will accelerate to above 9%.  In Europe, we continue to expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% for the full year and are seeing solid trends, particularly on the gross new business side. We\u2019re especially encouraged by what we are seeing in Germany, where organic tenant billings growth excluding churn hit 7% in Q1 for the first time. We expect positive new business trends to continue going forward as incumbent carriers accelerate their 5G initiatives and as a new tenant begins to roll out its network. Finally in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. While we believe we\u2019re in the very late stages of the consolidation process, we maintain our expectation that we will see elevated churn this year as the post-AGR environment sorts itself out. With that said, we remain optimistic that the long term growth trajectory in the market should be more favorable, particularly given that the structural framework of the wireless sector today is probably the most constructive it has been in the last decade. Moving to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of 9.6% despite about $30 million in negative translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Around $33 million in incrementally expected services gross margin, $3 million or so in net straight line favorability, and about $4 million in lower cash SG&A is enabling us to more than offset the FX headwinds. The services activity we are seeing is broad-based and spread across multiple tenants, and in our view another indication that U.S. network investment activity is in the early stages of a sustainable acceleration.  Turning to Slide 11, we are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of over 9% with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.25 per share. Services segment outperformance as well as about $13 million in net cash interest and cash tax favorability are driving this upside and enabling us to absorb about $25 million in unfavorable FX impact. On a per-share basis, we expect growth of 9% for the year and continue to drive towards our goal of delivering double-digit growth. Moving onto Slide 12, let\u2019s review our capital deployment expectations for 2021, which are broadly consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continuing focus on driving strong, sustainable growth in consolidated AFFO per share. Distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top capital allocation priority and we continue to expect to allocate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15% subject to our board\u2019s approval.  Regarding capex, we are raising our projections by $25 million at the midpoint due to some additional expected U.S. land investments and a modest increase in start-up capex internationally. On the acquisition front, we spent around $115 million in the first quarter and continue to expect to deploy over $9 billion for the Telxius transaction later this year.  As I mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress on the financing plan for our European business and our acquisition of the Telxius assets. This includes on the private capital front, where we continue to remain confident that we can bring in one or more high quality strategic counterparties to purchase minority stakes in our European business not only to help us finance the Telxius transaction but also to collaborate on future European expansion opportunities.  On the debt side of the equation, we continue to expect to take our net leverage up to the high five times range. Having completed a U.S. dollar denominated senior unsecured notes offering in Q1, we anticipate that other near term debt issuances are likely to be euro denominated. This is consistent with our expected material expansion of euro-based revenues in our business and will enable us to take advantage of highly attractive financing rates. Finally, any remaining funding need that isn\u2019t covered by debt issuances or private capital will be in the form of equity through a common equity issuance and/or a mandatory convertible preferred issuance. Our goal continues to be to fund this transaction in a way that is not only optimal from a capital structure perspective but also enables us to optimize shareholder return. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on our new build program, which has accelerated over the last few years to meet increasing demand for new sites by a number of our key international tenants. As you can see, since 2016 and including our expectations for this year, we will have added over 23,000 sites to our portfolio through new construction. In 2020, we built over 5,800 towers, a new American Tower record, and we\u2019re off to a great start in 2021, adding nearly 2,000 sites in our international markets for the quarter, a level of activity only exceeded by that of Q4 2020. Moving to the middle of the slide, you can see that we are seeing highly attractive returns on capital deployed towards new sites. In Q1, average day one new build NOI yields were around 12%. In our APAC region where we added over 1,300 sites, we saw highly attractive yields of around 15%, and in Africa where we added more than 500 sites, we averaged day one returns of over 10%. We\u2019re anticipating another record year of new builds in 2021 with 6,500 sites at the midpoint of our outlook. The majority of these deployments will be focused across these same APAC and Africa regions, where we expect to drive the most attractive new build returns and where the vast majority of new build activity is for investment grade anchor tenants. Looking beyond 2021, we expect this trend of increasing demand for incremental wireless infrastructure to continue as carriers in markets with fast growing populations and surging demand for mobile data work to enhance their networks. We believe that our existing global scale, track record of providing best-in-class service levels and strong relationships with MNOs place American Tower in a favorable position to act as a preferred partner for these large scale deployments. As such, we\u2019ll look to take advantage of the opportunity to continue growing our international portfolio by deploying capital for high return new build projects, and as Tom noted on last quarter\u2019s call, based on the demand we are seeing for new sites internationally, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next five years. Finally on Slide 14 and in summary, Q1 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, dividend growth, and strong new build activity. We were able to secure a transformational deal in Europe with the pending Telxius transaction, signed a value-additive long term MLA in the U.S., continued to enhance our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing, and remained focused on cost controls and driving sustainable recurring growth. We are excited about the global demand for tower space and look forward to making additional progress on many fronts through the rest of the year as we seek to deliver compelling total returns to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the Operator for Q&A. Sure Tom, that sounds great. Thanks Jonathan for the question. Hope you\u2019re doing well. From a high level in terms of our Telxius financing, our plan has not changed, and we continue to make very good progress on the path that we originally announced, when we announced that we were entering into the transaction itself. There\u2019s a few broad principles that we\u2019re looking for. One is we expect to finance this deal in a way that\u2019s consistent with our investment grade credit. That still is the focus. Our aim is to minimize the dilution of our current common stockholders, so continue to be focused on that as well, and we expect to finance this transaction in a way that supports it being immediately accretive, which is what we said early on and that\u2019s continuing to be our focus and our expectation here as we move forward. A couple of things in terms of the internal workings of the financing plan. I don\u2019t want to get into details around the governance and valuation and those sorts of things, but one thing I would say valuation-wise, it\u2019s very consistent with the valuation of what we\u2019re doing with Telxius. In terms of the minority stakes that we are selling, we\u2019re selling minority stakes potentially in our European business not just to Telxius, but we will be putting our legacy businesses, combining that with the Telxius assets, so one key point is we do expect our debt to come up to the high five times - we\u2019ve said that before, we\u2019re still very comfortable in that range, and we do believe that that\u2019s consistent with our investment grade credit rating. We\u2019ve had many discussions with the credit agencies and we do not expect any risk of downgrades or outlook changes, or anything from that perspective. Additionally, near term senior notes that we may issue in order to fund the Telxius transaction are likely to be denominated in euro currency, and that will allow us to take into the very attractive rates that we see in the euro market certainly.  Then on the private capital front, as Tom alluded to and I mentioned in comments, we continue to progress along that path, and we\u2019re very confident that we can bring in one or more very strategic investors. We certainly are talking to the world\u2019s premier investors and certainly folks that understand this base, that understand the European market and other markets, quite frankly, as well as have relationships with some of our biggest customers around the globe, so there may be more than just financial benefits here to our shareholders but also strategic and kind of broader partnership benefits as well. Certainly that\u2019s a key focus. Then the final piece of the financing plan will come in the form of equity, so whatever is not funded through the increased net leverage that I talked about and through the euro debt offerings and private capital, we expect to go into the market and issue some equity.  In terms of timing, we do expect the transaction to begin to close in the second quarter probably as early as late May for some of the European markets. The Latin American markets, we\u2019re originally expecting that they would close probably sometime in Q3. There is a chance that Brazil and some of the other markets could close as early as the end of May or at some point in Q2, but we\u2019ll continue to work through the timing there. There will be some assets, particularly some select rooftops that will close in Europe in Q3, not in Q2, so we will have multiple closings across Q2 and across Q3. That\u2019s kind of the way that it shakes out, and again we remain very confident that this financing plan and our patience in putting it together and managing through the details I really going to pay off for our shareholders, and we\u2019re in very good shape to begin to execute on this in the month of May as we prepare to close the first tranches of the Telxius transaction. Yes, thanks Tom. Thanks Matt, hope you\u2019re doing well. Thanks for the question. With regards to our services business, as you saw in the comments earlier and I think Tom alluded to it, we are seeing a significant uplift in our services revenue for the year, so you saw us raise our full-year outlook to about $175 million, up from about $120 million. The margins are broadly consistent year over year, so we\u2019re expecting that mid to just a touch above mid 50% margins - that\u2019s similar to what we saw in 2020, that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting in 2021.  In terms of the timing of the services revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of, let\u2019s say, applications and activity in the market, and we expect that to continue throughout the next couple of quarters, so more than 60% of the revenue of the $175 million is back-end weighted, so we would expect in Q3 and Q4, both of those periods would be north of $50 million per quarter in terms of revenue. That\u2019s kind of the way to think about services. Services, what we\u2019re seeing really is kind of a broad-based increase in services that goes across most all of our large customers, certainly, and it\u2019s focused on [indiscernible] engineering, miles analysis, things like that. Those sorts of activities are generally kind of front-end loaded. That services work happens well before you see leasing activity and any kind of an uplift in leasing revenue, so it\u2019s a really good sign here in terms of the activity level, the services that we see kind of ramping up towards the end of this year and as we transition into 2022.  When you think about India and bad debt, there\u2019s still a few places where we\u2019re watching customers around the globe, a couple in Africa and a couple in India certainly. We\u2019re doing really well. There\u2019s no significant incremental bad debt in our outlook, and our accounts receivable, the way it sits at the end of Q1 is broadly in line with the way that it sat at the end of Q1 last year, so we haven\u2019t had a significant increase in accounts receivable. We continue to collect and be pleased with the way that our customers are paying in India and in the select places in Africa that we\u2019re watching. We did end up unwinding a bad debt reserve in India in Q1 by just under $10 million or so, so that\u2019s certainly a good sign; but with that said, we continue to watch India. There\u2019s a few things that we\u2019re looking for relative to some of our customers there in terms of capital raise projects that they\u2019re in, and certainly the amount of liabilities through the AGR and some of the activity between our customers and the government to try to negotiate those, we watch that quite closely. But that\u2019s really the story on accounts receivable and bad debt, but we\u2019ve had a good quarter, we did well throughout 2020, and we don\u2019t have any significant incremental bad debt in our outlook for 2021. Yes, thanks for the questions, Batya. I\u2019ll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I miss anything, just remind me. Maybe I\u2019ll start at the end and work backwards a little bit. The escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for Q1 was about 2.6% - that really was driven by the impact of timing mechanics within the T-Mobile MLA, so as we signed a new MLA with T-Mobile, the escalator shifted from one period to another, and that affected the volume of escalator in Q1. But for the full year, we do expect the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above potentially, and Q2 we do expect the escalator for the U.S. to be 3.1%. There\u2019s no structural change, there\u2019s no permanent shift, it really is just a timing issue.  I\u2019ll also point out, it\u2019s a little ahead of time, but in 2022 you may see some lumpiness as well with the escalator, given the time shift here, but again for 2022 for the full year, we anticipate the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above as usual, so nothing to be concerned there. We haven\u2019t had any philosophy shift and no kind of contractual change in terms of what the escalator is. It remains at 3%, as it always has in the U.S. Then I think your next question was relative to the long term guidance, and maybe I\u2019ll just take a minute to remind the folks on the call of what that is. We\u2019re looking at over the next seven years, we\u2019ve put out guidance at least 4% organic tenant billings growth on average over that time period. That includes the Sprint churn, which will begin to roll off of our billing later this year in Q4, in the beginning of October. If you normalize for that, we\u2019re looking at that long term organic growth rate in the U.S. of about 5%. The other thing that I would point out here is if you look at just the first couple years, \u201921 and \u201922 on a Sprint impacted basis, where we\u2019ll see that churn again beginning in Q4 of 2021, the expected organic tenant billings including that will be around 2%, but normalizing that it will be around 5%. Once we get clear from that, when we get out to \u201923 and beyond, so \u201923 out to \u201927, even with the impact of the Sprint churn, we\u2019re predicting organic tenant billings growth north of 5%, and on a normalized basis for that same time period north of about 6%, so we are very excited and confident about the future in the U.S. We are seeing an acceleration of gross new biz. We\u2019re seeing that today, we expect that to continue, and that really is fueling these very solid organic tenant billings predictions over a long period of time - again, that seven years. Just a couple of key components here. I\u2019d remind you, 23% or two thirds of this, two thirds of this revenue that we need to hit these things are already contracted in our long term agreements and in some of these holistic deals, so that\u2019s key. That includes Dish being in here in the assumptions with some modest activity, which potentially could outperform depending on the pace and the level of their network build over that time period. Some of the C-band spectrum deployments for some carriers in some of the years may be in addition here and outside of the traditional holistics, so we\u2019re looking to that potentially as an upside. Then in terms of the collocation amendment mix, we\u2019re currently still at heavy amendment, 80% and 20% collocation - that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for a little while. It may vary from carrier to carrier, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s been consistently, and we expect that that will be the case for a couple years. But going out longer term, it will vary. We do expect that it could be a higher percentage of collocations than we\u2019ve traditionally seen as the carriers deploy this higher band spectrum and they have a need to densify their network builds over time, so we\u2019re certainly planning for some of that as well but it\u2019s probably too early to predict that with too much specificity in terms of what that would be in terms of the mix in the out years. Was there another piece in your question, Batya, that I didn\u2019t address? Yes, the Dish MLA has the 3% in there, so the escalator is consistent with everything else that we do and consistent with our philosophy here in the U.S. Then in terms of timing of the revenues, I\u2019ll just maybe highlight for folks that we do expect revenue to begin in 2022, and it will be modest in that year and then it will ramp up going forward, and we\u2019ll be working with Dish to help them roll out their network over an extended period of time. You\u2019re welcome. Thanks everyone."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks Igor. Good morning everyone.  As is typical in our first quarter call, the focus of my comments today will be on our foundational U.S. business, which represented nearly 58% of our total property revenue and more than two thirds of our consolidated property segment operating profit in Q1 while accounting for about three quarters of our $60 billion in contractually committed revenue. The overall NOI yield of our U.S. property segment now stands at 11.5% [indiscernible] the portfolio for at least 10 years, generating more than 20%. These metrics reflect our long track record of driving strong, profitable, recurring cash flow growth in the U.S., and we remain confident in our ability to extend that track record long into the future. This confidence is inspired not only by the exceptional visibility we have into our long-term organic growth rate through our existing comprehensive master lease agreement, but also due to a number of favorable industry trends that we expect to drive our business forward. These trends in large part center on our customers\u2019 5G network deployments, which we expect to meaningfully accelerate over the next several years giving rise to a more developed 5G world. On the demand side of the equation, mobile data usage growth shows no signs of slowing. The average smartphone user in the U.S. is currently consuming more than 15 gigabits per month and is expected to be using more than 50 gigabits on a monthly basis by 2026, reflecting a CAGR of nearly 30%. The proliferation of value-added streaming services, mobile video conferencing, and other content-rich bandwidth intensive applications continues to stress existing 4G wireless networks, creating the need for more material additional network capital investments, and emerging AR and VR applications and other next gen capabilities are contributing virtually nothing to mobile data usage today given the limited coverage and low 5G device penetration, but we don\u2019t think that will be the case for long. The 5G network revolution is under way and it\u2019s quite possible, perhaps even likely the current growth projections for U.S. mobile data usage will prove to be conservative, much like what we\u2019ve seen in the past. The development of 5G-related, low-latency applications and services, additional growth from enterprise accounts, and even fixed wireless applications in the home could all drive usage much higher over time. We expect that the increased availability of spectrum in the marketplace, particularly on the midband side, will help enable this usage growth going forward. Spectrum has always been the lifeblood of the wireless industry, and given the capacity necessary to provide users a true 5G experience, it is more important today than ever before. Particularly significant in our view are midband spectrum assets like 2.5 Gig and the newly acquired C-band frequencies as they provide our customers with a crucial middle ground between the attractive propagation characteristics of low band spectrum and the deep capacity characteristics of higher band. We believe the results of the most recently completed C-band auction underscore the importance of this spectrum to our customers as they look to monetize the benefits of 5G. Importantly, as the carriers emphasized in their public comments after the auction, we expect this spectrum to be deployed quickly. The wireless industry is in a strong financial position and numerous steps have been taken by the carriers to not only fund the upfront purchase price of the spectrum but also to effectively deploy it. In fact, we are already seeing sizeable increases in activity in our own services segment, and consistent with our long-term outlook expectations, we expect to see higher levels of gross new business in our property segment beginning later this year, particularly in \u201922 and beyond. Part of this uptick in activity is in rural areas as stimulus funds from the government support smaller companies to effectively deploy wireless internet services, and as the major operators continue to fill in the white spaces in their network. The deployment of fixed wireless for households around the country using midband spectrum, as our customers are planning, could also provide further opportunities for us going forward. Taking all of these factors into account, we believe we have a highly attractive, long-term monetization opportunity in front of us as the carriers further densify their networks and add more equipment to existing lease sites to support their incremental capacity needs. A significant portion of this growth is locked into our existing contractual relationships. Other components of the growth may be more variable. Either way, we expect to see higher levels of activity in the marketplace accompanied by increasing wireless capex spend. On this point, analysts are projecting more than $35 billion in average annual capital spending from our customers over the next several years, which would represent industry record. With that in perspective, that average annual rate is more than double what the carriers spent back when 2G was actually deployed. While each of our customers have slightly different strategies to deploy 5G, we are confident that they will be successful in doing so. We also believe that our macro tower oriented U.S. portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to benefit from these accelerating deployments. Macro sites continue to be by far the most cost effective RF-efficient network engineering option and are also optimally located to help deliver coverage and capacity for hundreds of millions of people nationwide. As a result, we continue to believe that the vast majority of midband deployments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future will be on macro towers, and as our network infrastructure was ideally suited for our customers\u2019 needs for 2G, 3G, and 4G, and we have no reason to believe that 5G will be any different. What we do expect to be unique to 5G is the added use of massive MIMO technology for midband spectrum deployments on our macro towers, which should provide operators with more dynamic coverage and capacity capabilities. The race to nationwide 5G with the use of massive MIMO will require more fiber connections to antennas, increased DC power, and enough capacity to accommodate the size and weight of these more intelligent RF solutions. To prepare for these requirements, we have been proactively investing in more efficient and scalable power solutions at many of our sites. We\u2019ve also upgraded the capacity of many of our tower structures over the last decade, installed energy efficient LED lighting on many sites, and invested in site hardening initiatives where appropriate. Simply put, we stand ready to service our customers as they accelerate their 5G deployments. Importantly, macro sites may even be more critical today given the incremental density networks will require to support a 5G architecture, and because only one of our existing tenants is on more than half of our sites today, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive incremental lease-up at and capacity utilization as densification initiatives ramp up. As has been our experience, we would expect that roughly $0.90 of every dollar we generate from this organic leasing activity will flow straight to the bottom line. As a result, we expect to continue to drive strong operating leverage in the business along with modest capital intensity, reflecting two of the hallmarks of our last several decades [indiscernible]. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate strong operating profit margins, including more than 78% in 2021. All of these factors contribute to our confidence in our ability to drive average annual U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth of at least 5% in 2027, normalized for the sprint churn impact, and at least 6% from \u201923 to \u201927 specifically calculated on the same basis. Importantly, more than two-thirds of this growth is now contractually locked in, given the signing of our MLA with Dish in the first quarter. Embedded with these expectations is the assumption that our portfolio of wireless towers will be our fastest growing asset, as has been the case over the last five years, and our organic tenant billings growth was an average of roughly 40 basis points higher than our overall U.S. metrics. This resilient trend, in our view, was another point of validation that macro tower will continue to be the focal point of modern wireless networks, generating the best economics across the telecommunications real estate universe.  Going forward, we expect these economics to get even better. Margins will benefit from densification driven leasing activity and continued amendments, while costs will remain largely fixed and capital intensity should continue to be low. Existing leases will escalate at historical rates of at least 3% and normal course churn should be quite modest, likely trending down over time particularly once we work through the Sprint cancellations over the next few years. We intend to remain laser focused on maximizing our sustainable cash flow growth from these fundamental 5G drivers.  We also believe that the economics of our U.S. business and specifically of our macro tower sites can be further enhanced through the implementation of collective platform expansion initiatives. Chief among them is edge compute, which is starting to come into clear view as true 5G becomes a reality for consumers, and perhaps even more importantly for the enterprise segment. We expect the key drivers of demand for edge compute solutions to be the emerging need for incremental Cloud-RAN locations and lower latency applications processing in a 5G environment. As more and more data processing evolves to the network edge to support those needs, we anticipate that new micro edge data center architecture will be necessary to complement the existing regional framework. Select locations within our nationwide macro tower asset base, which by definition are at the mobile network edge, are positioned to play a meaningful role in this evolution. The underlying thesis supporting this belief is the concept that, as it has been for the last two decades in the deployment of wireless networks, shared neutral host infrastructure will be the most cost effective and efficient way to rapidly deploy cloud-native 5G applications at scale. Given that our attractively located tower sites have existing access to fiber and power while already hosting multiple communications providers, they are a natural candidate to represent hub locations for these low latency wireless edge data centers.  Scale deployment of a true mobile edge remains several years away, but in our view the TAM could be quite significant, running well into the billions of dollars annually. In the meantime, we have some half dozen ongoing small scale distributed commute trials at our tower sites, creating a beachhead to larger scale true mobile edge deployments. Additionally, our Colo Atl facility continues to outperform our expectations and we are having meaningful conversations with a number of key stakeholders across the data center and cloud sectors regarding the optimal requirements for the 5G edge. As we\u2019ve noted previously, we intend to explore global joint ventures or partnerships to effectively leverage these inherent opportunities, and we continue to work through a number of different scenarios on that front. The early data points we are seeing throughout the industry all suggest that this can be a meaningful, scalable opportunity that can represent solid upside for us in due time, and we are devoting resources internally to ensure that we are in a position to be opportunistic and agile. In the context of the long term outlook we discussed last quarter, we believe that mobile edge compute could eventually represent meaningful potential upside. Having said that, we are going to remain disciplined from a capital deployment perspective, as you would expect. Recurring revenue, strong long term growth prospects, healthy ROIC and an attractive margin profile are all prerequisites for us to deploy meaningful capital anywhere, and that includes our efforts on the platform expansion side. Our preliminary assessments indicate that the edge opportunity fits nicely into our framework, but we will need to prove out this thesis going forward.  Taking into account the strong underlying baseline growth path we have in the U.S. for the next decade, we are in a position to be thoughtful, deliberate and strategic with these types of initiatives. Additionally, while we are laser focused on driving incremental value in the U.S., we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy capital internationally where high quality, scaled macro tower portfolios are likely to come to market, and while my comments today are focused on our U.S. operation and marketplace, the exact same approach can be duplicated globally. Whether it\u2019s growth, platform expansion opportunities, or margin expansion, the messages globally are identical. With our roughly 220,000 sites pro forma for the Telxius acquisition, we have an unmatched presence in some of the fastest growing wireless broadband markets - period, and we can offer to a number of different parties a one-stop capability that is second to none. While we would expect to expand the depth of this presence over time so as not to be complacent, we believe that it already gives us a significant competitive advantage As we have always done on a global basis, we will be seeking to maximize long term growth in AFFO per share while maintaining attractive returns on invested capital. We also continue to invest in our people, our systems and processes and remain focused on numerous ESG initiatives while dedicating ourselves to ensuring a diverse and inclusive culture throughout the company. To summarize, I want to reiterate our excitement about the U.S. market. We are in the very early stages of a transformation period in U.S. wireless technology, one that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we live, work and play while opening up tremendous new possibilities across numerous industries. Our extensive portfolio of communications real estate across the country sits at the cross-section of the elements that can make this transformation a reality, and as a result we are positioned to drive compelling long term stockholder returns while continuing to provide industry-leading service levels to both existing and new customers. Finally, I want to recognize our nearly 6,000 employees around the world who are working tirelessly for all of us. Achieving the types of results Rod is going to walk you through now, particularly through this horrific pandemic, is really remarkable, and I want them to know just how much we all appreciate their dedication and hard work. With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated outlook. Rod? Hey Simon. Thanks Simon, thanks for the question. You know, we\u2019ve been looking at the European market for the better part of a dozen years, and we did create a couple beachhead properties, if you will, in France and Germany, pretty small, in kind of the 4,000 to 5,000 sites a number of years ago, and we\u2019ve continued to look in those particular markets to see if there are opportunities. One of the challenges that we always saw in those markets were who the counterparty was, what the capital would be that required to upgrade the sites themselves, and really what were the long-term growth projections and opportunities in the marketplace, and so as such, we were never successful in terms of kind of landing any particular transactions up until the transaction that we\u2019re just about ready to close with Telxius. A lot of that is a function of the relationship, I think, that we\u2019ve built with Telefonica over so many years and have--you know, they have such credibility, and I think we have a lot of credibility with them. We were able to put our hands on this particular portfolio, and I think in particular for those very reasons that I mentioned before that got in the way of us being able to close things, is that the portfolio itself is very solid, it\u2019s a terrific set of assets, terrifically located, as I said good counterparty, and now what we\u2019re starting to see in the marketplace, as Rod talked about, was really the evolution of 5G. We\u2019re starting to see more spectrum being deployed to support 5G and we\u2019re really, I think, just on the front end of what that 5G deployment is going to look like. We see it accelerating particularly in markets like Germany, and we see the opportunity for a new entrant who is going to be coming into the marketplace, and so we think it really rounds out our overall portfolio. I think we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have a presence in so many different -- very, very important markets around the globe, and this just increases the overall presence we have and what was kind of a hole, if you will, in our portfolio given the size of the assets that we had before. And so now, we\u2019re going to have 30,000 sites in the marketplace, terrific counterparty, and as I said right in the beginning part of what we think is going to be a long-term growth trajectory in the region, and so we\u2019ll use that as a way to be able to continue to grow if it makes sense and if we find good assets, good opportunities in the region. I think we\u2019re positioning ourselves with some very interesting private capital, and so that will increase the overall platform for our ability to grow in the market. I mean, they\u2019re very passive - we\u2019re operating it. They\u2019re minority partners, as you would expect, but they are very interested also in growing their portfolios in our base of assets, and hopefully they\u2019ll be able to participate in future potential investments with us.  I think that this is all coming together quite nicely for us, and we\u2019ve received the approvals to be able to move forward with the transaction in all due respects, and so we\u2019re excited about what the region has in front of us. As I said, equally as important, we\u2019re excited now about what that brings to our overall global footprint and how important that could be to TSBs, hyper scalers, who knows who might be looking for kind of a one-stop shop, if you will, in looking at our over 200,000 sites in these key markets, and we look to continue to grow that. Rod talked about the 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that we\u2019re looking at, and so we very much have our sights on increasing our footprint globally, and I think this is a great step. Hey Ric. It very well may, Ric. You know, we\u2019ve had JV partners in the form of MNOs in the past, as you well know - with MTN, who were a great partner, and it very well may. We\u2019ll look at it on a case-by-case basis and look at the opportunities. We think we have a good playbook, if you will, that we\u2019ve created as a result of the work that we\u2019ve done on this particular transaction, and there\u2019s definitely a lot of interest, and so we\u2019ll look at that as perhaps the means to create a broader platform for our ability to grow. So, it\u2019s very possible, and as you know, we\u2019ll look at everything on an individual basis, a case-by-case basis. I think that\u2019s probably a better question for them in terms of what they\u2019re actually looking for. They recently, though, have executed a roaming agreement with Telefonica, so they have a very strong relationship, I think, with TEF in the market, which we\u2019ll then be able to hopefully take advantage of. I think that will unfold over the year as they\u2019ve said publicly, in terms of putting that all together. They are looking to roll out 5G, urban markets first, and so this is where our rooftop penetration, rooftop assets in that market as we\u2019ve talked about has just been so incredibly valuable, and that\u2019s a particular asset base that we just didn\u2019t have before. We were quite rural in terms of the portfolio we had before, so this really takes it up a few notches in terms of our ability to be successful in the marketplace, and my sense is they will take advantage of the rooftop assets probably out of the gate. Well, as you know, Ric, we already have a long term master lease agreement in place with Verizon, and so it wasn\u2019t one where it needed to be extended from that perspective. We have a terrific relationship with Verizon. We\u2019re in conversations with them, I\u2019m in conversations with them on quite a regular basis, not just on this but on a lot of broader issues in the marketplace, and so we have a holistic rate that we have right now with them that expires at the end of the year, and that\u2019s just one element of this broader, long term master lease agreement with the, and whether that continues or not, who knows, but we\u2019re, I think, providing excellent service for Verizon. They are being very aggressive on rollout of 5G and C-band, and we\u2019ll be there every step of the way for them. Well, it is a goal. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s aspirational or whatever, whatever word you want, but my compensation is driven on AFFO per share growth and return on invested capital, and our shareholders require that too, so we very much have an objective of that double-digit.  Now, it\u2019s not going to happen maybe in every year, it\u2019s long term, but we\u2019ve been able to be very successful in terms of driving that kind of performance over the last 10 years and we\u2019re very focused on continually driving to that kind of performance going forward. 2022, you know, we do have the churn impact associated with the Sprint assets, so could that be a challenge? Perhaps, but our goal is still the same, so I think we have a number of levers. We\u2019re going to be bringing on the Telxius assets, which I think we\u2019ll be very happy with those results and what that kind of accretion should be to take advantage of the markets, and we\u2019ll have our normal solid growth that we see going on in the business. We just increased our overall EBITDA performance for 2021, and so we\u2019ll remain laser focused on all of our costs, including all of our capital being spent. Again, our goal is to drive that kind of performance. You too, Ric. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Rod to address the first question and I\u2019ll take the second one, John. Then John, with regard to your second question with where we are with fiber as one of our platform extension initiatives, first of all where we are, we have a six country fiber footprint - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, SA and India, and we cover over 30,000 route kilometres. We actually passed 1.25 million homes in those markets, and the networks themselves are a mix of active long haul, metro, some B2B in Mexico and Brazil, and a concentration of fiber to passive optical networks in SA, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina.  We\u2019ve spent just over a billion dollars of capex over the past four years in those markets - $700 million for acquisitions and $300 million for development and redevelopment capex, so we\u2019ve been monitoring it very closely. From a revenue perspective, I think we generated about $100 million in 2020, and our ROIC for those particular investments collectively is in kind of the 5%, 5.5% kind of range. Interesting, the SA assets, the return on invested capital is probably double that.  So what we\u2019re thinking about strategically, again we\u2019re looking at this from an initiative perspective, a platform initiative perspective. Some of the underlying elements of it, the foundations of it, again go back to how we\u2019re looking at the overall tower model - multi service, multi tenant, long term anchor contract, escalators, exclusive real estate rights, a way for us to really be able to create a competitive advantage and really complement the power returns that we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last 10 years or so.  Our strategy really has kind of two prongs. I would say the first is to pivot and transform our current fiber businesses in Mexico and Brazil into wholesale long term contracts. We\u2019ll be looking to do this through long term contracts with Tier 1 carriers, also could involve some strategic inorganic transactions like we were just talking about before, and the focus is clearly creating a competitive, long term strategic asset in those markets. Then the second strategy really entails reaching certain economics in these deployments, particularly in SA and Brazil, and a focus on future investments in some of our emerging neutral host open access networks. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic where it obviously makes sense, be monitoring it very closely, but we do see that we\u2019ll see kind of a shift to open passive optical and multi-tenant access networks over time - we think that\u2019s a great way to be able to improve the return on invested capital, and our regional focus is currently right now on Latin America where most of the assets are and leveraging our existing M&O relationships. We think we can create that model in LatAm and then be able to scale it globally. I mean, that\u2019s kind of where we are. It\u2019s still a work in progress, but I think we\u2019ve learned a lot and I think we\u2019re making great progress on the strategy. Yes Matt, I\u2019ll let Rod get into that. Sure Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start off and Rod can chime in with some additional commentary. What we\u2019re seeing around the globe, as I think both Rod and I mentioned even in our remarks, was just an onslaught of new spectrum coming into the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing in India, we\u2019re seeing clearly in Europe, we\u2019re seeing in Latin America, and they\u2019re wide blocks of spectrum. For 5G to be effective, you need a wider swath of spectrum. It can\u2019t be the 10 meg - you know, you\u2019re looking at 20 to 40 to 60 meg of spectrum, and so that\u2019s the first sign, I think David, that we see because, as I mentioned and as you well know, spectrum is the lifeblood of being able to roll out any of these new technologies, and for 5G to be able to truly realize the full 5G experience in terms of speed and latency, you need significant amounts of it. I look at--and in my comment before on Europe, what we\u2019ve seen in certain of those critical markets, critical countries in Europe really stepping up to launching a lot of new spectrum, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re really now starting to see some outsized growth in those particular markets, something that we hadn\u2019t seen for several years, and that really drove us to looking at some of the growth curves in that market for us to even lean into some of the assets that are there. That\u2019s just kind of the first sign of it, I think. You know, you look at markets like Africa, though - I mean, Africa--I think Rod had mentioned they were kind of in the 8%, looking at growing to 9%, even kind of ending out the year. You look at markets like Nigeria and things like that, where we\u2019re talking kind of double-digit growth rates - that\u2019s just because the wire line presence there just doesn\u2019t exist, and wireless broadband is everything that our customers are investing in, so you have slightly different reasons for some of the growth. Many of the markets are just getting into 4G, so we\u2019re still on the front of that 4G curve, and Latin America, you look at Brazil growth, you look at Mexico growth, they\u2019re in kind of the 7%, 8% growth range, so we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019re seeing outside of the United States, and what\u2019s really driving it clearly is more spectrum, more wireless penetration. Unfortunately, the pandemic has actually driven even more of a need for connectivity, and so we\u2019re seeing even more wireless usage in those markets in particular, again because the wire line markets are just so poor and non-existent.  We would expect to see Europe kicking in with 5G, Africa continued growth as 4G becomes more of a reality there, Latin America similarly 4G into 5G ultimately, and even in India, the growth there is strong. We\u2019ve got the churn issues that we have to deal with in that particular market and we\u2019re getting our arms around it and making sure that we really nail those there, but it\u2019s not a growth issue. They\u2019ve got new spectrum, they\u2019ve got 4G, you see the likes of Facebook, you see all of the big foreign investment that\u2019s coming into the marketplace, so it\u2019s really an exciting market from a broadband wireless perspective. That kind of gives it on a global scale, and from a supply chain perspective, we don\u2019t see any impacts on our side from a supply chain perspective at this point. Our customers are the ones that are kind of front line with issues that they may have from some of the OEMs and things like that, but at least from our perspective, we\u2019re not seeing any impact from that perspective. Okay. Let me take a step back a little bit. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing from an evolution perspective, if you will, first of all, this whole market is in fact developing. With regards specific to the edge, we are at the beginning and we\u2019re seeing certain elements align, if you will, but we\u2019re really starting to and trying to participate in those, but we really are at the beginning of it. If you start to think about, first of all, the [indiscernible] impact, what the cloud impact is, we just saw some recent announcements in the market relative to cloud layers aligning with some of the MNOs and we\u2019ve seen Verizon doing that over the last year or so, what we\u2019re starting to see is if you think about kind of the 4G low, midband power market and what it looks like at the site level, as we move into the 5G and lowband, midband, what we\u2019re starting to see at the site, for example, is a lot of--you know, MIMO is going to be starting to be deployed, a lot of antenna arrays, a lot of new fiber that\u2019s going up the pole themselves, five to 10 times more fiber strands needed, higher power, more heat, and so there\u2019s a lot of elements that are going on actually at the site itself, which is going to drive more and more equipment improvements to the public radio interface on the front hole which connects, actually, the tower to the base band unit itself. Now what we\u2019re starting to see is we\u2019re seeing Cloud-RAN and O-RAN. From an O-RAN perspective, it\u2019s different types of equipment that our customers are able to put together to be able to load onto the site, and at the base level, at the base band unit, which is where the data center element comes in, we\u2019re starting to see a disaggregation at the base band unit level into the DU and into the CU level, and that\u2019s giving our customers the ability and us to be able to look at where in fact we might be able to expand and be able to enjoy some of this additional compute capability that\u2019s going to exist out at the edge as the 5G experience becomes more prevalent throughout the country. We continue and expect to see this incremental convergence of this wire line and wireless network. We think it stresses the importance of that first mile network architecture, and so as a result we\u2019re actually very, very excited about the opportunity. It\u2019s a shared neutral host solution, we think it\u2019s going to be very efficient out at the site level, and we actually are exploring and going down the path of really two elements, two ways if you will. We\u2019ve talked about the distribute compute. You know, the enterprise workloads continue to move onto the public cloud, and so there\u2019s a growing near term market segment that\u2019s in use of that kind of off-prem cloud computing, it\u2019s really a hybrid solution, and so we\u2019re located on some [indiscernible], if you will, of our sites and you\u2019ll see them - there are shelters there, there\u2019s power, there\u2019s capability to be able to offer this kind of a capability to these kind of midsized enterprise accounts, and they\u2019re actually being quite successful. They\u2019re loading up very quickly and, believe me, they\u2019re not meaningful from an AMT perspective but they are absolutely meaningful from an experience perspective and learning exactly what our customers are going to be looking for. The bigger opportunity for us is still at the mobile edge compute side, and so that will become, we believe, more of a reality as that 5G world becomes more developed, so we have a number of MOUs with a number of different players focused on solutions to the MNOs, as well as focused on solutions to the cloud service providers. We\u2019re exploring those, putting those in front of those particular accounts and looking at what the ultimate opportunity would be, and the site is a perfect location for being able to expand our customers\u2019 edge compute capability, not just within the United States but on a global basis. If we can bring in 500 kilowatts of power into a particular site with a number of shelters that exist in the site to be able to load up racks and servers, we think--and give that cloud ramp, which will actually exist in that DU, so that\u2019s why that disaggregation is so important between those two particular elements of the RAN, we think that we can enjoy some significant opportunity upside here from this whole initiative. It is an extension of our existing platform - again, neutral host, but it really provides ultimately that cloud ramp which we think is going to be needed to be able to enjoy that kind of latency that our enterprise accounts and customers are going to be looking for. Yes, I think that the build itself--you know, our plan, our outlook I think has been the 6,000 to 7,000 sites. There could be some timing issues associated with the build. The need is there, I\u2019m certain that the sites are going to be built, but particularly in a market like India who are suffering so significantly right now, there can be a timing issue in terms of having essential people out in the marketplace to be able to build. Clearly lives saved is more important than towers built, so there could be some timing issues there, but ultimately over that five-year period, we are seeing the demand for that 40,000 to 50,000 sites that Rod laid out, and our forecast right now is for that 6,000 to 7,000 sites, there could be some timing issues associated with particularly the sites in India. I\u2019m not seeing the same implications in Africa at this point in time. By the way, our overall 6,000 to 7,000 sites, that outlook already includes some carving back of what we are expecting overall in the marketplace.  Relative to COVID overall, as we\u2019ve seen over the last year, our business is quite resilient. People need connectivity - I think that\u2019s been more obvious than ever over this past year, particularly in many of our global markets, and so our customers are doing everything possible that they can to be able to maintain that kind of connectivity. We\u2019re doing everything we possibly can to be able to support them, to be able to ensure that kind of connectivity, so we\u2019re working our tails off with our customers to make sure that we can do that.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our strategy; and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2022 results and 2023 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Five years ago, when we rolled out the Stand and Deliver strategy that would guide us over the following decade, we emphasized driving the business forward through four key pillars: enhancing operational efficiency, growing our assets and capabilities, investing in innovation and platform extensions and augmenting industry leadership. Since that time, we've seen carriers across our global footprint invest over $300 billion in network assets and methodically deploy next-generation networks to support rapidly increasing data demand in their served markets. Our commitment to execute on each pillar of Stand and Deliver, not only aligns with our customers' needs in this context, but it also enhances American Tower's position to serve as a strategic provider of critical infrastructure for the networks of the future. So before highlighting the key strategic objectives, we'll focus on in 2023 and over the next several years, I'd like to spend a moment reviewing achievements from the past five years that have driven our success to date. On the operational front, we've signed comprehensive master lease agreements with T-Mobile, AT&T, DISH and most recently, Verizon in the United States. These agreements represent a commitment to a mutually beneficial, predictable growth path and strategic alignment between American Tower and its customers, while also demonstrating the value and criticality of our nationwide 43,000-plus site portfolio to support 4G, 5G and future network generations. Such agreements also bring with them efficiency innovations designed to deliver simplicity in leasing processes and accelerated time to market for the carriers. To extend on these benefits, we've invested in technologies to build a holistic standardized data set, mapping the vast majority of our US assets, which can be leveraged to eventually bring application cycle times down to a matter of hours. We believe this type of capability will be a particularly attractive customer value proposition in the context of a 5G densification cycle and one we believe can be scaled across our global footprint over time. Our focus on operational efficiency has extended throughout our international business as well. Notably, since the beginning of 2018, we've invested nearly $350 million, primarily in Africa, on improving site level performance through our Power as a Service program. This includes the installation of lithium-ion batteries and solar arrays for primary and backup power delivery, which has resulted in a sizable reduction in average fuel consumption per site across our African portfolio and has extended the replacement cycles of critical power sources all while providing over a 99.9% average uptime for our customers' networks. At the same time, we've established a centralized procurement organization that aims to drive down material costs. And we've leveraged shared best practices and our scale as a multi-national operator to strengthen our global vendor relationships. By streamlining these critical operational functions, we've been able to continue to drive solid investment returns on our capital deployments and efficiently meet the infrastructure needs of our customers, all against a challenging backdrop of price volatility and supply chain disruptions. In fact, since the start of 2018, we've added nearly 26,000 sites to our international portfolio through new builds, more than two times the volume of the previous five-year period. Today, these sites are contributing approximately $250 million in tower cash flow and an NOI yield of approximately 21%, demonstrating meaningful expansion from the already attractive low double-digit day one yields we typically see on these new build opportunities. On the M&A front, we've executed a number of transactions that have been transformational in terms of delivering additional critical scale in existing and new markets ahead of major network investment cycle, the benefits of which we are seeing in our results and forward-looking expectations today. These include InSite in the United States, the in portfolio in Africa as well as Telxius in Europe and Latin America, which augmented our scale in Germany and provided entry to Spain in a leadership position just as 5G investments were beginning to ramp up on the continent. More recently, through our efforts to selectively expand our platform and position American Tower as a market leader in the next generation of network architecture development, we entered the data center space through the acquisition of CoreSite. CoreSite delivers an interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich platform as well as exposure to a resilient high-demand communications infrastructure business, which we believe will deliver strong performance as demonstrated by a record signed new business in 2022 and provide accretive returns on a standalone basis over time. As importantly, we believe the combination of CoreSite and American Towers platform of distributed tower real estate positions us to enhance the value of our existing assets as the edge proliferates. Finally, I'm particularly proud of the steps we've made towards augmenting our leadership in several areas. Organizationally, we've made ESG core to our operations through initiatives such as our commitment to Science-Based Targets, localized DE&I initiatives designed to facilitate an inclusive organization for our employees and stakeholders and through the growth of our digital communities program, which has now reached more than 400 communities and serves more than 335,000 people across 15 countries. As I mentioned on this call last year, we're also a member of the EDISON Alliance: 1 Billion Lives Challenge, which provides us the opportunity to contribute to the development of affordable and accessible digital healthcare, finance and education solutions for communities in need. Over the past year, we've developed partnerships with healthcare providers that have resulted in the launch of several telehealth locations that provide primary, preventative and specialty teleconsultation services in underserved areas. While this is just one positive first step, we believe that we've achieved over the last year, clearly demonstrates the value we can create and the communities we serve through a commitment to multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. And we hope more organizations will join us in efforts like these over the coming years, which brings us to today and our focus for 2023 and beyond. We believe we're poised to build on and accelerate the successes of Stand and Deliver that we've achieved thus far. As I mentioned in the opening, our teams are focused on key strategic objectives that will continue to guide our operations and management teams in American Tower over the next several years. The first of these is to leverage our premier platform of assets to drive strong recurring growth, both organically and through our disciplined capital allocation framework and our investment-grade balance sheet, as we seek to capture new business opportunities against the backdrop of secular demand trends that remain as strong as ever. We refer to this internally as scale the core. To this end, we expect an acceleration in organic growth in 2023, representing an improvement of around 100 basis points relative to our prior five-year average. Beginning with our US and Canada segment, the benefits of our comprehensive MLAs and ongoing 5G deployments are driving an expectation for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% in 2023, including approximately $220 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growth, which would be a record year for American Tower by a significant margin. We also see a path to solid organic growth in our international segment, led by regions like Europe and Africa, where we're capturing activity from multiple network upgrade and densification cycles and are realizing the benefits of CPI-linked escalators on the vast majority of our leases. This will be complemented by what we expect to be yet another year of solid new build activity, primarily in international markets, where the current 4G and 5G network rollouts continue to drive strong demand for new infrastructure. And in our data centers business, where we're entering 2023 with record backlog, we'll continue to focus on driving increasing growth, both on an organic basis and through high-yield development opportunities that are ongoing today. Operationally, our teams are working to continue to build on the many efficiency and growth initiatives we've developed in recent years, which hits on another key objective within the organization: being the most trusted strategic partner for our customers. The most concrete example of our efforts on this front, probably the long-term multi-market agreement we recently announced with Airtel in Africa, which includes a meaningful new build pipeline, a joint commitment to build in accordance with new low-carbon emissions guidelines, which we're calling green sights and a partnership framework to enhance the impacts of both companies' digital communities and kiosks programs on the continent. This agreement exemplifies the benefits of our scale, best-in-class operations, and ability to deliver innovative solutions, while advancing both American Tower and our customers' long-term sustainability and fossil fuel consumption reduction targets. Going forward, we'll continue to work on building alignments with our global customers to leverage our scale to execute on opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder returns in a sustainable and responsible way. This includes an effort to accelerate our platform extensions. As I mentioned previously, demand trends in the data center space remain robust driven by digital platforms, leveraging distributed computing and by the early stages of a sustained enterprise migration from on-prem to hybrid IT and multi-cloud architectures. As a result, we see a long runway of opportunity to drive strong returns by investing in the expansion of our existing CoreSite campuses and leveraging the open cloud exchange to extend their interconnection-rich ecosystem. At the same time, we're working to position our combined platforms for outsized success as demand for the workloads and compute functions are drawn closer to the end users at the mobile edge. And as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth through platform extensions going forward, we'll continue to focus on how we can leverage our core competencies in real estate, power provision, and connectivity to drive incremental value to the ecosystem while delivering increasing shareholder returns. Meanwhile, as a management team, we're laser-focused on positioning our global teams for the future, while growing and maintaining a healthy cultural foundation. These together represent perhaps our most critical key objectives as our world-class team members are the most valuable asset in American Tower. As we position the company to be a market leader in an evolving landscape, we recognize that developing, empowering and retaining diverse and talented team members is fundamental to our success as a company. Through this lens, we've renewed our focus on management development and institute region-specific programs designed to support a balanced life for our teams amongst many other initiatives. We also appreciate that facilitating a culture that is inclusive and equitable is not only shown to drive better decision-making in business outcomes, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do for the people who dedicate so much of their time to growing this business and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. In summary, the long-term secular demand trends underpinning growth in our industry remain resilient. We believe we're optimally positioned to capitalize on the successes of our Stand and Deliver strategy to date. And we're more energized than ever as we look to execute on our initiatives in 2023 and deliver strong, sustainable returns for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to discuss our 2022 results and expectations for 2023. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2022 results and expectations for 2023, I would like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year and provide an update on several developments in India since our last earnings call. First, demand and operational performance across our global portfolio remain as solid as ever. We closed the year on a positive note with colocation and amendment tenant billings growth contributions of over 4% in Q4. In particular, our US and Canada property segment delivered its strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020, and we have a clear line of sight to continued acceleration into 2023, which I will discuss shortly. Organic growth was complemented by the construction of nearly 7,000 sites, an American Tower record, including over 2,300 sites built in Q4, our highest level over the past eight quarters with an average day one NOI yield of over 12%. Moreover, during its first full year of ownership by American Tower, CoreSite delivered record new business, selling nearly double the number of megawatts compared to the previous trailing two-year average, demonstrating the value of the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem. This robust growth was driven by increased demand from high quality new logos and expansions from existing customers, driven by secular tailwinds of digital transformation and the demand for hybrid IT solutions. Furthermore, since the announcement of CoreSite acquisition, we successfully executed on our permanent financing plan at attractive terms, including through the issuance of common equity and senior notes, as well as our strategic partnership with Stonepeak. These financing activities reduced our leverage from 6.8 times at the end of 2021 to 5.4 times at the end of 2022 and moved us closer to our target range of three times to five times. Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the latest developments in India. As anticipated, Vodafone Idea or VIL continued making partial payments in Q4 of 2022, consistent with our outlook, resulting in total revenue reserves of approximately $38 million for the quarter and around $87 million for the year. Recently, we were pleased to see the completion of the Indian government's conversion of the adjusted gross revenue interest balances to equity in VIL. We view this as a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to support a three-player private carrier telecommunications market and a critical first step towards the possibility of more stabilized collections from VIL. However, although VIL had committed to pay their billings in full in 2023 and make payments for outstanding balances from prior years in early 2023, they have communicated that they would continue to make partial payments. For that reason, we believe it is prudent to include revenue reserves against their annual billings and other contracted obligations in our 2023 outlook, which we've assumed at $75 million. We will, however, remain focused on collecting what we are contractually owed in full over the course of the year. In the meantime, we have worked to incrementally better position American Tower and our receivables balance, while also demonstrating a level of support for VIL and India's wireless market. This includes the expectation to convert approximately $200 million in existing VIL receivables into optionally convertible debentures pending Vodafone Idea shareholder approval. Upon closing this agreement, we would have elevated the seniority of our pre-existing receivables balance and established an additional level of liquid collateral at American Tower's option. And finally, as we remain focused on stabilizing our India business, collecting our outstanding and future receivables in full and assessing the positioning of our global portfolio, we are currently exploring various strategic options, including the potential sale of an equity stake in our India business. As always, any decision taken will include careful consideration of the growth opportunity and risk profile in the market going forward, valuation and the optimal portfolio and capital structure mix for American Tower and its stakeholders. We will certainly keep our investors informed of any developments as we move forward. With that, let's dive into the details of our full year 2022 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was nearly 15% and nearly 18% on an FX-neutral basis, which included a contribution of approximately 11% of growth from Telxius and CoreSite and negative impacts of approximately 2% and 1% from Sprint churn and revenue reserves taken associated with VIL in 2022, respectively. Organic tenant billings growth for the full year came in at 3.2%, in line with expectations, complemented by solid growth from new builds with actual volumes coming in at the upper end of our prior outlook range for the year. In the United States and Canada, property revenue growth was nearly 2% with organic tenant billings growth of just over 1%, in line with expectations, including approximately $150 million or 3.4% from colocations and amendments. Escalators added another 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was partially offset by churn of around 5%, which consisted of roughly 1% in normal course churn with the balance being driven by Sprint. Our international property revenue grew by nearly 13%. International organic tenant billings growth was 6.6%, led by Europe at 8.4% and followed by Latin America at 7.9%, Africa at 7.7% and APAC at 2.6%. Overall, colocation and amendment growth for the full year was around 5%, while 6% came from escalators, partially offset by just over 4.5% of churn, the result of decommissioning agreements in Latin America, carrier consolidation in Africa and customer-specific churn in APAC. Finally, our data center segment contributed over $765 million to our total property revenue in 2022, including a record year of new business from CoreSite as I previously mentioned. Moving on, adjusted EBITDA grew around 11% to over $6.6 billion or around 13% on an FX-neutral basis for the year. Growth was supported by solid contributions from Telxius and CoreSite and strong flow-through of top line growth achieved through effective cost management. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 190 basis points as compared to 2021, primarily due to the impacts of the VIL reserves and Sprint churn in the US, higher pass-through revenue due to rising fuel costs and the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by approximately 5.6% and 3.5%, respectively, including over 11% growth on a per share basis in Q4. For the year, both metrics included over 2% in headwinds associated with FX. Attributable AFFO per share of $9.76 exceeded the original 2022 outlook midpoint laid out a year ago by $0.06, despite absorbing the negative impacts of incremental VIL reserves, rate-driven interest costs and FX relative to our initial assumptions. Now before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2023, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, as we've previously communicated, we expect a meaningful step-up in US and Canada organic tenant billings growth, driven by an acceleration in new business backstopped by the comprehensive MLAs we have signed over the last few years together with the sequential improvement in contracted Sprint churn. Internationally, we expect a strong year of organic tenant billings growth across most of our regions driven by continued strength in organic leasing trends, along with contributions from CPI-based escalators, particularly in Europe and Africa. As we've communicated over the past couple of quarters, growth in Latin America will be moderated by churn headwinds associated with a continuation of Telefonica churn in Mexico and Oi churn in Brazil, where we'll see some staggered impacts over the next several years. Second, and as I mentioned earlier, we have factored into our guide an expectation for a continuation in VIL collections volatility, resulting in an assumption of $75 million in revenue reserves for the year. Third, given the unprecedented rise in interest rates over the course of 2022, which saw the one-month LIBOR increased by more than 400 basis points and 10-year treasuries increased by around 250 basis points from the beginning to the end of the year, we expect 2023 to have one-time outsized negative growth headwinds associated with financing costs. Key components driving this assumption include elevated costs on our floating rate debt and to a lesser extent, the refinancing of our 2023 senior note maturities as well as the full year impacts of our 2022 equity-related initiatives, including our common equity issuance and the incremental minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our partnership with Stonepeak. Taken together, we have assumed a roughly 8% headwind to attributable AFFO per share growth associated with financing costs in 2023. Next, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $150 million for property revenue, $64 million for adjusted EBITDA and $47 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2022. And finally, looking beyond the challenges I mentioned associated with interest rates, VIL reserves and FX, our core business continues to demonstrate strong performance and resiliency, representing nearly double-digit year-over-year growth at the attributable AFFO level. While this performance is fueled by the solid organic leasing trends we're seeing across our global portfolio, it's further amplified by exceptional conversion rates through AFFO, achieved through a keen focus on cost management across our business. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving on to the details of slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenues of nearly $10.8 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% or approximately 4% absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023. Our guide includes expected cash revenue growth of around $230 million in the US and Canada, and $245 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions, excluding the 2023 VIL reserves of $75 million. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $55 million of growth in cash revenue to the property segment in 2023. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate a modest FX headwind of just under 1.5% to consolidated growth. Turning to slide 8. We expect organic growth to contribute meaningfully to our property revenue growth assumptions. Starting with the US and Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% or greater than 6% excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes record levels of year-over-year co-location and amendment growth of around $220 million, a nearly 50% increase over the levels achieved in 2022 and a 60% increase as compared to the trailing three-year average. Of the $220 million, over 90% is locked in through MLA-driven use right fee commencements and carryover growth. On the churn side of the equation, after incurring the largest impact of Sprint churn last year, we expect churn of around 3% in 2023, including an approximate 1% impact associated with Sprint, which would represent a year-over-year improvement of over 200 basis points in the segment. Moving to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 2% for the year driven by relatively consistent co-location and amendment activity and continued solid contributions from CPI-based escalators of approximately 8%. This escalator rate does represent a step down from 2022 levels, as we saw inflation in markets like Brazil moderate in 2022 as compared to 2021. As we've previously highlighted, higher churn of around 8% is partially offsetting gross growth due to the expected continuation of Telefonica churn in Mexico and the early part of what we expect to be staggered Oi churn in Brazil. Similar to last year, we do expect to receive some settlement payments from Telefonica over the course of the year, which will be captured outside of the organic tenant billings growth metric. We've assumed approximately $50 million in 2023 payments as compared to the over $80 million we received from Telefonica Mexico and Nextel Brazil in 2022. Turning to Asia Pacific. We are guiding to approximately 4% organic tenant billings growth in 2023, including churn of around 4%, which is around 70 basis points lower than the 2022 churn rate. We expect co-location and amendment growth contributions to ramp up compared to 2022, coming in around 6%, fueled by the rollout of 5G networks. However, it is important to note that the reserves we've assumed for VIL in our guide reside outside of this metric, consistent with past practices. Turning to Europe. 2023 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 7% to 8%, which is slightly lower than 2022 due to the mathematical benefits realized last year, given Telxius was only in the prior year base for a partial year. However, this does suggest a solid acceleration off our Q4 2022 organic growth rate of around 6%, which represents a more normalized comparison. On the co-location and amendment front, we anticipate 2% to 3% growth, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 6%, reflecting the benefits of CPI-linked escalators across the majority of our European footprint. Churn is expected to decline to around 1%, reaping the benefits of the lower churn profile of our recently acquired Telxius portfolio. Finally, in Africa, we expect a solid acceleration off of 2022, with expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9%. This includes co-location and amendment contributions of around 6%, along with escalators of around 10% and expected 450 basis point increase from 2022 levels. This will be partially offset by an expectation of elevated churn of greater than 6%, as carrier consolidation continues to work its way through the financial metrics. Moving on to slide nine. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 4% and around 5%, absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023, while absorbing approximately 1% in FX headwinds. We expect this growth to be achieved through solid cash conversion rates of 85% to 90%, the result of prudent cost controls across the business and the expectations for another strong year from our US services business. Turning to slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to decrease by $0.16 on a reported basis, while remaining flat year-over-year absent the impacts of the 2023 VIL revenue reserves. As mentioned, we expect growth to be meaningfully impacted by financing costs, which include a rate-driven increase to cash interest expense along with the incremental full year impact of minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our US data center business. Together with the common equity share issuance in 2022, financing costs are expected to provide a significant one-time growth headwinds of approximately 8% in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, absent the impact of financing costs, FX and the 2023 VIL reserves, our business is demonstrating solid growth contributions of around 9%. Moving on to slide 11, I'll review our capital plans for 2023 and our balance sheet progress and priorities for the upcoming year. In 2023, we will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders through the growth of our dividend. And subject to Board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $3 billion, representing an approximately 10% year-on-year growth rate on a per share basis. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.7 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. This will largely be spent continuing the success of our new build program internationally, which assumes the construction of around 4,000 sites at the midpoint. We also expect data center capital to increase modestly as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity. Moving to the right side of the slide. As you can see, we made tremendous progress towards strengthening our balance sheet over the course of 2022, putting us ahead of the deleveraging path we committed to with the rating agencies, which actually afforded us the flexibility to repurchase a modest number of our shares in Q4. Throughout 2023, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing financial policies as we execute on our financing plans. This includes the refinancing of maturing debt, while leveraging our strong liquidity position as needed to remain opportunistic as we access the capital markets. Finally, we remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. And our priorities over the course of 2023 and into 2024 remain on deleveraging our balance sheet back down to the three to five times range. Consistent with our recent comments, at this time, we do not see any material M&A in our pipeline that would alter these areas of focus. Turning to slide 12. And in summary, we delivered strong results in 2022, demonstrating the resiliency of our business model in the face of various macro-related and customer-specific challenges. Our global portfolio of assets and operational capabilities continue to prove critical in meeting the growing demands of our customers and the customers they serve. We saw record new build volumes internationally and record leasing within our CoreSite business and experienced a steady acceleration in colocation and amendment growth as we exited 2022, which we expect to continue into 2023. As we look ahead, we expect to further build on the successes of the recent years and leverage our portfolio to drive strong recurring growth on the back of consistent secular technology trends for many years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Tom, you talked about scaling the core, and Rod just talked about no material M&A in the pipeline, thanks for that. Just give us a little bit more color, if you could, on how you see the portfolio today. And is this the mix of assets that you want? You've obviously talked about potentially monetizing some of India. But any kind of areas where you feel like you're overexposed or underexposed? And how long is this sort of approach of not doing large deals likely to last? And then you talked about the strong results in CoreSite. You did buy some land there. I've noticed your future development pipeline potential goes up quite significantly, probably as a result of that. Just give us some color as how you think about beyond just incremental capacity, something larger, given the opportunities you see there? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett : Yes. Sure, Simon. You got a lot going on in that question. But let me try to peel it back and then remind me if I left anything out. With regards to scale of the core, it really comes down to really three pieces. One is to just do what we do every day, that's servicing our customers and driving that organic growth. And we've really been very focused on that in the US as you saw our expectations for 2023 and beyond, because those large-scale relationships that we put in place with our -- the critical carriers in the United States are long-term in nature. And so we now have a very predictable growth path in the US. And the US is the foundation really of our entire business. And what I've always said is that we enjoy the benefits of diversification, because there are going to be some markets that are going to grow significantly, others that are going to grow less so simply because the methodology that all of our customers use for build are different. And they all form those different sign waves as we've talked about in the past. And we can -- if you can layer on all those sign paths, you're able to get some predictable rates of growth. And so we're excited about coming out of 2022 strongly. We expect higher rates of growth in 2023 and in particular, within the United States. From a total portfolio perspective, we're constantly looking at where we can maximize value. And we are in 26 countries today, and there could be certain markets there where it may just make sense for us from a number of different perspectives for us to peel back some of those assets. Don't have anything in mind as we speak. We're constantly evaluating it. That's kind of what we do. And with regards to India, India is a market where they're going to have a higher population than China, if not now, very soon. They have huge penetration, huge data usage. And it's a market that we would like to be able to continue to keep our toe in because we continue to believe that there is significant growth there. To the extent that we can bring in a third-party player to monetize the particular part of the asset and reallocate some of that capital in some other parts of the market, we'll look at that. It's purely opportunistic, and we look at every kind of available opportunity as we speak. With regards to our data center business, of course, I had a terrific 2022 record sales in 2022. And they're replenishing capacity where they needed. We've added land in Denver and New Jersey, where we needed some additional runway. But we've got a good amount of capacity in the hopper. We're building out another 30 megawatts of capacity under construction. We actually got one-third of that already pre-leased, and we have 224 megawatts for future development. So there's an incredible demand, as you well know, as we've heard from other competitors in the market for interconnection hubs. And that's what I really refer to as core side. It's not a co-location facility. It's an interconnection hub creating opportunities for new logos. We added over hundred logos last year. And we're really excited about the opportunity and the demand that we see in the market for activity relative to our data center business in the United States. Did I miss anything, Simon?\nSimon Flannery: Well, I guess, just in terms of the scale M&A, you've obviously done a lot of deals over the years. If you get back down into that three times to five times leverage, is that when we think about you're potentially looking at larger deals again?\nTom Bartlett: Interesting, Simon. We have a lot of different ways of being able to secure M&A. We demonstrated that really with what we've done in Europe, with our capital, even in the United States with Stonepeak in terms of private capital. So I think the capital is there. For us, yeah, it is a function that our objective is to delever. I really do want to get down to that five times kind of leverage. And so that remains a top priority for the business. But on top of that, we want to continue to feed our build program. We had record build last year. We have a strong build program this year. With regards to the M&A, there's just still a significant difference between the valuations, the bid and the ask. And there's nothing out there that's compelling as we see it today. And so our focus continues to be on, as I said, what we do every day, driving organic growth, driving efficiency. You see we expect margin improvement in 2023 versus 2022 and supporting our build program. Our customers are very active around the world from a build perspective. And I think in the last several years, we brought in like \u2013 we built like 25,000 sites. And so there's a significant opportunity there, and the returns are incredibly compelling on that new build program. So as I said, there's just nothing at this point in time that we see out there that's interesting really from an M&A perspective. And we continue to just keep our head down in terms of funding our build program and delevering our business.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTom Bartlett: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRick Prentiss: Thanks, Good morning, everyone.\nTom Bartlett: Hey Rick.\nRick Prentiss: A couple of questions. I'll give it to you part-by-part. First, as we think about the guidance, and thanks for all the color there, how should we think about in US, Canada the pacing throughout the year? Is it going to ramp through the year? Does it start high and come down? Is it balanced? But opening question everybody is trying to figure out what is happening with the pacing in 2023 in US, Canada?\nTom Bartlett: Actually, Rick, it's going to be very consistent, very linear throughout the year. And so largely, it's a function of the relationships and the agreements that we have in place. But we would expect it to be very consistent in the US throughout the year.\nRick Prentiss: Okay. And the related question to extrapolate from that is last year at this time, you laid out some thoughts on longer-term leasing activity in the US, Canada 2023 through 2027 being above 5% and then extraordinarily above -- equal or above 6%. How are you feeling about that exiting 2023, looking at 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 as you gave us a year ago?\nTom Bartlett: Yeah, exactly the same. I mean, it's \u2013 as we have said, as we have predicted, as we have thought, and again, it comes down to largely the relationships that we have with our customers. We see strong demand coming out. I still think we're in the early innings really with 5G. Our customers on average are probably on about half of our sites. So there is a significant amount of opportunity there. But it also comes down to the types of relationships and the arrangements that we have with regards to our MLAs. So we are underscoring really what we had said a year ago relative to growth coming out of 2023 through 2027.\nRick Prentiss: Okay. And the last one for me, taking that to the bottom line, attributable AFFO per share last year at this time mentioned that 21 to 27 maybe above \u2013 at or above 10%. We've had a couple of tough years here with Sprint churn. 2023, we've got financing costs, still some Indian reserves. How do we think throw away 2021 to 2027 and just say, hey, as we look at 2023 as a new base point, how are you feeling about that ability to grow attributable FFO per share, dividend per share from this point onwards?\nTom Bartlett: Well, I mean, you've got a couple of questions in there. We're not going to \u2013 we're not focused on rolling out a long-term guide at this point, as you would expect. But there have been some significant macro environment changes that happened around the world that we use to underwrite kind of that double-digit expectation, which I think is what you're referring to. But I'm not letting the foot off the gas in the business, okay? We're not changing anything at this point in time. Our core growth, as Rod just walked through, really remains really, really strong. And we don't have any expectations for that kind of growth diminishing. We see kind of 4G, 5G being rolled out across all of our footprints, which really gives us a lot of comfort in terms of being able to suggest that, that growth is going to continue. Now, also having the types of relationships that we do with our customers in the United States helps underpin a lot of that growth. The interest rates, Rod walked through the impact of rates. It's kind of a reset in 2023. I believe it to be kind of more of a one-off, if you will, in 2023. So we remain really bullish on going forward. As I said, I'm not going to talk about long-term guide, but I'm not letting the gas \u2013 letting the foot off the gas at all within the business. With regards to \u2013 of our dividend program, as you all know, you're a REIT expert. Our policy is just followed our REIT TI. And it's been very consistent. We've been able to enjoy double-digit rates of growth on our dividend for the better part of the last 10 years actually, which has been very supportive. And we continue to be \u2013 we continue to feel that our dividend is an important part of our total shareholder return. So we're looking at 10% dividend, as Rod talked about this year. It's difficult really to predict what that might be. It depends upon what we bring into the REIT, what's not in the REIT, obviously, what kind of M&A exists out there. It could drop a little bit to high single digits. But again, we continue to expect it to grow significantly. And as I said, it's an important piece of our overall total shareholder return.\nRick Prentiss: Great. Thank so much. Everybody stay well.\nTom Bartlett: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. So first, and maybe this is a slightly different question on the US leasing environment. But you outlined the percentage of revenue tied to comprehensive deals. I'm just curious if you can unpack where the flex could be in US performance, both in 2023 and maybe going forward as you think about the organic leasing growth potential of the US business. And then thinking a little bit more about the percent of revenue that you have tied to comprehensive deals. You shared a lot over the last couple of years on how the US has been shaping up on that front. Can you share with us how other regions fit in terms of the percent of revenue tied to comprehensive deals? And as you work with your customers, are there aspirations that you have in different markets to get that to certain levels over time? Thanks.\nRod Smith: Hey, Michael. Good morning. This is Rod. I'll start here, and Tom can certainly join in. So -- but in the US, the leasing activity is really strong. And our revenue in the US is underpinned through what we refer to as the holistic agreements, which I think everyone is very familiar with. But we've seen contributions from colocations and amendments rise from about $150 million in 2022, up to $220 million in 2023. That drives about a 5% contribution to our organic tenant billings growth. And as Tom mentioned in his previous answer, we see about 90% of that locked in for 2023. And the long-term guidance that Rick asked about, we are continuing to target equal to or greater than 5% between 2023 out to 2027. And a fair amount of that activity, both the underlying revenue and the revenue growth, is locked in as part of the holistic deals. Now of course, as we move beyond 2023, that 90% will come down maybe to about two-thirds or so by the time you get in the outer years. And that's just a function of getting closer to the end of some of the agreements, and chances are some agreements will be rewritten sort of along the way. So we feel really good about the visibility we have into the US leasing market and the strength that we're seeing in the US market, particularly because of our assets and the way that we drive these agreements. Now your question kind of refers to flex. And I think what you mean there is where is the potential upside? And of course, there is a potential upside to the extent that there's faster uptake on 5G utilization in the US. And if that requires carriers to densify the networks a little bit quicker, and we see a faster conversion for colocations and fewer amendments going forward, that could certainly provide some upside. And then depending on just the build of some of the carriers. And certainly, DISH comes to mind as they build a greenfield network to the extent that they go beyond their minimum commitments with us, that could certainly be some upside as well. So I would really kind of watch -- certainly watch DISH. I would watch the other carriers and see the 5G utilization. And some of these new applications come out for 5G, we'll see what kind of bandwidth constraints that puts on networks and when network densification may end up happening. But it's a pretty exciting time in the US market, particularly when you look at the 5G networks and potential applications coming down the pike. So I think that kind of covers off the points around the US leasing. When you think about our international business, we don't have holistic deals in the same way in a material fashion outside the US. They are much more traditional green, more of an a la carte, kind of pay as you go around the globe. So, that's what I would say about that point, Michael.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So, I guess the first one would be, Tom, thank you for your commentary around kind of the commitment to deleveraging. And I think you said 'there's nothing compelling out there,' significant differences between bid and ask on the buy side of that equation. So, to the extent that, that is true, is that what's informing your openness now to looking at an equity sale of the India market? Meaning that if things are too expensive to buy, maybe now is the right time to sell. And is that exclusive to the India market, or as you look across the portfolio, could you make the same argument that maybe it's an interesting time to monetize Latin America or other pieces of that? Part two of that would be is now the right time to think about this given the situation with VIL, or should we wait until that situation maybe resolve itself and then we think about an equity sale? And then, Rod, if I could -- so you went out of your way to mention that the financing impact on the AFFO -- attributable AFFO per your calculation is going to be about 8% for the year. Absent that and absent the provisions for VIL, we might be seeing an underlying 8% to 9% AFFO growth per share. Is that our takeaway for how we think about 2024, that obviously, other things aside and the fundamentals across the world that our starting point for thinking about 2024 is an 8% to 9% FFO growth business. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Okay. Dave, you got a bunch of stuff packed in there. Let me start to -- no. Relative to the M&A in India, there's not a direct connect between the two. They are somewhat mutually exclusive types of decisions. And it really becomes, again, part of a broader portfolio kind of conversation relative to what we think may make sense for the portfolio in terms of driving further value over time. India is really just kind of an opportunistic at this point in time. And really, it's -- we're in kind of the exploration mode at this point. A number of things going on there. And to the extent that there is, again, a value creation opportunity for us, we can continue to enjoy the growth of the market and utilize that capital in other parts of the world, including using it to further de-lever, perhaps more -- even more quickly than we would have otherwise thought is not a bad thing. So, there -- I understand the kind of the connection that you're drawing there, but I'm not really looking them in that way. And I really do believe the paths are separate.\nRod Smith: Good morning David I'll take the next one here on the AFFO per share growth. So, you can see in the chart that we laid out, we have FFO per share going from $9.76 to really down to $9.60 on an attributable basis. As we mentioned, the financing costs, you can see on the chart there, the $315 million represents about $0.68 of that or about an 8% headwind. The 405 is what's coming from our regional businesses, including our corporate cost centers. And that 405 represents about a 9% growth. So that's kind of a core growth rate that we're generating from our operating. The FX headwind is about 1%. And then VIL represents about 2% headwind. And when you put it all together, you get to a negative 2% growth. But to the extent that the financing impacts here really are one-time, which we expect, we expect interest to kind of peak this year and then -- in the middle of this year and maybe trend down towards next year, assuming they stay flat or even decline and become a tailwind next year. That certainly would be a good fact. But that could remove that 8% headwind on us. FX and the VIL situation in India, both are somewhat unpredictable. But if you put those aside, we feel really good about our global operating business in that upper single-digit growth rate in this environment. And of course, with these uncertainties around FX and maybe recessions in the US and other places, we'll watch and see how that unfolds. But absent the volatility in India, absent the FX and the financing headwinds, we feel very good about an upper single-digit sort of a growth rate from our operating units. And that's all driven and underpinned by growth in mobile data consumption around the globe and the need for tower space. And our portfolio is just really well positioned to benefit from that.\nDavid Barden: Okay. Great. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nRod Smith: Yes. Thanks. David.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi. This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up on the builds. So what do you see as the most attractive markets right now internationally?\nRod Smith : When it comes to our build program, Richard, I mean, we're going to build about 4,000 sites this year. That's the expectation. The biggest chunks here really come from Africa and India in the range of 1,600, 1,700 sites each in those areas. In Europe, we're going to drive just over 400. In Latin America, maybe just under 300 sites. So there's an opportunity to build in all of these markets. And we get really good NOI yields in these markets kind of across the board. So it's not just about the volume of sites. Certainly, we like the idea of increasing our footprint Europe, in particular, driving more builds there with very highly credit quality customers in really attractive economies. So the 400 plus, 400 to 500 sites we'll build there are very attractive to us. But as Tom talked about with scaling the core, anywhere where we have management teams and assets and customers, to the extent we can add assets through an internal CapEx program with high NOI yields, it creates a lot of value for our shareholders long-term. It's good for our customers as well. So we think all of these markets are attractive in terms of our ability to build new assets.\nTom Bartlett: Just adding on to that, one of the really interesting, I think, parts of the build is what we're doing in Africa, because we're really focused on building green sites in Africa with Airtel and really leveraging a lot of the power and fuel competencies that we've created in that market. We brought in solar to over 15,000 sites. We brought over lithium-ion in over 19,000 sites. We've reduced 5 million liters of diesel over the last several years. And so there is an incredible competency that we're building with regards to Power as a Service in that marketplace. And we're able to bring that then on to those green sites that we're building in conjunction with our -- with the agreement with Airtel. So that's a particular interest that we're really excited about over the next couple of years.\nRichard Choe: And coming back to the US, you said about the carriers are about 50% of your sites are 5G. When can we see, I guess, more densification activity? Do you think that's coming at the end of this year or into next year?\nTom Bartlett: I'm certain that there are certain pockets of the United States where we're already seeing some densification going on in the marketplace. And so I would expect that to continue as penetration continues with 5G sets. Keep in mind, it's in the carrier's best interest to deploy out 5G, because it's going to lower their overall cost of providing service. And so as activity continues to drive and as applications continue to develop and get deployed, you'll start to see that densification. But -- so I think it is already going on. And I would expect that over the next two to three years, we'll see an increase even in the densification within the market. Also keep in mind that carriers are using slightly higher spectrum bands. And so given the propagation characteristics, they're going to be requiring higher levels of densification as a result of that as well.\nRichard Choe: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just wanted to check in on the LATAM business. Obviously, as you mentioned, some churn impacts this year. Maybe you could break out the impact from Telefonica and Oi in your guide? And what type of visibility you have on churn beyond 2023 when some of these events may resolve and we could see organic growth go back to historical upper single-digit ranges? And then secondly, just a balance sheet question for Rod, obviously, a big increase in interest expense. Maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about managing the balance sheet this year in terms of fixed floating mix, whether there's the possibility of terming out some additional floating rate debt given the inverted yield curve or accessing the secured market or anything else you're looking at to help drive that down? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. Sounds good, Eric. So when it comes to Latin America, I guess what I would point to is our guide on organic tenant billings growth is a little bit higher than 2%. That comes in a few pieces. The gross new business is going to be in the mid-single digits, let's call it, around 3% or so. We're also seeing higher escalators at around 8%. And we do have a headwind of churn of about 8% as well. That's the bits and pieces in terms of getting into that growth rate. So you can see the churn number is fairly high. We do think it's temporary, and we do think it will work through it over the next couple of years and get back to a more compelling overall growth in the market. And when it comes to the churn pieces in our guide specifically, when you look out here in 2023, Telefonica is really the biggest piece. And I don't want to get too detailed in terms of customers. But I think everyone knows what's happening in Mexico with Telefonica and then joining AT&T as an MVNO there. So that's driving a fair amount of the churn. We're also seeing some churn remaining from American Movil really through the Nextel assets that were purchased down in Brazil. Those are the two things other than smaller churn, smaller customers throughout the region. But it's really the Nextel and the Telefonica in the bigger piece. And then the Oi piece really is going to be out over time. So there's a couple of things that I would say about Oi. Oi in total is about $100 million of revenue for us. It represents about 1% of our overall business. About one-third of that is tied in with their landline business, which we fully expect that the landline business of Oi will keep those sites over time. The other two-thirds, we have, on average, five to six years remaining on the length there. So that will be -- kind of over time, we'll see Oi is not a significant impact today that we're seeing, but that may start unfolding this year and into next as we negotiate with the three players who kind of carved up the Oi. It will probably extend into a multiyear period in terms of getting through Oi. So that's kind of what's happening in Latin America relative to the churn issues. Yes. On the balance sheet, a couple of things that I would say. I mean, we have longstanding percentage policies when it comes to fixed and floating. We run 80-20. We're pretty much there at the end of 2022. We expect to stay in and around that range. I mean, we can be opportunistic. I think you saw it at the very end of 2021 just before interest rates began to rise. We were fairly aggressive in terms of terming out floating rate balances. We got our floating rate percentage down to closer to 10%. With about 90% or just over 90% on fixed, we did that very purposefully to take advantage of the low rates, both in the US bond market and the euro market. And that was just ahead of purchasing the data center business on December 28, 2021. So we can be flexible there. In terms of managing the balance sheet going forward, we have about $3 billion in bonds that we'll refinance this year. We'll look at a variety of opportunities to do that. That could come in the form of getting into the US capital markets that we can do that or parts of that in the European markets. And of course, we'll be balancing short-term and long-term rates. We could stay on the shorter end of the curve and with the expectation that rates may come down in the next couple of years, and then we go out longer when the rates are more attractive. We can also secure some of the debt that's on the balance sheet to the extent we refinance it and maybe carve off some savings from that perspective as well. So there are a lot of opportunities in terms of looking at the market. There's a lot to consider in terms of where we expect rates to head. But as I said earlier in one of my last comments, we do expect that rates will probably peak here in the US this year, maybe even drift down later in the year. And we'll continue to watch the markets and interest rates and economy to see what we expect to be happening next year. But we'll be looking at the full curve and all the different capital opportunities that we have in front of us to make the very best decisions going forward.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks, Rod.\nRod Smith: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Just following up on India and specifically for Vodafone. Can you size the partial payments that they're making right now, if there's been a change in the pacing? And if there are any adjustments to the pricing of their contract with you? And just going back to evaluating strategic options for India. It's been a challenging market, but potentially there is some improvement. How do you sort of underwrite what valuation you would take versus the -- your long-term growth assumptions in that region? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Hey, Batya, I'll take the India reserve question. So you can see in our outlook for 2023, we are calling out a specific reserve for VIL of about $75 million. That's up against on a revenue reserve basis from 2022, we reserved close to $100 million for really the last two quarters in 2022. What I can tell you is, the percentage -- I don't want to get into percentages of revenue that they're paying and those sorts of things. But I will highlight that in January, they're paying us a little bit more than they were paying us in the end of 2022. So we are seeing some improvement in terms of the collections through VIL. And we do expect that, that improvement will kind of continue, and we'll collect even a little bit more from a variety of their commitments to us as we look out over the balance of 2023. We do expect them to be getting back closer to and increasing their payments to us towards the end of the year. So we do expect to see some improvements going in that direction. That's kind of what I would say. In terms of the contracts, we haven't really written any MLAs or leasing contracts with them. We have entered into the $200 million convertible debenture, which also have some terms and conditions embedded in it that call out specific time periods in terms of when payments are due. It also has some additional terms and conditions around staying current with leasing fees within the MLAs and those sorts of things. So there's that additional agreement, which gives us a few additional kind of safety nets or safety belts here. But the situation there is volatile. We're focused on trying to support VIL through this period. We were very encouraged by the government conversion. We think that could be the beginning of better things for VIL in terms of raising additional capital going forward. And we're focused on long-term value creation and having VIL as a partner in India over the long term. And maybe on your second question, can you remind me what it was?\nBatya Levi: Yes. With improvement in India, why is this the right time to look for strategic options in the region?\nRod Smith: Yes, I would say, it's really just being opportunistic, kind of, looking at the market. Certainly, India has been volatile over the last few years and maybe even a little bit longer than that. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we look at all of our portfolio assets around the globe kind of on a constant basis and evaluate growth opportunities, valuations and other things. So we are in the process of looking at strategic options in India. We haven't made any decisions at this point, but we are kind of going through a process in evaluating things. And it's really around being opportunistic. We do believe that the Indian market is an interesting market and does hold some upside, but there's also a fair amount of volatility that we have experienced. So we'll be looking at a number of things. And when and if we conclude and make any decisions, we'll certainly let everybody know.\nBatya Levi: Okay. Thank you.\nRod Smith: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from SVB MoffettNathanson. Please, go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just a follow-up on the India question. Tom, you've emphasized how important new site builds are to your growth outlook and the returns you get with them. Obviously, there's a step down in your build plan in 2023 versus 2022, and it looks like the driver is primarily India. So, I guess, does that explicitly tie into your view that India is more volatile, potentially less appealing market than you once believed, or is something else driving that downshift?\nTom Bartlett: No, it's really not. As a matter of fact, if you saw the numbers coming in from the field in terms of what they expected to build, it's significantly higher, candidly. And what I -- what we do is, we ratchet that back and look at the opportunity and look at where we can drive the most value there. So there's nothing going on there with regards to the pullback on sites. By the way, we will see different levels of site build in each one of the countries, just like we see different levels of colos, amendments depending upon what densification looks like and what the carriers are looking like. But now I wouldn't read in anything in terms of the pullback on India new builds for 2023.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe turning to CoreSite, since you've had it for a little more than a year. It seems like things are going consistent with your underwriting, maybe even a bit better. I guess bigger picture, any key learnings you'd highlight now that you've had a chance to have deep discussions with CoreSite's customers and your tower customers about the vision for how you could integrate those assets or have them work together? And I guess, more generally, any adaptations or refinements of your plan versus a year ago that you'd want to highlight?\nTom Bartlett : Yes. No, nothing specific. I mean, I -- we have a fair amount of history in the kind of in that particular part of the infrastructure business. We knew what the model was that CoreSite was delivering on with their customers and how significant interconnection was in terms of driving value for their customers as well as for the cloud and service operators, and that demand continues. And it's a significant barrier to entry for others to be able to compete against them. I'm continually incredibly impressed with the team and how they think about returns and how they think about the relationships with the customers. So -- but that wasn't surprise, because I thought that candidly through the entire due diligence process. So I knew the quality of the group. We did enjoy significant growth in 2022, which I think just goes to the strength of the team and strength of the value proposition that they're offering their customers. And we believe that 2023 is going to be another strong year. We still have, as you would expect, a significant amount of energy around what the edge will ultimately look like. We have created an advisory board. We have a lab set up. We have plans to start to look at building out some of that capacity. We've identified about 1,000 sites within the United States that can handle up to over a meg of capacity. And through the relationships that we've been able to develop really through CoreSite with the cloud, we remain really optimistic about what that opportunity is going to look like and how we're going to be able to drive incremental business to our tower site, which is in and of itself has a strong competitive barrier given the ownership that we have of the land and of the site. And so we're very excited about it. There's nothing in our guide relative to performance coming from that activity. And as we've said, it's going to be a multi-year rollout. But we think that as a result of the CoreSite assets as well as our tower assets, we're really uniquely positioned to be a meaningful part of the puzzle as the edge continues to develop. So as I said, I think we would just continue to underscore what we originally had thought, and we're continually working very methodically in terms of trying to become that linchpin for rolling out that kind of capability.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Thank you, Tom.\nRod Smith : And Nick, maybe I'll just add -- complement on to what Tom said here. As we wait for the edge or work for the edge to develop, the CoreSite business is performing exceptionally well and right in line with our expectations. You heard us talk earlier about the record new business that we achieved in 2022. We see strong demand from enterprise customers on those core data center assets that we have around the country. A few of the key metrics here. We are seeing escalations right around 3% on our rental space, which is right in our target range. We see cash mark-to-market adjustments for 2023 go up beyond where they were in 2022. So, they've gone from about 2% up to maybe 3% to 3.5%. So, that's certainly a good factor. Churn continues to be in and around 6.5%, which is on the low end of our range. Interconnection growth we expect in 2023 to be in the 6% to 8% range, kind of right in line with where we would expect it to be. And our development CapEx is coming in at around $360 million for 2023. And much of that is to replace capacity that we sold in 2022 through those record new business numbers that we will be deploying in 2023 and 2024. Replacing that capacity is really where the CapEx is being deployed. So, we're seeing very good results and really demand from that CoreSite business, again, as we look to work to develop the edge.\nNick Del Deo: That\u2019s great color. thank you both.\nOperator: And that's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the conference back to your speakers for any closing remarks.\nAdam Smith: I appreciate everybody joining the call.

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2022 results and expectations for 2023, I would like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year and provide an update on several developments in India since our last earnings call. First, demand and operational performance across our global portfolio remain as solid as ever. We closed the year on a positive note with colocation and amendment tenant billings growth contributions of over 4% in Q4. In particular, our US and Canada property segment delivered its strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020, and we have a clear line of sight to continued acceleration into 2023, which I will discuss shortly. Organic growth was complemented by the construction of nearly 7,000 sites, an American Tower record, including over 2,300 sites built in Q4, our highest level over the past eight quarters with an average day one NOI yield of over 12%. Moreover, during its first full year of ownership by American Tower, CoreSite delivered record new business, selling nearly double the number of megawatts compared to the previous trailing two-year average, demonstrating the value of the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem. This robust growth was driven by increased demand from high quality new logos and expansions from existing customers, driven by secular tailwinds of digital transformation and the demand for hybrid IT solutions. Furthermore, since the announcement of CoreSite acquisition, we successfully executed on our permanent financing plan at attractive terms, including through the issuance of common equity and senior notes, as well as our strategic partnership with Stonepeak. These financing activities reduced our leverage from 6.8 times at the end of 2021 to 5.4 times at the end of 2022 and moved us closer to our target range of three times to five times. Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the latest developments in India. As anticipated, Vodafone Idea or VIL continued making partial payments in Q4 of 2022, consistent with our outlook, resulting in total revenue reserves of approximately $38 million for the quarter and around $87 million for the year. Recently, we were pleased to see the completion of the Indian government's conversion of the adjusted gross revenue interest balances to equity in VIL. We view this as a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to support a three-player private carrier telecommunications market and a critical first step towards the possibility of more stabilized collections from VIL. However, although VIL had committed to pay their billings in full in 2023 and make payments for outstanding balances from prior years in early 2023, they have communicated that they would continue to make partial payments. For that reason, we believe it is prudent to include revenue reserves against their annual billings and other contracted obligations in our 2023 outlook, which we've assumed at $75 million. We will, however, remain focused on collecting what we are contractually owed in full over the course of the year. In the meantime, we have worked to incrementally better position American Tower and our receivables balance, while also demonstrating a level of support for VIL and India's wireless market. This includes the expectation to convert approximately $200 million in existing VIL receivables into optionally convertible debentures pending Vodafone Idea shareholder approval. Upon closing this agreement, we would have elevated the seniority of our pre-existing receivables balance and established an additional level of liquid collateral at American Tower's option. And finally, as we remain focused on stabilizing our India business, collecting our outstanding and future receivables in full and assessing the positioning of our global portfolio, we are currently exploring various strategic options, including the potential sale of an equity stake in our India business. As always, any decision taken will include careful consideration of the growth opportunity and risk profile in the market going forward, valuation and the optimal portfolio and capital structure mix for American Tower and its stakeholders. We will certainly keep our investors informed of any developments as we move forward. With that, let's dive into the details of our full year 2022 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was nearly 15% and nearly 18% on an FX-neutral basis, which included a contribution of approximately 11% of growth from Telxius and CoreSite and negative impacts of approximately 2% and 1% from Sprint churn and revenue reserves taken associated with VIL in 2022, respectively. Organic tenant billings growth for the full year came in at 3.2%, in line with expectations, complemented by solid growth from new builds with actual volumes coming in at the upper end of our prior outlook range for the year. In the United States and Canada, property revenue growth was nearly 2% with organic tenant billings growth of just over 1%, in line with expectations, including approximately $150 million or 3.4% from colocations and amendments. Escalators added another 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was partially offset by churn of around 5%, which consisted of roughly 1% in normal course churn with the balance being driven by Sprint. Our international property revenue grew by nearly 13%. International organic tenant billings growth was 6.6%, led by Europe at 8.4% and followed by Latin America at 7.9%, Africa at 7.7% and APAC at 2.6%. Overall, colocation and amendment growth for the full year was around 5%, while 6% came from escalators, partially offset by just over 4.5% of churn, the result of decommissioning agreements in Latin America, carrier consolidation in Africa and customer-specific churn in APAC. Finally, our data center segment contributed over $765 million to our total property revenue in 2022, including a record year of new business from CoreSite as I previously mentioned. Moving on, adjusted EBITDA grew around 11% to over $6.6 billion or around 13% on an FX-neutral basis for the year. Growth was supported by solid contributions from Telxius and CoreSite and strong flow-through of top line growth achieved through effective cost management. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 190 basis points as compared to 2021, primarily due to the impacts of the VIL reserves and Sprint churn in the US, higher pass-through revenue due to rising fuel costs and the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by approximately 5.6% and 3.5%, respectively, including over 11% growth on a per share basis in Q4. For the year, both metrics included over 2% in headwinds associated with FX. Attributable AFFO per share of $9.76 exceeded the original 2022 outlook midpoint laid out a year ago by $0.06, despite absorbing the negative impacts of incremental VIL reserves, rate-driven interest costs and FX relative to our initial assumptions. Now before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2023, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, as we've previously communicated, we expect a meaningful step-up in US and Canada organic tenant billings growth, driven by an acceleration in new business backstopped by the comprehensive MLAs we have signed over the last few years together with the sequential improvement in contracted Sprint churn. Internationally, we expect a strong year of organic tenant billings growth across most of our regions driven by continued strength in organic leasing trends, along with contributions from CPI-based escalators, particularly in Europe and Africa. As we've communicated over the past couple of quarters, growth in Latin America will be moderated by churn headwinds associated with a continuation of Telefonica churn in Mexico and Oi churn in Brazil, where we'll see some staggered impacts over the next several years. Second, and as I mentioned earlier, we have factored into our guide an expectation for a continuation in VIL collections volatility, resulting in an assumption of $75 million in revenue reserves for the year. Third, given the unprecedented rise in interest rates over the course of 2022, which saw the one-month LIBOR increased by more than 400 basis points and 10-year treasuries increased by around 250 basis points from the beginning to the end of the year, we expect 2023 to have one-time outsized negative growth headwinds associated with financing costs. Key components driving this assumption include elevated costs on our floating rate debt and to a lesser extent, the refinancing of our 2023 senior note maturities as well as the full year impacts of our 2022 equity-related initiatives, including our common equity issuance and the incremental minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our partnership with Stonepeak. Taken together, we have assumed a roughly 8% headwind to attributable AFFO per share growth associated with financing costs in 2023. Next, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $150 million for property revenue, $64 million for adjusted EBITDA and $47 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2022. And finally, looking beyond the challenges I mentioned associated with interest rates, VIL reserves and FX, our core business continues to demonstrate strong performance and resiliency, representing nearly double-digit year-over-year growth at the attributable AFFO level. While this performance is fueled by the solid organic leasing trends we're seeing across our global portfolio, it's further amplified by exceptional conversion rates through AFFO, achieved through a keen focus on cost management across our business. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving on to the details of slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenues of nearly $10.8 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% or approximately 4% absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023. Our guide includes expected cash revenue growth of around $230 million in the US and Canada, and $245 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions, excluding the 2023 VIL reserves of $75 million. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $55 million of growth in cash revenue to the property segment in 2023. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate a modest FX headwind of just under 1.5% to consolidated growth. Turning to slide 8. We expect organic growth to contribute meaningfully to our property revenue growth assumptions. Starting with the US and Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% or greater than 6% excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes record levels of year-over-year co-location and amendment growth of around $220 million, a nearly 50% increase over the levels achieved in 2022 and a 60% increase as compared to the trailing three-year average. Of the $220 million, over 90% is locked in through MLA-driven use right fee commencements and carryover growth. On the churn side of the equation, after incurring the largest impact of Sprint churn last year, we expect churn of around 3% in 2023, including an approximate 1% impact associated with Sprint, which would represent a year-over-year improvement of over 200 basis points in the segment. Moving to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 2% for the year driven by relatively consistent co-location and amendment activity and continued solid contributions from CPI-based escalators of approximately 8%. This escalator rate does represent a step down from 2022 levels, as we saw inflation in markets like Brazil moderate in 2022 as compared to 2021. As we've previously highlighted, higher churn of around 8% is partially offsetting gross growth due to the expected continuation of Telefonica churn in Mexico and the early part of what we expect to be staggered Oi churn in Brazil. Similar to last year, we do expect to receive some settlement payments from Telefonica over the course of the year, which will be captured outside of the organic tenant billings growth metric. We've assumed approximately $50 million in 2023 payments as compared to the over $80 million we received from Telefonica Mexico and Nextel Brazil in 2022. Turning to Asia Pacific. We are guiding to approximately 4% organic tenant billings growth in 2023, including churn of around 4%, which is around 70 basis points lower than the 2022 churn rate. We expect co-location and amendment growth contributions to ramp up compared to 2022, coming in around 6%, fueled by the rollout of 5G networks. However, it is important to note that the reserves we've assumed for VIL in our guide reside outside of this metric, consistent with past practices. Turning to Europe. 2023 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 7% to 8%, which is slightly lower than 2022 due to the mathematical benefits realized last year, given Telxius was only in the prior year base for a partial year. However, this does suggest a solid acceleration off our Q4 2022 organic growth rate of around 6%, which represents a more normalized comparison. On the co-location and amendment front, we anticipate 2% to 3% growth, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 6%, reflecting the benefits of CPI-linked escalators across the majority of our European footprint. Churn is expected to decline to around 1%, reaping the benefits of the lower churn profile of our recently acquired Telxius portfolio. Finally, in Africa, we expect a solid acceleration off of 2022, with expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9%. This includes co-location and amendment contributions of around 6%, along with escalators of around 10% and expected 450 basis point increase from 2022 levels. This will be partially offset by an expectation of elevated churn of greater than 6%, as carrier consolidation continues to work its way through the financial metrics. Moving on to slide nine. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 4% and around 5%, absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023, while absorbing approximately 1% in FX headwinds. We expect this growth to be achieved through solid cash conversion rates of 85% to 90%, the result of prudent cost controls across the business and the expectations for another strong year from our US services business. Turning to slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to decrease by $0.16 on a reported basis, while remaining flat year-over-year absent the impacts of the 2023 VIL revenue reserves. As mentioned, we expect growth to be meaningfully impacted by financing costs, which include a rate-driven increase to cash interest expense along with the incremental full year impact of minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our US data center business. Together with the common equity share issuance in 2022, financing costs are expected to provide a significant one-time growth headwinds of approximately 8% in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, absent the impact of financing costs, FX and the 2023 VIL reserves, our business is demonstrating solid growth contributions of around 9%. Moving on to slide 11, I'll review our capital plans for 2023 and our balance sheet progress and priorities for the upcoming year. In 2023, we will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders through the growth of our dividend. And subject to Board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $3 billion, representing an approximately 10% year-on-year growth rate on a per share basis. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.7 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. This will largely be spent continuing the success of our new build program internationally, which assumes the construction of around 4,000 sites at the midpoint. We also expect data center capital to increase modestly as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity. Moving to the right side of the slide. As you can see, we made tremendous progress towards strengthening our balance sheet over the course of 2022, putting us ahead of the deleveraging path we committed to with the rating agencies, which actually afforded us the flexibility to repurchase a modest number of our shares in Q4. Throughout 2023, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing financial policies as we execute on our financing plans. This includes the refinancing of maturing debt, while leveraging our strong liquidity position as needed to remain opportunistic as we access the capital markets. Finally, we remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. And our priorities over the course of 2023 and into 2024 remain on deleveraging our balance sheet back down to the three to five times range. Consistent with our recent comments, at this time, we do not see any material M&A in our pipeline that would alter these areas of focus. Turning to slide 12. And in summary, we delivered strong results in 2022, demonstrating the resiliency of our business model in the face of various macro-related and customer-specific challenges. Our global portfolio of assets and operational capabilities continue to prove critical in meeting the growing demands of our customers and the customers they serve. We saw record new build volumes internationally and record leasing within our CoreSite business and experienced a steady acceleration in colocation and amendment growth as we exited 2022, which we expect to continue into 2023. As we look ahead, we expect to further build on the successes of the recent years and leverage our portfolio to drive strong recurring growth on the back of consistent secular technology trends for many years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions. Hey, Michael. Good morning. This is Rod. I'll start here, and Tom can certainly join in. So -- but in the US, the leasing activity is really strong. And our revenue in the US is underpinned through what we refer to as the holistic agreements, which I think everyone is very familiar with. But we've seen contributions from colocations and amendments rise from about $150 million in 2022, up to $220 million in 2023. That drives about a 5% contribution to our organic tenant billings growth. And as Tom mentioned in his previous answer, we see about 90% of that locked in for 2023. And the long-term guidance that Rick asked about, we are continuing to target equal to or greater than 5% between 2023 out to 2027. And a fair amount of that activity, both the underlying revenue and the revenue growth, is locked in as part of the holistic deals. Now of course, as we move beyond 2023, that 90% will come down maybe to about two-thirds or so by the time you get in the outer years. And that's just a function of getting closer to the end of some of the agreements, and chances are some agreements will be rewritten sort of along the way. So we feel really good about the visibility we have into the US leasing market and the strength that we're seeing in the US market, particularly because of our assets and the way that we drive these agreements. Now your question kind of refers to flex. And I think what you mean there is where is the potential upside? And of course, there is a potential upside to the extent that there's faster uptake on 5G utilization in the US. And if that requires carriers to densify the networks a little bit quicker, and we see a faster conversion for colocations and fewer amendments going forward, that could certainly provide some upside. And then depending on just the build of some of the carriers. And certainly, DISH comes to mind as they build a greenfield network to the extent that they go beyond their minimum commitments with us, that could certainly be some upside as well. So I would really kind of watch -- certainly watch DISH. I would watch the other carriers and see the 5G utilization. And some of these new applications come out for 5G, we'll see what kind of bandwidth constraints that puts on networks and when network densification may end up happening. But it's a pretty exciting time in the US market, particularly when you look at the 5G networks and potential applications coming down the pike. So I think that kind of covers off the points around the US leasing. When you think about our international business, we don't have holistic deals in the same way in a material fashion outside the US. They are much more traditional green, more of an a la carte, kind of pay as you go around the globe. So, that's what I would say about that point, Michael. You're welcome. Good morning David I'll take the next one here on the AFFO per share growth. So, you can see in the chart that we laid out, we have FFO per share going from $9.76 to really down to $9.60 on an attributable basis. As we mentioned, the financing costs, you can see on the chart there, the $315 million represents about $0.68 of that or about an 8% headwind. The 405 is what's coming from our regional businesses, including our corporate cost centers. And that 405 represents about a 9% growth. So that's kind of a core growth rate that we're generating from our operating. The FX headwind is about 1%. And then VIL represents about 2% headwind. And when you put it all together, you get to a negative 2% growth. But to the extent that the financing impacts here really are one-time, which we expect, we expect interest to kind of peak this year and then -- in the middle of this year and maybe trend down towards next year, assuming they stay flat or even decline and become a tailwind next year. That certainly would be a good fact. But that could remove that 8% headwind on us. FX and the VIL situation in India, both are somewhat unpredictable. But if you put those aside, we feel really good about our global operating business in that upper single-digit growth rate in this environment. And of course, with these uncertainties around FX and maybe recessions in the US and other places, we'll watch and see how that unfolds. But absent the volatility in India, absent the FX and the financing headwinds, we feel very good about an upper single-digit sort of a growth rate from our operating units. And that's all driven and underpinned by growth in mobile data consumption around the globe and the need for tower space. And our portfolio is just really well positioned to benefit from that. Yes. Thanks. David. When it comes to our build program, Richard, I mean, we're going to build about 4,000 sites this year. That's the expectation. The biggest chunks here really come from Africa and India in the range of 1,600, 1,700 sites each in those areas. In Europe, we're going to drive just over 400. In Latin America, maybe just under 300 sites. So there's an opportunity to build in all of these markets. And we get really good NOI yields in these markets kind of across the board. So it's not just about the volume of sites. Certainly, we like the idea of increasing our footprint Europe, in particular, driving more builds there with very highly credit quality customers in really attractive economies. So the 400 plus, 400 to 500 sites we'll build there are very attractive to us. But as Tom talked about with scaling the core, anywhere where we have management teams and assets and customers, to the extent we can add assets through an internal CapEx program with high NOI yields, it creates a lot of value for our shareholders long-term. It's good for our customers as well. So we think all of these markets are attractive in terms of our ability to build new assets. Yeah. Sounds good, Eric. So when it comes to Latin America, I guess what I would point to is our guide on organic tenant billings growth is a little bit higher than 2%. That comes in a few pieces. The gross new business is going to be in the mid-single digits, let's call it, around 3% or so. We're also seeing higher escalators at around 8%. And we do have a headwind of churn of about 8% as well. That's the bits and pieces in terms of getting into that growth rate. So you can see the churn number is fairly high. We do think it's temporary, and we do think it will work through it over the next couple of years and get back to a more compelling overall growth in the market. And when it comes to the churn pieces in our guide specifically, when you look out here in 2023, Telefonica is really the biggest piece. And I don't want to get too detailed in terms of customers. But I think everyone knows what's happening in Mexico with Telefonica and then joining AT&T as an MVNO there. So that's driving a fair amount of the churn. We're also seeing some churn remaining from American Movil really through the Nextel assets that were purchased down in Brazil. Those are the two things other than smaller churn, smaller customers throughout the region. But it's really the Nextel and the Telefonica in the bigger piece. And then the Oi piece really is going to be out over time. So there's a couple of things that I would say about Oi. Oi in total is about $100 million of revenue for us. It represents about 1% of our overall business. About one-third of that is tied in with their landline business, which we fully expect that the landline business of Oi will keep those sites over time. The other two-thirds, we have, on average, five to six years remaining on the length there. So that will be -- kind of over time, we'll see Oi is not a significant impact today that we're seeing, but that may start unfolding this year and into next as we negotiate with the three players who kind of carved up the Oi. It will probably extend into a multiyear period in terms of getting through Oi. So that's kind of what's happening in Latin America relative to the churn issues. Yes. On the balance sheet, a couple of things that I would say. I mean, we have longstanding percentage policies when it comes to fixed and floating. We run 80-20. We're pretty much there at the end of 2022. We expect to stay in and around that range. I mean, we can be opportunistic. I think you saw it at the very end of 2021 just before interest rates began to rise. We were fairly aggressive in terms of terming out floating rate balances. We got our floating rate percentage down to closer to 10%. With about 90% or just over 90% on fixed, we did that very purposefully to take advantage of the low rates, both in the US bond market and the euro market. And that was just ahead of purchasing the data center business on December 28, 2021. So we can be flexible there. In terms of managing the balance sheet going forward, we have about $3 billion in bonds that we'll refinance this year. We'll look at a variety of opportunities to do that. That could come in the form of getting into the US capital markets that we can do that or parts of that in the European markets. And of course, we'll be balancing short-term and long-term rates. We could stay on the shorter end of the curve and with the expectation that rates may come down in the next couple of years, and then we go out longer when the rates are more attractive. We can also secure some of the debt that's on the balance sheet to the extent we refinance it and maybe carve off some savings from that perspective as well. So there are a lot of opportunities in terms of looking at the market. There's a lot to consider in terms of where we expect rates to head. But as I said earlier in one of my last comments, we do expect that rates will probably peak here in the US this year, maybe even drift down later in the year. And we'll continue to watch the markets and interest rates and economy to see what we expect to be happening next year. But we'll be looking at the full curve and all the different capital opportunities that we have in front of us to make the very best decisions going forward. You\u2019re welcome. Hey, Batya, I'll take the India reserve question. So you can see in our outlook for 2023, we are calling out a specific reserve for VIL of about $75 million. That's up against on a revenue reserve basis from 2022, we reserved close to $100 million for really the last two quarters in 2022. What I can tell you is, the percentage -- I don't want to get into percentages of revenue that they're paying and those sorts of things. But I will highlight that in January, they're paying us a little bit more than they were paying us in the end of 2022. So we are seeing some improvement in terms of the collections through VIL. And we do expect that, that improvement will kind of continue, and we'll collect even a little bit more from a variety of their commitments to us as we look out over the balance of 2023. We do expect them to be getting back closer to and increasing their payments to us towards the end of the year. So we do expect to see some improvements going in that direction. That's kind of what I would say. In terms of the contracts, we haven't really written any MLAs or leasing contracts with them. We have entered into the $200 million convertible debenture, which also have some terms and conditions embedded in it that call out specific time periods in terms of when payments are due. It also has some additional terms and conditions around staying current with leasing fees within the MLAs and those sorts of things. So there's that additional agreement, which gives us a few additional kind of safety nets or safety belts here. But the situation there is volatile. We're focused on trying to support VIL through this period. We were very encouraged by the government conversion. We think that could be the beginning of better things for VIL in terms of raising additional capital going forward. And we're focused on long-term value creation and having VIL as a partner in India over the long term. And maybe on your second question, can you remind me what it was? Yes, I would say, it's really just being opportunistic, kind of, looking at the market. Certainly, India has been volatile over the last few years and maybe even a little bit longer than that. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we look at all of our portfolio assets around the globe kind of on a constant basis and evaluate growth opportunities, valuations and other things. So we are in the process of looking at strategic options in India. We haven't made any decisions at this point, but we are kind of going through a process in evaluating things. And it's really around being opportunistic. We do believe that the Indian market is an interesting market and does hold some upside, but there's also a fair amount of volatility that we have experienced. So we'll be looking at a number of things. And when and if we conclude and make any decisions, we'll certainly let everybody know. You\u2019re welcome. And Nick, maybe I'll just add -- complement on to what Tom said here. As we wait for the edge or work for the edge to develop, the CoreSite business is performing exceptionally well and right in line with our expectations. You heard us talk earlier about the record new business that we achieved in 2022. We see strong demand from enterprise customers on those core data center assets that we have around the country. A few of the key metrics here. We are seeing escalations right around 3% on our rental space, which is right in our target range. We see cash mark-to-market adjustments for 2023 go up beyond where they were in 2022. So, they've gone from about 2% up to maybe 3% to 3.5%. So, that's certainly a good factor. Churn continues to be in and around 6.5%, which is on the low end of our range. Interconnection growth we expect in 2023 to be in the 6% to 8% range, kind of right in line with where we would expect it to be. And our development CapEx is coming in at around $360 million for 2023. And much of that is to replace capacity that we sold in 2022 through those record new business numbers that we will be deploying in 2023 and 2024. Replacing that capacity is really where the CapEx is being deployed. So, we're seeing very good results and really demand from that CoreSite business, again, as we look to work to develop the edge."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Five years ago, when we rolled out the Stand and Deliver strategy that would guide us over the following decade, we emphasized driving the business forward through four key pillars: enhancing operational efficiency, growing our assets and capabilities, investing in innovation and platform extensions and augmenting industry leadership. Since that time, we've seen carriers across our global footprint invest over $300 billion in network assets and methodically deploy next-generation networks to support rapidly increasing data demand in their served markets. Our commitment to execute on each pillar of Stand and Deliver, not only aligns with our customers' needs in this context, but it also enhances American Tower's position to serve as a strategic provider of critical infrastructure for the networks of the future. So before highlighting the key strategic objectives, we'll focus on in 2023 and over the next several years, I'd like to spend a moment reviewing achievements from the past five years that have driven our success to date. On the operational front, we've signed comprehensive master lease agreements with T-Mobile, AT&T, DISH and most recently, Verizon in the United States. These agreements represent a commitment to a mutually beneficial, predictable growth path and strategic alignment between American Tower and its customers, while also demonstrating the value and criticality of our nationwide 43,000-plus site portfolio to support 4G, 5G and future network generations. Such agreements also bring with them efficiency innovations designed to deliver simplicity in leasing processes and accelerated time to market for the carriers. To extend on these benefits, we've invested in technologies to build a holistic standardized data set, mapping the vast majority of our US assets, which can be leveraged to eventually bring application cycle times down to a matter of hours. We believe this type of capability will be a particularly attractive customer value proposition in the context of a 5G densification cycle and one we believe can be scaled across our global footprint over time. Our focus on operational efficiency has extended throughout our international business as well. Notably, since the beginning of 2018, we've invested nearly $350 million, primarily in Africa, on improving site level performance through our Power as a Service program. This includes the installation of lithium-ion batteries and solar arrays for primary and backup power delivery, which has resulted in a sizable reduction in average fuel consumption per site across our African portfolio and has extended the replacement cycles of critical power sources all while providing over a 99.9% average uptime for our customers' networks. At the same time, we've established a centralized procurement organization that aims to drive down material costs. And we've leveraged shared best practices and our scale as a multi-national operator to strengthen our global vendor relationships. By streamlining these critical operational functions, we've been able to continue to drive solid investment returns on our capital deployments and efficiently meet the infrastructure needs of our customers, all against a challenging backdrop of price volatility and supply chain disruptions. In fact, since the start of 2018, we've added nearly 26,000 sites to our international portfolio through new builds, more than two times the volume of the previous five-year period. Today, these sites are contributing approximately $250 million in tower cash flow and an NOI yield of approximately 21%, demonstrating meaningful expansion from the already attractive low double-digit day one yields we typically see on these new build opportunities. On the M&A front, we've executed a number of transactions that have been transformational in terms of delivering additional critical scale in existing and new markets ahead of major network investment cycle, the benefits of which we are seeing in our results and forward-looking expectations today. These include InSite in the United States, the in portfolio in Africa as well as Telxius in Europe and Latin America, which augmented our scale in Germany and provided entry to Spain in a leadership position just as 5G investments were beginning to ramp up on the continent. More recently, through our efforts to selectively expand our platform and position American Tower as a market leader in the next generation of network architecture development, we entered the data center space through the acquisition of CoreSite. CoreSite delivers an interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich platform as well as exposure to a resilient high-demand communications infrastructure business, which we believe will deliver strong performance as demonstrated by a record signed new business in 2022 and provide accretive returns on a standalone basis over time. As importantly, we believe the combination of CoreSite and American Towers platform of distributed tower real estate positions us to enhance the value of our existing assets as the edge proliferates. Finally, I'm particularly proud of the steps we've made towards augmenting our leadership in several areas. Organizationally, we've made ESG core to our operations through initiatives such as our commitment to Science-Based Targets, localized DE&I initiatives designed to facilitate an inclusive organization for our employees and stakeholders and through the growth of our digital communities program, which has now reached more than 400 communities and serves more than 335,000 people across 15 countries. As I mentioned on this call last year, we're also a member of the EDISON Alliance: 1 Billion Lives Challenge, which provides us the opportunity to contribute to the development of affordable and accessible digital healthcare, finance and education solutions for communities in need. Over the past year, we've developed partnerships with healthcare providers that have resulted in the launch of several telehealth locations that provide primary, preventative and specialty teleconsultation services in underserved areas. While this is just one positive first step, we believe that we've achieved over the last year, clearly demonstrates the value we can create and the communities we serve through a commitment to multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. And we hope more organizations will join us in efforts like these over the coming years, which brings us to today and our focus for 2023 and beyond. We believe we're poised to build on and accelerate the successes of Stand and Deliver that we've achieved thus far. As I mentioned in the opening, our teams are focused on key strategic objectives that will continue to guide our operations and management teams in American Tower over the next several years. The first of these is to leverage our premier platform of assets to drive strong recurring growth, both organically and through our disciplined capital allocation framework and our investment-grade balance sheet, as we seek to capture new business opportunities against the backdrop of secular demand trends that remain as strong as ever. We refer to this internally as scale the core. To this end, we expect an acceleration in organic growth in 2023, representing an improvement of around 100 basis points relative to our prior five-year average. Beginning with our US and Canada segment, the benefits of our comprehensive MLAs and ongoing 5G deployments are driving an expectation for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% in 2023, including approximately $220 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growth, which would be a record year for American Tower by a significant margin. We also see a path to solid organic growth in our international segment, led by regions like Europe and Africa, where we're capturing activity from multiple network upgrade and densification cycles and are realizing the benefits of CPI-linked escalators on the vast majority of our leases. This will be complemented by what we expect to be yet another year of solid new build activity, primarily in international markets, where the current 4G and 5G network rollouts continue to drive strong demand for new infrastructure. And in our data centers business, where we're entering 2023 with record backlog, we'll continue to focus on driving increasing growth, both on an organic basis and through high-yield development opportunities that are ongoing today. Operationally, our teams are working to continue to build on the many efficiency and growth initiatives we've developed in recent years, which hits on another key objective within the organization: being the most trusted strategic partner for our customers. The most concrete example of our efforts on this front, probably the long-term multi-market agreement we recently announced with Airtel in Africa, which includes a meaningful new build pipeline, a joint commitment to build in accordance with new low-carbon emissions guidelines, which we're calling green sights and a partnership framework to enhance the impacts of both companies' digital communities and kiosks programs on the continent. This agreement exemplifies the benefits of our scale, best-in-class operations, and ability to deliver innovative solutions, while advancing both American Tower and our customers' long-term sustainability and fossil fuel consumption reduction targets. Going forward, we'll continue to work on building alignments with our global customers to leverage our scale to execute on opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder returns in a sustainable and responsible way. This includes an effort to accelerate our platform extensions. As I mentioned previously, demand trends in the data center space remain robust driven by digital platforms, leveraging distributed computing and by the early stages of a sustained enterprise migration from on-prem to hybrid IT and multi-cloud architectures. As a result, we see a long runway of opportunity to drive strong returns by investing in the expansion of our existing CoreSite campuses and leveraging the open cloud exchange to extend their interconnection-rich ecosystem. At the same time, we're working to position our combined platforms for outsized success as demand for the workloads and compute functions are drawn closer to the end users at the mobile edge. And as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth through platform extensions going forward, we'll continue to focus on how we can leverage our core competencies in real estate, power provision, and connectivity to drive incremental value to the ecosystem while delivering increasing shareholder returns. Meanwhile, as a management team, we're laser-focused on positioning our global teams for the future, while growing and maintaining a healthy cultural foundation. These together represent perhaps our most critical key objectives as our world-class team members are the most valuable asset in American Tower. As we position the company to be a market leader in an evolving landscape, we recognize that developing, empowering and retaining diverse and talented team members is fundamental to our success as a company. Through this lens, we've renewed our focus on management development and institute region-specific programs designed to support a balanced life for our teams amongst many other initiatives. We also appreciate that facilitating a culture that is inclusive and equitable is not only shown to drive better decision-making in business outcomes, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do for the people who dedicate so much of their time to growing this business and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. In summary, the long-term secular demand trends underpinning growth in our industry remain resilient. We believe we're optimally positioned to capitalize on the successes of our Stand and Deliver strategy to date. And we're more energized than ever as we look to execute on our initiatives in 2023 and deliver strong, sustainable returns for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to discuss our 2022 results and expectations for 2023. Rod? Yes. Sure, Simon. You got a lot going on in that question. But let me try to peel it back and then remind me if I left anything out. With regards to scale of the core, it really comes down to really three pieces. One is to just do what we do every day, that's servicing our customers and driving that organic growth. And we've really been very focused on that in the US as you saw our expectations for 2023 and beyond, because those large-scale relationships that we put in place with our -- the critical carriers in the United States are long-term in nature. And so we now have a very predictable growth path in the US. And the US is the foundation really of our entire business. And what I've always said is that we enjoy the benefits of diversification, because there are going to be some markets that are going to grow significantly, others that are going to grow less so simply because the methodology that all of our customers use for build are different. And they all form those different sign waves as we've talked about in the past. And we can -- if you can layer on all those sign paths, you're able to get some predictable rates of growth. And so we're excited about coming out of 2022 strongly. We expect higher rates of growth in 2023 and in particular, within the United States. From a total portfolio perspective, we're constantly looking at where we can maximize value. And we are in 26 countries today, and there could be certain markets there where it may just make sense for us from a number of different perspectives for us to peel back some of those assets. Don't have anything in mind as we speak. We're constantly evaluating it. That's kind of what we do. And with regards to India, India is a market where they're going to have a higher population than China, if not now, very soon. They have huge penetration, huge data usage. And it's a market that we would like to be able to continue to keep our toe in because we continue to believe that there is significant growth there. To the extent that we can bring in a third-party player to monetize the particular part of the asset and reallocate some of that capital in some other parts of the market, we'll look at that. It's purely opportunistic, and we look at every kind of available opportunity as we speak. With regards to our data center business, of course, I had a terrific 2022 record sales in 2022. And they're replenishing capacity where they needed. We've added land in Denver and New Jersey, where we needed some additional runway. But we've got a good amount of capacity in the hopper. We're building out another 30 megawatts of capacity under construction. We actually got one-third of that already pre-leased, and we have 224 megawatts for future development. So there's an incredible demand, as you well know, as we've heard from other competitors in the market for interconnection hubs. And that's what I really refer to as core side. It's not a co-location facility. It's an interconnection hub creating opportunities for new logos. We added over hundred logos last year. And we're really excited about the opportunity and the demand that we see in the market for activity relative to our data center business in the United States. Did I miss anything, Simon? Interesting, Simon. We have a lot of different ways of being able to secure M&A. We demonstrated that really with what we've done in Europe, with our capital, even in the United States with Stonepeak in terms of private capital. So I think the capital is there. For us, yeah, it is a function that our objective is to delever. I really do want to get down to that five times kind of leverage. And so that remains a top priority for the business. But on top of that, we want to continue to feed our build program. We had record build last year. We have a strong build program this year. With regards to the M&A, there's just still a significant difference between the valuations, the bid and the ask. And there's nothing out there that's compelling as we see it today. And so our focus continues to be on, as I said, what we do every day, driving organic growth, driving efficiency. You see we expect margin improvement in 2023 versus 2022 and supporting our build program. Our customers are very active around the world from a build perspective. And I think in the last several years, we brought in like \u2013 we built like 25,000 sites. And so there's a significant opportunity there, and the returns are incredibly compelling on that new build program. So as I said, there's just nothing at this point in time that we see out there that's interesting really from an M&A perspective. And we continue to just keep our head down in terms of funding our build program and delevering our business. You bet. Hey Rick. Actually, Rick, it's going to be very consistent, very linear throughout the year. And so largely, it's a function of the relationships and the agreements that we have in place. But we would expect it to be very consistent in the US throughout the year. Yeah, exactly the same. I mean, it's \u2013 as we have said, as we have predicted, as we have thought, and again, it comes down to largely the relationships that we have with our customers. We see strong demand coming out. I still think we're in the early innings really with 5G. Our customers on average are probably on about half of our sites. So there is a significant amount of opportunity there. But it also comes down to the types of relationships and the arrangements that we have with regards to our MLAs. So we are underscoring really what we had said a year ago relative to growth coming out of 2023 through 2027. Well, I mean, you've got a couple of questions in there. We're not going to \u2013 we're not focused on rolling out a long-term guide at this point, as you would expect. But there have been some significant macro environment changes that happened around the world that we use to underwrite kind of that double-digit expectation, which I think is what you're referring to. But I'm not letting the foot off the gas in the business, okay? We're not changing anything at this point in time. Our core growth, as Rod just walked through, really remains really, really strong. And we don't have any expectations for that kind of growth diminishing. We see kind of 4G, 5G being rolled out across all of our footprints, which really gives us a lot of comfort in terms of being able to suggest that, that growth is going to continue. Now, also having the types of relationships that we do with our customers in the United States helps underpin a lot of that growth. The interest rates, Rod walked through the impact of rates. It's kind of a reset in 2023. I believe it to be kind of more of a one-off, if you will, in 2023. So we remain really bullish on going forward. As I said, I'm not going to talk about long-term guide, but I'm not letting the gas \u2013 letting the foot off the gas at all within the business. With regards to \u2013 of our dividend program, as you all know, you're a REIT expert. Our policy is just followed our REIT TI. And it's been very consistent. We've been able to enjoy double-digit rates of growth on our dividend for the better part of the last 10 years actually, which has been very supportive. And we continue to be \u2013 we continue to feel that our dividend is an important part of our total shareholder return. So we're looking at 10% dividend, as Rod talked about this year. It's difficult really to predict what that might be. It depends upon what we bring into the REIT, what's not in the REIT, obviously, what kind of M&A exists out there. It could drop a little bit to high single digits. But again, we continue to expect it to grow significantly. And as I said, it's an important piece of our overall total shareholder return. You bet. Okay. Dave, you got a bunch of stuff packed in there. Let me start to -- no. Relative to the M&A in India, there's not a direct connect between the two. They are somewhat mutually exclusive types of decisions. And it really becomes, again, part of a broader portfolio kind of conversation relative to what we think may make sense for the portfolio in terms of driving further value over time. India is really just kind of an opportunistic at this point in time. And really, it's -- we're in kind of the exploration mode at this point. A number of things going on there. And to the extent that there is, again, a value creation opportunity for us, we can continue to enjoy the growth of the market and utilize that capital in other parts of the world, including using it to further de-lever, perhaps more -- even more quickly than we would have otherwise thought is not a bad thing. So, there -- I understand the kind of the connection that you're drawing there, but I'm not really looking them in that way. And I really do believe the paths are separate. Thanks. Just adding on to that, one of the really interesting, I think, parts of the build is what we're doing in Africa, because we're really focused on building green sites in Africa with Airtel and really leveraging a lot of the power and fuel competencies that we've created in that market. We brought in solar to over 15,000 sites. We brought over lithium-ion in over 19,000 sites. We've reduced 5 million liters of diesel over the last several years. And so there is an incredible competency that we're building with regards to Power as a Service in that marketplace. And we're able to bring that then on to those green sites that we're building in conjunction with our -- with the agreement with Airtel. So that's a particular interest that we're really excited about over the next couple of years. I'm certain that there are certain pockets of the United States where we're already seeing some densification going on in the marketplace. And so I would expect that to continue as penetration continues with 5G sets. Keep in mind, it's in the carrier's best interest to deploy out 5G, because it's going to lower their overall cost of providing service. And so as activity continues to drive and as applications continue to develop and get deployed, you'll start to see that densification. But -- so I think it is already going on. And I would expect that over the next two to three years, we'll see an increase even in the densification within the market. Also keep in mind that carriers are using slightly higher spectrum bands. And so given the propagation characteristics, they're going to be requiring higher levels of densification as a result of that as well. No, it's really not. As a matter of fact, if you saw the numbers coming in from the field in terms of what they expected to build, it's significantly higher, candidly. And what I -- what we do is, we ratchet that back and look at the opportunity and look at where we can drive the most value there. So there's nothing going on there with regards to the pullback on sites. By the way, we will see different levels of site build in each one of the countries, just like we see different levels of colos, amendments depending upon what densification looks like and what the carriers are looking like. But now I wouldn't read in anything in terms of the pullback on India new builds for 2023. Yes. No, nothing specific. I mean, I -- we have a fair amount of history in the kind of in that particular part of the infrastructure business. We knew what the model was that CoreSite was delivering on with their customers and how significant interconnection was in terms of driving value for their customers as well as for the cloud and service operators, and that demand continues. And it's a significant barrier to entry for others to be able to compete against them. I'm continually incredibly impressed with the team and how they think about returns and how they think about the relationships with the customers. So -- but that wasn't surprise, because I thought that candidly through the entire due diligence process. So I knew the quality of the group. We did enjoy significant growth in 2022, which I think just goes to the strength of the team and strength of the value proposition that they're offering their customers. And we believe that 2023 is going to be another strong year. We still have, as you would expect, a significant amount of energy around what the edge will ultimately look like. We have created an advisory board. We have a lab set up. We have plans to start to look at building out some of that capacity. We've identified about 1,000 sites within the United States that can handle up to over a meg of capacity. And through the relationships that we've been able to develop really through CoreSite with the cloud, we remain really optimistic about what that opportunity is going to look like and how we're going to be able to drive incremental business to our tower site, which is in and of itself has a strong competitive barrier given the ownership that we have of the land and of the site. And so we're very excited about it. There's nothing in our guide relative to performance coming from that activity. And as we've said, it's going to be a multi-year rollout. But we think that as a result of the CoreSite assets as well as our tower assets, we're really uniquely positioned to be a meaningful part of the puzzle as the edge continues to develop. So as I said, I think we would just continue to underscore what we originally had thought, and we're continually working very methodically in terms of trying to become that linchpin for rolling out that kind of capability."

We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As is typical for our third quarter call, my comments today will center on the key technology trends we're seeing across the wireless landscape and how our distributed tower portfolio is positioned to benefit from next-generation network deployment and generate sustained resilient growth, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, I'll provide an update on the CoreSite portfolio of assets, our latest view on the evolution of the mobile life and the progress we are making in advancing our edge strategy, which aims to leverage our distributed tower and land assets, in combination with our interconnected data center portfolio to drive incremental value as network technology evolve. Since the start of 2019, 5G spectrum auctions, mainly in the mid band, have collectively driven over $155 billion in purchase price proceeds across our served market. These acquisitions of large swaths of new spectrum have kicked off what we believe will be at least a decade-long period of network investments, aimed at delivering on the promises of 5G's faster and lower latency applications. We anticipate this will result in $5 billion of incremental annual customer CapEx spend in the United States, on average, as compared to the levels we saw throughout the 4G cycle. Additionally, in the US, the visibility we gained through the comprehensive MLAs we put in place with AT&T, T-Mobile, DISH and most recently, Verizon, supports our expectation that these investments will drive a near-term acceleration in organic new business growth and a sustained level of elevated tower activity over a multi-year period. As we saw during the rollout of 4G, we expect this investment cycle to play out in two broad phases. The first being a coverage phase, through which carriers prioritize upgrading their existing footprint to maximize the percentage of the population having 5G access and begin to benefit from the cost efficiencies associated with their network technology upgrades. Over the last year, we've seen carriers leveraging our presence in nationwide scale to efficiently and aggressively upgrade equipment on our sites, both here in the United States and in several markets across our international footprint to meet those 5G build-out objectives. In the second phase, as consumers adopt advanced 5G-enabled mobile devices and applications, carriers will invest in additional capacity through network densification to facilitate increased mobile data consumption and optimized customer experience. We saw this second phase play out after 4G was launched in the United States around 2010. By coupling the provision of higher bandwidth speed and improved network capabilities with the proliferation of advanced smart connected devices with improved user interfaces, 4G unleashed innovative applications, such as video streaming, mobile gaming, as well as industry redefining application, which is mobile-enabled ride sharing and transportation. The introduction of these new data-intensive applications contributed to an annual consumption growth rate of nearly 50% from 2013 to 2018, requiring carriers to meaningfully invest in the densification of their network. Similarly, we expect our customer's 5G network anticipating delivery times of 5 to 10 times lower latency and increased download speeds up to 100 times to further unlock new capabilities, facilitate consumer and enterprise innovations, enable use cases that will necessitate further proliferation of connected devices and drive higher network throughput. Consider emerging augmented and virtual reality technology as an example, video streaming excluded, primarily because of the advancements achieved through 4G, driving extended destination investment in order to provide users with adequate network quality. Currently, video streaming bandwidth requirements range from a few megabits per second to about 8 megabits per second for HD and up to 25 megabits per second for 4K, depending upon the resolution, eventually working to 50 and closer to 100 megabits per second for 8K videos. Depending on compression schemes and the device requirements, looking ahead to the theoretical max specs for potential future applications of mix reality, we would expect multiple gigabits per second. Again, that is gigabits with the G. Compared to 4G, 5G will offer enhanced resolution, rapid refresh rates, real-time raw midstream with low latency and provides 3 times more bits per hertz spectrum efficiency in the 5G mid band. Even when factoring in all these benefits, we believe rapid mobile data consumption growth, along with the shorter propagation characteristics of mid band spectrum. We'll necessitate a massive 5G densification phase of network investment, greater than what we realized in 4G. As a result, we expect this future capacity as to support sustained growth in our tower business. At the same time, we expect the applications driving these densification efforts to present new neutral host infrastructure opportunities, aimed at minimizing latency and reducing traffic burdens on middle mile network. This is a good segue into a discussion about our CoreSite data center activity and the progress we're making in advancing our edge strategy to support these networks of the future. While the tower business certainly remains healthy and staggered deployment of network generation rollouts across our geographically diverse footprint provide a solid runway for growth over the next decade, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities for value creation through the platform expansion pillar of our stand and deliver strategy. A key element of this pillar is identifying new opportunities that leverage our portfolio of communication assets and our capabilities in managing and redeveloping distributed real estate to provide new multi-tenant neutral host infrastructure model that support the demands of next-generation networks and applications. As we previously communicated, the most apparent opportunity of scale that we see over the next decade is out of the mobile edge, which ultimately solidified our decision to acquire CoreSite at the end of 2021. We still believe this acquisition further positions us to take advantage of the emerging digital transformation enabled by 5G. Having now owned CoreSite for more than three quarters, we couldn't be happier with the performance we're seeing across the business and the use cases driving leasing activity, which we expect to serve as growth catalysts well into the future. Importantly, we're extremely encouraged by the consistently positive customer feedback on this acquisition. Customers continue to view CoreSite as a strong operator in hybrid IT solutions provider with a high-quality ecosystem, which under the American Tower umbrella can now provide more predictable scalability and future incremental value through our combined platform capabilities and expertise. So far in 2022, CoreSite has achieved solid new business volumes, a reflection of the strong demand for the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem, where over 80% of revenues are derived by customers with a variety of interconnections to at least five different and independent customers. This strong demand demonstrates the differentiated value proposition and resiliency of these strategically located and well-integrated assets. We are pleased to see strong new business volumes from enterprises, prioritizing digital transformation to the implementation of hybrid IT solutions, leading the migrations from an on-premise data centers to co-location data centers in major metros. We are also encouraged to see accelerating demand from leading digital platform, seeking to extend compute functionality closer to their users to enable automation, collaboration and address latency-sensitive applications and early indicators supporting our edge evolution thesis. Critical to CoreSite's interconnection-rich ecosystem value proposition is its open cloud exchange platform or OCX. OCX provides CoreSite customers with quick scalability and represents an essential element, as we seek to expand the ecosystem to more distributed points of presence at the edge development. Today, through this automated Layer 2 Ethernet software-defined networking platform, we connect our customer communities within and between our US data centers, and we connect cloud providers to CoreSite's nationwide portfolio. We continue to invest in improving the platform's features and building out the functionality and reach to enable high-performance, hybrid architectures more quickly and securely and at a lower total cost of operation than alternative solutions. More recently, we launched Layer 3 enhanced network services, including virtual routing, cloud connect tiering to service providers and cloud-to-cloud connectivity to leading cloud providers. These enhanced functionalities simplify an enterprise's network hardware or management resources at a lower total cost of ownership. Through continued innovation over time, CoreSite\u2019s vision is to provide customers with single port access to their entire digital supply chain, which we will also expect to be leveraged and extended as the distributed interconnected edge ecosystem develops over time. While the distinctive characteristics of CoreSite's portfolio, including its enhanced capabilities accorded to its OCX platform, represent the critical attribute in advancing our edge strategy, we also see tremendous value in CoreSite's development pipeline. Coresite continues to execute on opportunities to redeploy their cash flow towards high-yielding development project. Customers require additional scale across our footprint. And consequently, over 20% of our data center development under construction is now pre-leased. We also recently announced the acquisition of a purpose-built data center in Southern Florida, MI2, which will be connected to our existing Miami facility, expanding and strengthening our Southeastern footprint, where we have also integrated our legacy data centers in Atlanta and Orlando into the CoreSite ecosystem. As we look further out, we expect workloads to become even more distributed and localized. Therefore, we see the importance of an interconnection hub like CoreSite, increasing as customers look to future-proof their digital businesses who secure, flexible and scalable solution, enabling agile interoperability as businesses shift to more customized hybrid multi-cloud IT environment and importantly, require an extended edge computing presence to support evolving low latency applications. In turn, the mobile edge is emerging as a critical area in the convergence of wireless and wireline network. Over the past year, these 5G deployments in the US have continued at a rapid pace, we've seen elevated emphasis from select wireless carriers with respect to their edge compute strategies and a forging a partnership with cloud and enterprise technology platform to better prepare for the network demands of the future. We see all of this as incremental data points in support of our vision for forthcoming demand of VA. In our view, much like the adoption of the shared tower model, this digital ecosystem over time will be most efficiently provisioned through a distributed neutral host, multi-tenant interconnected edge infrastructure model, reducing the capital intensity and total cost of ownership among MNOs, cloud, landline and enterprise players and critically, facilitating a seamless universal customer experience for end users. Our tower portfolio, coupled with our US data center business, represents a distributed portfolio of real estate with accessibility to robustly interconnected core network and native access to cloud on rent. We believe the combination of these platforms will be critical as data processing extends from the core to the edge. With that migration, more distributed and localized points of presence, along with transit costs and low latency considerations, will become essential over time, providing American Tower and CoreSite, the potential to win across multiple edge layers. To date, our team has identified over 1,000 sites within our existing US tower portfolio that we see as shovel-ready candidate for mobile edge deployment based on location, parcel footprint, land control and existing fiber and power access. Over the next several months, we plan to break ground on our first 1 megawatt edge facility and an owned tower site to build upon our understanding of market demand and customer requirements, design a blueprint that can be rolled out at scale as the edge ecosystem developed and demonstrate the differentiated value proposition at American Tower and CoreSite can offer potential customers. As always, any future development will go through our disciplined approach to evaluating the market opportunity and economic returns of edge deployments at scale, as well as an evaluation of the best way to finance future deployment, which could potentially include strategic partnerships, financial sponsors or both. In short, the strategic partnerships emerging between the MNOs and cloud service providers, the evolution of latency-driven edge leasing activity within our CoreSite portfolio and our interactions with the architects, the low latency networks of the future have only strengthened our conviction. The edge will represent a meaningful opportunity to drive incremental value to our assets over the long term. Although, this architecture will take time to develop, American Tower is positioning itself as a critical future provider and partner for cloud, MNO and enterprise customers, as wireless and wireline network convergence accelerates over time. In the meantime, we'll seek opportunities to advance our learnings, including through the development of an edge application integrator and our participation in various trials in edge industry form. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to understand emerging trends, network requirements and customer needs. All aimed at strengthening our option to win at the edge over the long term. In closing, demand for wireless connectivity continues to grow across the globe, where despite the dynamic challenges we've all navigated over the past several years, the need for reliable wireless and broadband access has been elevated in importance as a means to advance global economies and the populations they serve. With carriers aggressively deploying their valuable spectrum assets, we will begin to realize the true capabilities of 5G. And with that, we expect to see new innovations that will change the way we live for the next decade and beyond. Our effort to build scale across our global footprint of macro tower assets for over the past two decades, combined with our continuous focus on platform expansion and innovation has position American Tower to support our customers in meeting the continued acceleration in mobile data demand, while leading the way in the development of new infrastructure model that will be essential in meeting the needs of applications of the future and drive incremental value on our assets over time. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full year 2022 cost. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you heard from Tom, we are very encouraged by the technological trends that we believe will drive continued secular growth in the industry and a long runway of growth for American Tower. Before I walk through the details of our Q3 results and revised outlook, I will first touch on several key trends and developments from the quarter, including the evident strength of leasing demand across our footprint and renewed collections volatility in India. First, we continue to see 4G and 5G investments driving strong demand across our footprint, which translated into solid gross leasing growth in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue and further accelerate, particularly in the US as we approach 2023. We complemented sequential growth in organic leasing with nearly 1,600 newly constructed sites internationally earning on average, low double-digit returns on day one, driven by those same trends. Additionally, demand for hybrid IT solutions optimally suited for our US data center portfolio remains healthy. This resulted in another strong quarter of leasing results, fueled by digital platforms and the continuation of enterprises moving their IT infrastructure from on-premises to interconnection-rich co-location facilities with direct cloud access, such as CoreSite. Next, we closed on Stonepeak's initial $2.5 billion investment in our US data center business in August, which was upsized by another $570 million after quarter end at the same valuation in terms. This further highlights the differentiated characteristics and value of the CoreSite portfolio, while establishing a partnership through which we will execute on our US data center strategy. Also, we signed a new comprehensive MLA with Verizon at the end of August, which is expected to allow Verizon to efficiently accelerate their 5G network deployment over a multiyear period. This agreement is yet another data point, illustrating the fundamental long-term criticality of our portfolio as our customers seek to leverage our scale and capabilities to rapidly deploy nationwide 5G and further provides tangible evidence that our US business should have a solid runway of growth over the next several years. Additionally, we executed a new multi-market MLA with Airtel Africa, our largest customer in the region. Under this new long-term agreement, we've secured attractive terms across our existing Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Niger portfolio, along with a contractually committed, attractive build-to-suit pipeline to support Airtel Africa's 5G deployment, among other opportunities. Importantly, with Airtel Africa, we share a focus on advancing wireless connectivity in a sustainable manner, which is represented in this agreement through a commitment to deploy low-carbon sites and expand our digital communities program. Our agreements with both Verizon and Airtel Africa, two of our largest customers is the latest demonstration of the value our global scale and operational capabilities as a company, both in markets and across borders, can unlock to provide mutually beneficial solutions for American Tower and our partners. With that, I'd like to take a moment to address some uncertainty related to collections arising out of our India operations and how this event has affected our results for Q3 and revised outlook for 2022. In Q3, collections from Vodafone Idea or VIL, fell short of our billings. And the customer has also communicated an expectation for that trend to continue through the balance of this year. As a result, we found it prudent to take certain reserves associated with VIL in Q3 and against the anticipated Q4 billing shortfall in our revised guidance. Consequently, our full year expectations now include approximately $95 million in additional revenue reserves, about half of which was booked in Q3. It also includes the removal of a $30 million bad debt reversal that was assumed in our prior guidance. Together, these result in a reduction in adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO of $125 million. At this time, our revised outlook for net income does not assume any additional impairment charges associated with the goodwill and intangibles that we currently have on the books associated with VIL, as the shortfall in cash flows is being viewed as temporary. It should also be noted that VIL did express a commitment to revert back to 100% payment at the start of 2023 and repay outstanding pass-through balances, which could potentially provide an opportunity to reverse certain reserves we've taken in the future.  VIL has also laid out a set of strategic steps that we will closely monitor on its path to more stabilized and consistent payment, including the conversion of its AGR interest into equity held by the Indian government. However, until then, we expect continued uncertainty in collections for VIL and have reflected those risks in our revised outlook.  In the meantime, we are actively working with VIL on the path forward, which could potentially include converting a portion of its existing AR into optionally convertible notes, which we believe can better secure our receivables. We will incorporate new developments that unfold over the next several months into our guidance for 2023 on this February's call. With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q3 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see our Q3 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion increased by over 10% and over 14% on an FX-neutral basis as compared to the prior year period. Growth was primarily driven by solid organic leasing, execution on our international new build program in contributions from our US data center business, partially offset by headwinds of approximately 2% associated with revenue reserves taken in India during the quarter, as discussed, and another 2% from Sprint related churn. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the US and Canada, as expected, net organic growth was slightly positive at 0.3%, including a sequential step-up in gross organic new business of $38 million, a meaningful acceleration from $31 million in Q2 in our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020. As we have indicated throughout the year, we expect this acceleration to continue into Q4 and even further in 2023, where a large portion of our growth will be contractually committed through our comprehensive MLAs. Escalators were 2.8%, which, consistent with last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impact of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwinds year-over-year and will step down in Q4 as the largest tranche of contractual Sprint churn will have lapped in our year-over-year growth metric. On the international side, organic growth was 6.1%. Starting with Europe, we saw growth of 6%, which is now at a more normalized level with healthy largely in the prior year base. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 6.8%, modestly higher than prior expectations due to some delays in anticipated churn now pushed to later in the year.  Growth also included another strong quarter of gross organic new business standing at 7.5%, putting Africa on track for its best organic new business year on record and continuing past quarter trends, we saw the strong organic leasing activity complemented with an active new build program, constructing just over 250 sites in the quarter as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns on our capital deployments across the region.  Moving to Latin America. Organic growth was 8.2%, which includes approximately 9. 7% from escalations. Growth through organic new business and escalations was partially offset by another quarter of elevated churn, primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreement, which we expect to further accelerate in Q4, as highlighted on previous earnings calls. In APAC, we saw organic growth of 1.9%, in line with our expectations, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with 1,200 sites constructed during the quarter. Turning to slide seven. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 6% or over 8.5% on an FX-neutral basis, to over $1.6 billion, with strong revenue growth and cost controls, partially offset by the negative impacts of Vodafone Idea revenue reserves and Sprint related churn, together representing approximately 6% headwinds to growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.5%, down 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint churn, along with higher pass-through revenue resulting from fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share decreased by approximately 3% and 5%, respectively, with each including a 3% headwind associated with FX. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint related churn, combining for an over 8% offset to otherwise strong and resilient performance across our global operations. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, performance remains solid across our portfolio as demand for wireless connectivity and the rollout of next-generation networks are fueling strong new business volumes across our regions. Together with the straight-line benefit from our recently executed MLAs, along with pass-through increases, primarily related to power and fuel, we're raising our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in outlook to outlook headwind of $45 million, $22 million and $13 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO, respectively. Finally, and as noted earlier, we have incorporated approximately $125 million in incremental reserves relative to our prior outlook, associated with Vodafone Idea. This includes $95 million in revenue reserves, split between Q3 and Q4, and the removal of our previous assumption for incremental bad debt reversals of around $30 million. As I mentioned, Vodafone Idea has communicated its intention to resume full recurring payments in 2023. However, at this time, we believe these adjustments to be appropriate for the current year. With that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on slide eight, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $70 million at the midpoint. This outperformance includes straight-line upside of approximately $65 million, primarily associated with our recently executed Verizon and Airtel Africa MLAs and $77 million in higher pass-through revenue driven by fuel costs, along with various non-recurring benefits, including accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, which we now expect to total approximately $85 million for the full year. Our guidance raise was also supported by a recurring revenue upside across several of our segments, helping to contribute to some modest revisions to our organic tenant billings growth outlook, which I'll touch on shortly. This outperformance was partially offset by the $95 million in incremental revenue reserves related to Vodafone Idea and $45 million in FX. Moving to Slide 9, you will see our organic tenant billings growth expectations, while we are reiterating our prior outlook on a consolidated basis and for the US and Canada as well as APAC segment, we are slightly revising our expectations for International, Europe, Latin America and Africa. For international, we are raising our organic growth to approximately 6.5%, up from approximately 6% previously. In Europe, we have adjusted our organic growth expectations to greater than 8% from approximately 9% in our prior outlook, where we expect new business commencements to shift further into 2023. In Latin America, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up modestly from approximately 7% in our prior guidance, reflecting a continuation of the CPI-linked escalation benefits in the region. In Africa, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up from approximately 6.5% in our prior guidance, reflecting the delays we're seeing in anticipated churn, as I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, in Latin America and Africa, consistent with prior assumptions, we anticipate consolidation-driven churn events to drive a sequential decline in growth as we exit the year resulting in what we expect to be approximately 4% and 5.5% organic tenant billings growth in Q4, respectively, with some carryover impacts as we head into 2023. Lastly, in the US and Canada, where we are reiterating our prior organic growth outlook, we expect to see Q4 organic tenant billings growth of around 4%, with further improvement in 2023, backstopped by the contractual visibility afforded through our comprehensive MLAs with the big three carriers plus DISH. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA midpoint by $30 million as compared to our prior outlook, where we're seeing a high conversion of property revenue outperformance delivered through prudent cost controls and continued elevated services volumes, providing meaningful upside as compared to our previous expectations. These benefits are partially offset by the $125 million associated with incremental reserves assumed for Vodafone Idea, as previously discussed along with $22 million in FX. Turning to Slide 11. We are lowering our attributable AFFO guidance by $40 million or $0.09 on a per share basis. This adjustment is attributable to the Vodafone Idea reserves we have taken, which is translating into approximately $0.27 per share of downside, offsetting what was otherwise very strong performance across our business, which represented approximately $0.20 per share outperformance on an FX-neutral basis. Moving to Slide 12. Let's start by taking a look at our capital deployment expectations for the year, which are slightly updated compared to our prior outlook and continue to reflect our focus on driving sustained AFFO per share growth and shareholder returns. Within our capital deployment plan, we are reiterating our expectations to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion, subject to Board approval towards our 2022 dividend. With regard to CapEx, we are reducing our total midpoint by $45 million, with redevelopment decreasing by $35 million and start-up decreasing by $10 million, the result of some timing adjustments and savings as compared to our prior plan. We continue to assume the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites globally and roughly $300 million towards our US data center business, largely associated with development spend. As we've highlighted in the past, we continue to generate exceptional returns through our discretionary CapEx program, which remains largely financed through the redeployment of locally generated cash flows. We view our ability to allocate nearly $1.8 billion towards accretive high yield projects as a strategic benefit after years of building scale and credibility with our global customer base in a compelling way to further build scale and drive accretion for years to come. Finally, although we have not incorporated into our revised guide, I'd like to highlight that with the additional capacity we currently have as we outpace our delevering plan, we expect to opportunistically restart our share buyback program. Given recent market performance and the strong fundamentals we anticipate in our business over the long-term, we see this as a great opportunity to further drive shareholder value particularly against other forms of capital deployment in our current line of sight. Moving to the right side of the slide, I'd like to take a moment to review the progress we have made since the start of the year to shore up our balance sheet and liquidity position, particularly in light of the market volatility and unprecedented rise in rates occurring over the past several months. As you recall, we closed the CoreSite acquisition using our bank facilities and term loans, temporarily moving our leverage to 6.8 times and our floating rate exposure to 31% at the end of 2021. Since that time and against the challenging backdrop, we have strategically termed out short-term borrowings through common equity, private capital and senior unsecured note offerings, all at solid terms and pricing. Today, our leverage stands at 5.5 times ahead of plan with floating rate exposure of around 20%, in line with our long-term target. Looking ahead, we continue to believe this profile is appropriate given the predictable and contractual nature of our cash flows while providing us exposure to pre-payable debt, which offers us financial flexibility as we execute on our delevering path, and access to the typical low rate short-term curve. In addition, a meaningful portion of our floating rate debt is euro denominated, which provides us a natural hedge and diversified capital structure, while also offering pre-payable debt at terms more competitive than those currently available in the US. Although we anticipate 2023 as it appears today, we'll present certain growth challenges stemming from the current rate environment, we feel comfortable with our proven approach to balance sheet management. This includes our ability to manage our upcoming 2023 maturities where we expect our diversified sources of capital and solid liquidity position to provide near-term financing flexibility, allowing us to opportunistically access the markets against a healthy and constructive backdrop. In short, we believe our investment-grade balance sheet and the long-standing policies we've established position us well to navigate various economic cycles, including the challenges we're all facing today. And although we may see certain growth headwinds in the near-term, we believe our investment-grade credit rating and continued access to diversified sources of capital coupled with our focus on maintaining robust liquidity will serve as a more meaningful competitive advantage over the next several years. Finally, on slide 13. And in summary, we had a strong Q3 across our global business with solid operating performance, accelerated leasing and resilient demand even in the face of a challenging economic backdrop. During the quarter, the long-term critical nature of our portfolio of assets in positioning to drive sustained and compelling growth was further highlighted through key customer agreements with Verizon and Airtel Africa and the closing and subsequent upsizing of our Stonepeak partnership in our US data center business. Although, we will likely experience some growth pressure in the near-term associated with the continued rise in interest rates, we see our investment-grade balance sheet, liquidity and diversified sources of capital as a key competitive advantage as we execute on our growth strategy over the next decade and beyond. As we look ahead and over the long term, we are excited about the positioning of our global portfolio of communications assets as our customers augment and extend their networks to meet exploding data-driven demand and believe our global scale and proven capabilities have us positioned to drive incremental sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you. Good morning. Tom, it was good to hear your discussion about the opportunities from 5G and particularly from CapEx capacity additions as well as the favorable comments around near-term and medium-term US leasing trends. Can you square that with the CapEx trajectory at the likes of Verizon and T-Mobile where they're expecting a significant step down? I know it's not a one-for-one relationship. But how do you expect this to evolve? Because I think there's a sense here that there will be some deceleration as we've seen sort of in prior 4G cycle. So what's the offset to those lower CapEx numbers?\nTom Bartlett: Simon, having seen the trends from the carriers for many, many years. I mean, there's always volatility in their overall spend. It will largely be a function of device penetration and application development that will require the further densification that we believe in the \u2013 in their deployment as well. So it's not a kind of a one-for-one type of a \u2013 I think a relationship with our overall growth. And also keep in mind that with our agreements that we have in place, we have these broad comprehensive agreements which really locked in a lot of that revenue growth for us. And so 70%, 80% of our revenue growth, we have tremendous visibility into as a result of those master lease agreements. And I would expect the carriers, as I said, to be investing in their market that demand develops. And I would expect, given the benefits of 5G that each and every one of us are going to be using significantly more levels of spectrum, if you will, over time. So I said it's not a one-for-one. Our MLAs do give us that kind of visibility. And overtime, I would expect higher levels of CapEx being spent on 5G, just as we saw being 4G versus 3G.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTom Bartlett: You bet.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Barden, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Two, if I could. The first, Rod just digging into the biggest moving part in the guidance, the Vodafone Idea relationship. I guess two pieces to that. One is, is there's been a lot of press about them versus, say, Bharti, Indus, and maybe trying to renegotiate tower rates to 'soften' the impact on costs? And then, could you kind of talk about what you're willing to give on that front? And then, also, you talked about converting your accounts receivable to notes. I mean, historically, towers have never been impacted by bankruptcies. How is converting accounts receivable to notes a better option than just kind of continuing the way you are as a tower company with your counterparty there? And then I guess the last piece maybe, Tom, on capital allocation, the conversation about buybacks, I'm sure, is welcome, but there's been a lot of conversation over the last two years about AMT's ambitions in Europe and scaling there, and there's obviously some pretty big deals and I think that obviously cost of capital is a huge issue, your equity where it is as an issue. Could you categorically rule in or rule out what your position on expanding Europe is right now? Thanks.\nRod Smith: Hey, David. Good morning.\nTom Bartlett: Yeah, Rod, why don't you start and take the first couple and then I'll take the third.\nRod Smith: Yes, that sounds good. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well. So regarding India and Vodafone and kind of their current situation, their desire to renegotiate some MLAs, I don't want to get into too many of the terms and conditions, certainly not want to talk about things that haven't happened yet in the future. But, I can tell you, they are in a predicament with their balance sheet, which everyone knows about, there's been a lot of press regarding that. So they're looking for a number of things from us in terms of supporting them. Discounts may be one of them, we'll certainly talk about that with them kind of over time. But I don't want to get into the details in terms of what we may or may not be willing to do. If we were to provide any kind of a disc that just run through our churn numbers and would be in our guidance. I don't expect any changes through our organic net billings guidance for this year negotiation or renegotiation with Voda. So -- and if anything changes next year, we'll update you for next year. I guess shifting, David, to the note, we did convert 200 -- or we have the option to convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable, this is not a new investment, into Voda. I want to make sure that, that's clear. But existing accounts receivable that's on the balance sheet, we have signed an agreement where this $200 million could become a convertible note, but that is contingent on some conditions happening in India, both the government converting their near-term interest into -- I think, everyone is aware of that playing out. So that have to happen first. And if that does happen, then we could convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable into a convertible note. The reason that's interesting to us, number one, is it helps shore up Voda a little bit. It basically moved the account receivable and, let's say, an MLA default into more of a financial interest and it helps them get some equity and maybe some additional debt on their book. So we want to support them and help them through this difficult time. So that certainly is one reason. The other thing, having this note, it does have predefined payment time frame in it, which is a little bit more certain than what you might see in typical accounts receivable that's hanging on the balance. And then we also have the option, at our option, to convert it to equity, which is another way for us to liquidate that favorable balance. So I think it increases our flexibility. It increases the probability in the near-term to convert it to cash, and that's really the reason we're interested in doing it. So -- and it helps Voda. So all those things, we did really looked at it and it makes a lot of sense for us, and I think it makes sense in terms of our willingness to support them.\nTom Bartlett: And I guess, Dave, just regards to your last question on Europe and the opportunistic buyback program that Rod talked to. First of all, with regards to our Celsius asset base and integration, we're really very pleased with what we've experienced over the last year. I mean you've seen the growth rates and the success that we've had there and the relationship that we've actually built with Telefonica. So that's all gone incredibly well. With regards to further scaling, we do have a sizable build-to-suit program that we are in the midst of, and we see even more a build-to-suit opportunity coming forward, I think particularly in Germany. With regards to further M&A, we stepped away really just due to the sellers' expectations of value. There's just a significant delta between the bid and the ask at this time. Now over time, that may change. There's just a lot of volatility economically or obviously, you will know around the world. And so there's just a significant amount of space between the bid and the ask. And so we've really stepped away from those. We're always asked to participate in them. And so you always see in the media that American Tower is doing this or that but -- and I know you well know that we're incredibly disciplined in terms of how we look at valuation. And given the terms and conditions of some of these transactions as well as the expectations of -- from a pricing perspective, we just don't see the value creation in those opportunities at this time. As I said, maybe that will change over time. I would hope over the next 12, 18 months, you might see some change there. But right now, not. And so we're going to continue to not to focus off the organic growth, working with our customers in the region. Drop in our build-to-suit program, which has been an incredibly terrific way for us to be able to grow inorganically within the business. As Rod said, at some very attractive yields. And really support our customers in the market and enjoy the growth that way.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you both, Tom and Rod. Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, David.\nRod Smith: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg Williams, Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. One is how much of the raise in guidance the $142 million in straight line was related to the Verizon MLA, if any? And second 1 is just dovetailing off of the M&A discussions, what is your appetite for M&A that's not tower-related? Now that you think about augmentor data centers, we've heard possible Asia data centers are of interest or even US fiber. And I'm just curious of your thoughts. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Hey, Rod, why don't you take the first one, and then I'll take the second.\nRod Smith: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Greg, for the question. So the straight line increases that you see in our in our outlook here, we have an increase of straight line of about $65 million built into our property revenue guide. That's really split between the new Verizon deal as well as the deal over in in Africa with Airtel Africa. I don't want to break down that in too much detail and give you the piece parts, but it's really those two deals that make up.\nTom Bartlett: And Greg, with regards to M&A on the data center side, as we said all along, we are very focused on developing the US market. I mean CoreSite's got a terrific presence in the United States. And with our tower portfolio here in the United States, we want to be able to enjoy the benefits of the CoreSite activity, as I highlighted, and as Rod highlighted itself, but also really be able to bring together this overall notion that we have in terms of developing that edge capability that we'll be realizing out the sites themselves, at our tower sites themselves. And so when you're seeing all this, again, noise about buying data centers and things outside of the United States, that's not where we're looking. That's not where our focus is. And if you take a look at the capital that's being spent on the business because we do have a fair amount of development going on within the CoreSite, within the data center activity, it's largely driven just from the cash flow that the business is generating. So the $200 million to $300 million that that we're investing back into the data center business in terms of providing more capability going forward, not just in our OCX platform, but also in space itself is just being driven by the $300-plus million of AFFO that the business is generating itself. So US is our chessboard as we speak, relative to our data center activity.\nGreg Williams: Great. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you both.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: The next question is from Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Can you provide a little bit more color on the carrier activity that you're seeing in Europe, given the macro backdrop, I think some carriers are pulling back on CapEx. How do you think this will drive the growth into next year? And another question on AFFO, I know we'll get full guidance next year, but a lot of moving parts going into 2023 with US accelerating, but higher interest costs and FX. Can you provide a general view on your expectations for your AFFO into next year? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. Thanks, Batya. I'll give you a quick update on Europe here. So we are seeing really strong growth in Europe as you've heard us talk about consistently throughout the balance and the activity is really split across the markets and across the carry. So we're seeing good activity with all the carriers there. I don't want to talk about carrier to carry, but I will just call out that we are seeing 101 begin to build a new park there. We are beginning to see leasing activity. We certainly expect that to ramp up towards the later part of this year and be a much more meaningful contributor next year. The one thing we'll see, we are pulling back our guide a little bit in Europe, but organic in -- growth. That really is just a delay in terms of timing on some certain leases that we have in our pipeline. We're seeing that shift up a little bit into -- later into Q4 and even some of the things later into Q4 shifting into next year. So that's really what you're seeing from that perspective. And remind me the second part of your question was it AFFO guide?\nBatya Levi: Yeah, into 2023 if you have a general guidance that you expect the AFFO per share to grow double digits. How should we think about 2023?\nRod Smith: Yeah. I think -- I mean, I think you should think about 2023 as a challenging year for us. I think everyone knows the interest rates are rising rapidly here, probably more rapidly than most people expected as we head into the end of this year. That is a noticeable material headwind for us in the AFFO line heading into -- so that will be a challenge. That certainly will take us off of our target AFFO growth. I don't want to get into too many specifics. But I think you guys have probably enough information to kind of work the numbers. And when you look at the rate of increase on interest line for us with the interest rates rising that will be a challenge. When we get -- the other challenge for next year is the timing of equity raise, we'll have the full new equity to 10 million shares kind of running in the numbers next year with the early in half of this year. So the comp is a difficult comp from that perspective. I do think when you get out to '24 and beyond, we are seeing really good support for leasing revenue in around the globe. Particularly in the US, you've heard us say we're acceleration of new business from co-location and amendment activity. That acceleration continues. We expect to end this year very strongly coming in very close to that $150 million of co-location new business in the US.  And we're seeing that accelerate into next year on a run rate basis, which is also underpinned by our long-term MLAs. So, we have really high visibility into next year. So we expect to see a meaningful step-up in US co-location and amendment revenue into next year. And that puts us firmly on-track for our long term and particularly to the US organic growth averaging 5% from '23 out to '27.  And that includes some impact from the -- which is about 100 basis points. So without that, you'd be at about 6%. We're firmly on track for that beginning next year and going forward because of that nice acceleration, that strong demand we're seeing in the US.\nBatya Levi: Thank you.\nRod Smith: Thank you.\nOperator: Question is from Michael Rollins, Citi. Please go ahead. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Just curious, as you're looking out over the next 12 to 24 months, can you frame just some of the friction points around whether it's market consolidation that you're seeing or some of just structural issues for maybe things that customers are working through?  And just how to think about the magnitude and timing of those headwinds, maybe relative to some of the other things that you've noted around the build-to-suit opportunities and the organic improvement in demand?\nTom Bartlett: Michael, let me -- maybe I'll -- I can start with that, Rod. I mean that's kind of an open-ended question there. You have when you start to think about what's going on around the world. I think the backdrop here is still the technology, right? And the backdrop is still the demand for broadband wireless. We've seen it through several technology cycles, and that's really driving the ongoing capital that all of our customers are looking to commit over the next several years. And so that provides, I think, a real stable platform for growth. And as Rod kind of went through all the numbers, we're seeing that, right? And we're seeing 5G being deployed in more and more markets. We've seen the growth rates accelerate here in the United States. We expect that to continue into 2023. You've seen the strong growth coming from many of our other markets as well, particularly in Europe and Africa, really a lot of significant activity going on in the market.  You've also seen our customers aligning themselves more closely with us. These longer-term strategic master lease agreements that we put in place, the one that we've talked about with Verizon, the other one that we've talked about with Airtel. I mean these are long-term contracts with well-capitalized companies. There are still spot of churn that we have going on in the market. A lot of activity in Latin America with some consolidation, particularly in Brazil and Mexico that Rod kind of walked through. And so we'll see a heightened level of churn in Latin America over the next 12 months to 18 months. We've seen some consolidation going on in Africa. But then again, we've been able to really largely work through all of that churn and still sizably increase the growth in each one of those markets. So I don't see any seismic shifts, if you will, over the next 12 months to 18 months. Yeah, we are in a rising interest rate environment. We're in an inflationary time around the world. The good news is that, we have long-term contracts and those very high inflationary markets. We've got escalators based on CPI and inflation in those areas. The other element, I think, within our business is we're well diversified. And so while we're perhaps taking a market that might be growing slower in another market, we'll be increasing the growth. And so it's offsetting some of the shortfall that you might see in other markets. I mean, we've talked about this in the past. It our carriers invest kind of like a sine wave, right? I mean, it's heavy investment and then they \u2013 it's less investment as they're tuning their network and then it's a higher investment. We continue to see that. We've seen that through 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and we'll see that through 5G. Our customers aren't going to be building the networks before they see the demand. And so that's going to be a function of device penetration is going to be a sign of application development. I mean, I talked about the two phases. You well know this, in terms of network deployment, first getting the coverage and then we're going to see further densification and sales splitting as their customers are utilizing the network. And with higher band spectrum, we're going to see an even increased level of densification just because of the propagation characteristics of the bands. So I do think that kind of a long rambling answer for you, perhaps. But I mean, the core is the underlying technology and the desire for our customers and their countries themselves and their citizens to really be able to significantly increase their overall usage in wireless data. And so as a result, that provides, I think, a real kind of protection for us particularly when we're looking at these long-term agreements.\nRod Smith: Hey, Michael, this is Rod. I just add...\nTom Bartlett: Hopefully, that answers your question.\nRod Smith: Yes. And Michael, I'll just add, in terms of the churn, the near-term, one thing that you will see is our churn rates are actually coming down from Q3 to Q4. So globally, we \u2013 in our 2.6% Q3 organic tenant billings growth, it was about $5.5% -- 5.4% that was cancellations or churn. That's going to step down to about 4% in Q4, which will end up driving our organic tenant billings growth for Q4, up from that mid-2s up to over \u2013 well over 4, certainly, which is really good. And that 4.4 in Q4 is what helps us drive that 3% for the full year. And in the US, you're seeing that churn drop in the US. So the good news here is, we're through the big bulk, the initial bulk of Sprint churn, you're going to see organic tenant billings growth for Q4 in the US at around 4%, which will be getting us back to where we really want to be longer term. And then in the international markets, we do have some, as Thomas saying some churn events, some elevated churn. Those churn events will be temporary as certain countries go through a little consolidation. But you will see from Q3 to -- from Q3 to Q4, churn will step up by about 100 basis points, going from about a little under 5% to up end of the 5 churn in the international markets. And the only thing I'd call out specifically is in Latin America, you will see -- that's where a bulk of that temporary churn will begin to hit. So you will see a step up in our churn rates in Latin America going from about 5% in Q3, up to a little over 8% in Q4. And that's all the normal churn that that we've all talked about that you guys know is coming. Some of that will persist into next year as well, particularly in Latin America.\nMichael Rollins: That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you.\nRod Smith: You bet. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Ric Prentiss, Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nTom Bartlett: Hey, Ric. Good morning.\nRic Prentiss: Hey. Hey, I want to follow-up on a couple of questions. One following up on Simon's question about CapEx. If we think about the US. Is part of the reason maybe you guys are so confident that the US leasing goes up in 4Q and then goes up and accelerating to 2023 possibly to do with the timing? Your Verizon MLA, your positioning of when you were getting contracts from DISH and that visibility that you talked about, Tom. Just trying to think, is some of this that it's very visible to you, it's really kind of more timing related?\nTom Bartlett: Well, yes, I mean, Ric, absolutely. And as I mentioned with Simon, given kind of the MLA structure we have in place, it's kind of irrelevant in terms of that capital spend from our perspective, right? I mean because we already have the kind of the rates and the pricing kind of locked in for a long-term period. Now having said that, when I back up, I also believe that, that capital is going to be spent over time. And that could be a timing issue as well. It's all a function of customer demand and application development and device penetration. And so when you have those all locked in, you're going to see our customers physically spending on their networks because they have to. They're not going to want to see any decline in quality of service. And so they're going to want to meet this demand and stay ahead of the curve as they traditionally have. And so -- but from an AMP perspective, you're exactly right, timing is not that relevant to us just because of the construct of the agreements that we have in place.\nRic Prentiss: Right. And if you're not seeing any air pocket out there that's been some of the concern in the marketplace because of high interest rates or because of inflation, maybe turns into recession at least on the US side and the carrier spend with you, it sounds?\nTom Bartlett: No, we haven't. We have not.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And last question for me is a follow-up on some of David's questions. The stock buyback, what would trigger that? What else has to happen to trigger the stock buyback? That obviously will require some funding that could affect back on to the interest rate side. And second question with that is, was your $570 million upsizing from some peak kind of expected in the guidance also?\nTom Bartlett: Well, I mean, from our standpoint, and then I'll let kind of Rod step in here. We continue to look at the opportunities to delever as well as to look at supporting our equity. And given the movements candidly in the equity I think that there's some opportunities there to be able to generate some value. And so it will be a balance between the two. We talked about M&A and M&A kind of given the delta between the bid may ask kind of around the world. I think that's less focus, candidly, at this point in time. And so we'll look at our NAV and we'll look at it versus our share price. And well, as we always have, look at the kind of the most attractive ways of being able to drive AFFO per share.\nRod Smith: Yes. And Rick, maybe I would add to that, just from a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter here at 5.5 times levered post this -- the CoreSite acquisition, we were as high as 6.8. So I'll just remind you and everyone else we have. We did start out higher than our target leverage range, which is 3 to 5 times. We work through plans with the rating agencies to delever -- our investment-grade credit rating. That is critical to us. That's very important. We take leverage very seriously. That's why we've been able to delever as quickly as we have, going down from that 6.8 to 5.5. I'd also tell you that the 5.5 is -- we're comfortably lower than the delevering plan that we've agreed with the rating agency. So that puts us in a pretty good position. The plans that we've agreed with the rating agencies did not contemplate or include the $570 million. So that additional capacity that we have to either further delever well, well ahead of the delevering plan, or we can put it to use in a different way. So that's what we'll be looking at. When you think about the $570 million from Stonepeak, that is in our guidance in terms of the mechanics and the way it runs through our numbers. But it's important to point out that it is a benefit when it comes to our ability to delever. And then, of course, when we think about what we do with that capacity or any other capital capacity that we have available to us, we'll always put a share buyback up against our own internally generated net asset value of the company and what we look at in terms of the share value. We're also balancing the analysis around the cost of debt and how we drive better AFFO per share accretion, either paying down our revolving credit lines or buying back shares. So there's a lot of math, as you know, that goes into that. So we expect to be flexible and opportunistic as we evaluate what we do with our capital. And I do think that you could see us do both, continue to delever at a furious pace as well as buy back some shares when we think that's appropriate.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. Thanks for that extra color. Stay well, guys.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Rick\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Matt Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one housekeeping and one broader question. On the housekeeping side, maybe just to go back to the Stonepeak $570 million raise. How does that impact the minority adjustments? I think it's been about $50 million typically between consolidated and proportionate AFFO. Just wondering how that may change in light of the incremental funding from Stonepeak. And then secondly, I think you've kind of answered this in terms of the US, but I'm wondering more broadly, as you think about tighter financial conditions, stronger US dollar, weaker foreign currencies, is that weighing at all on any international customers or regions investment plans, just given some of the lower presumable purchasing power as they head into 2023? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Rob, do you want to cover the MI question and I can talk more broadly?\nRod Smith: Yes. So we took in another $570 million from Stonepeak as an additional investment into our CoreSite business. So the original investment of $2.5 billion gave them basically a current ownership of about 22%, almost 23% of the business there. And then with their additional $570 million, that's going to pop up to about 28% to 29% ownership. And that is for the pieces of those investments that are actually equity from day one. You may recall from some of our disclosures, there are some pieces of those investments that are preferred, which will convert to equity their mandatory converts over a full year period. So they will convert to equity. When that happens, then their ownership will jump up from the 28% to 29% up to about 36%. The way to think about the MI impacts here, when you get to Q4 -- hit the run rate, you're going to see about $150 million of Q4 exit run rate for the European minority then, and you'll see about $60 million or so for the Stonepeak minority interest. That will all run through the minority interest section. On these preferred notes that we have with Stonepeak, you'll see another $45 million that will be interest that will run through the interest line, but you want to keep that in mind as well. So that puts us at a run rate of about a little over $200 million of MI as we exit Q4, $200 million, $210 million.\nTom Bartlett: And Matt, on the second question, relative to the impact of what's going on around the world, on our customers outside of the United States. Interestingly enough, we haven't seen anything of significance that would give me the sense that they're going to be slowing down on their build programs around the world. Now who knows what that might look like going into 2023 and 2024. But they have the same level of energy that we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months. Now we are also protected just because of the diversification of markets and diversification of customers. And so as a result of that, we are actually able to avert a particular issue in one area or another. And also keep in mind, as I mentioned in my remarks that our customers have spent almost $160 billion on spectrum. And so they don't -- they want to monetize that $160 billion and be able to get out into the market as fast as they possibly can. So we are seeing, as I said, the continued robust deployment of capital in the markets. And we continue to support them. And we see also -- again, a lot of build to suit activity in the market as well, which is also an indication of their willingness and ability to spend.\nMatt Niknam: That\u2019s great. Thank you both.\nTom Bartlett: You bet.\nRod Smith: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi. This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up in Latin America. You're expecting a little bit higher churn. Will that impact any new activity, or can you still see new activity growth continue through their -- despite the higher churn? And then also on the services side, it remains pretty solid. Are you seeing anything changing the trajectory of the services business, or do you think it will continue to stay pretty steady?\nTom Bartlett: Rod, why don't you take those two?\nRod Smith: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Tom. Richard, I think when you talk about Latin America, we are expecting higher levels of churn, but pretty consistent levels of that gross new biz. And we're also complementing that with higher levels of escalator, which are driven by local CPI in the region. So those two things are pretty solid. We'll see where inflation goes and how the trajectory of our escalator in that region may change over time. But there is solid consistent new activity in Latin America despite the fact that there is a little consolidation churn happening in some of the markets there. And then when it comes to services, we're in another great year in services we're going to be up in the mid $200 million, we raised our guidance at the gross margin level by about $20 million. So we are going to be in that mid $200 million range for services revenue. That continues to come through at really nice margins in the mid-50s, 54%, 55% at the gross margin level. So our services business is performing exceptionally well and has proven to be very resilient. And that is because the US carriers continue to be very active. I'm not going to guess in terms of where it's going to go in coming years. But to the extent that the activity levels stay high, we'll continue to see really solid high services. Well, there's a chance I could pull back as the timing of activity from the carriers kind of ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. So we'll see what happens next. But we're going to be up in the mid-200s this year in services. All the carriers are active, and we're maintaining really healthy margins in the mid-50s.\nRichard Choe: Great. Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: And that concludes our questions.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAdam Smith: Great. Thank you, everyone. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Have a great day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you heard from Tom, we are very encouraged by the technological trends that we believe will drive continued secular growth in the industry and a long runway of growth for American Tower. Before I walk through the details of our Q3 results and revised outlook, I will first touch on several key trends and developments from the quarter, including the evident strength of leasing demand across our footprint and renewed collections volatility in India. First, we continue to see 4G and 5G investments driving strong demand across our footprint, which translated into solid gross leasing growth in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue and further accelerate, particularly in the US as we approach 2023. We complemented sequential growth in organic leasing with nearly 1,600 newly constructed sites internationally earning on average, low double-digit returns on day one, driven by those same trends. Additionally, demand for hybrid IT solutions optimally suited for our US data center portfolio remains healthy. This resulted in another strong quarter of leasing results, fueled by digital platforms and the continuation of enterprises moving their IT infrastructure from on-premises to interconnection-rich co-location facilities with direct cloud access, such as CoreSite. Next, we closed on Stonepeak's initial $2.5 billion investment in our US data center business in August, which was upsized by another $570 million after quarter end at the same valuation in terms. This further highlights the differentiated characteristics and value of the CoreSite portfolio, while establishing a partnership through which we will execute on our US data center strategy. Also, we signed a new comprehensive MLA with Verizon at the end of August, which is expected to allow Verizon to efficiently accelerate their 5G network deployment over a multiyear period. This agreement is yet another data point, illustrating the fundamental long-term criticality of our portfolio as our customers seek to leverage our scale and capabilities to rapidly deploy nationwide 5G and further provides tangible evidence that our US business should have a solid runway of growth over the next several years. Additionally, we executed a new multi-market MLA with Airtel Africa, our largest customer in the region. Under this new long-term agreement, we've secured attractive terms across our existing Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Niger portfolio, along with a contractually committed, attractive build-to-suit pipeline to support Airtel Africa's 5G deployment, among other opportunities. Importantly, with Airtel Africa, we share a focus on advancing wireless connectivity in a sustainable manner, which is represented in this agreement through a commitment to deploy low-carbon sites and expand our digital communities program. Our agreements with both Verizon and Airtel Africa, two of our largest customers is the latest demonstration of the value our global scale and operational capabilities as a company, both in markets and across borders, can unlock to provide mutually beneficial solutions for American Tower and our partners. With that, I'd like to take a moment to address some uncertainty related to collections arising out of our India operations and how this event has affected our results for Q3 and revised outlook for 2022. In Q3, collections from Vodafone Idea or VIL, fell short of our billings. And the customer has also communicated an expectation for that trend to continue through the balance of this year. As a result, we found it prudent to take certain reserves associated with VIL in Q3 and against the anticipated Q4 billing shortfall in our revised guidance. Consequently, our full year expectations now include approximately $95 million in additional revenue reserves, about half of which was booked in Q3. It also includes the removal of a $30 million bad debt reversal that was assumed in our prior guidance. Together, these result in a reduction in adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO of $125 million. At this time, our revised outlook for net income does not assume any additional impairment charges associated with the goodwill and intangibles that we currently have on the books associated with VIL, as the shortfall in cash flows is being viewed as temporary. It should also be noted that VIL did express a commitment to revert back to 100% payment at the start of 2023 and repay outstanding pass-through balances, which could potentially provide an opportunity to reverse certain reserves we've taken in the future.  VIL has also laid out a set of strategic steps that we will closely monitor on its path to more stabilized and consistent payment, including the conversion of its AGR interest into equity held by the Indian government. However, until then, we expect continued uncertainty in collections for VIL and have reflected those risks in our revised outlook.  In the meantime, we are actively working with VIL on the path forward, which could potentially include converting a portion of its existing AR into optionally convertible notes, which we believe can better secure our receivables. We will incorporate new developments that unfold over the next several months into our guidance for 2023 on this February's call. With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q3 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see our Q3 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion increased by over 10% and over 14% on an FX-neutral basis as compared to the prior year period. Growth was primarily driven by solid organic leasing, execution on our international new build program in contributions from our US data center business, partially offset by headwinds of approximately 2% associated with revenue reserves taken in India during the quarter, as discussed, and another 2% from Sprint related churn. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the US and Canada, as expected, net organic growth was slightly positive at 0.3%, including a sequential step-up in gross organic new business of $38 million, a meaningful acceleration from $31 million in Q2 in our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020. As we have indicated throughout the year, we expect this acceleration to continue into Q4 and even further in 2023, where a large portion of our growth will be contractually committed through our comprehensive MLAs. Escalators were 2.8%, which, consistent with last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impact of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwinds year-over-year and will step down in Q4 as the largest tranche of contractual Sprint churn will have lapped in our year-over-year growth metric. On the international side, organic growth was 6.1%. Starting with Europe, we saw growth of 6%, which is now at a more normalized level with healthy largely in the prior year base. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 6.8%, modestly higher than prior expectations due to some delays in anticipated churn now pushed to later in the year.  Growth also included another strong quarter of gross organic new business standing at 7.5%, putting Africa on track for its best organic new business year on record and continuing past quarter trends, we saw the strong organic leasing activity complemented with an active new build program, constructing just over 250 sites in the quarter as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns on our capital deployments across the region.  Moving to Latin America. Organic growth was 8.2%, which includes approximately 9. 7% from escalations. Growth through organic new business and escalations was partially offset by another quarter of elevated churn, primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreement, which we expect to further accelerate in Q4, as highlighted on previous earnings calls. In APAC, we saw organic growth of 1.9%, in line with our expectations, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with 1,200 sites constructed during the quarter. Turning to slide seven. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 6% or over 8.5% on an FX-neutral basis, to over $1.6 billion, with strong revenue growth and cost controls, partially offset by the negative impacts of Vodafone Idea revenue reserves and Sprint related churn, together representing approximately 6% headwinds to growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.5%, down 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint churn, along with higher pass-through revenue resulting from fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share decreased by approximately 3% and 5%, respectively, with each including a 3% headwind associated with FX. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint related churn, combining for an over 8% offset to otherwise strong and resilient performance across our global operations. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, performance remains solid across our portfolio as demand for wireless connectivity and the rollout of next-generation networks are fueling strong new business volumes across our regions. Together with the straight-line benefit from our recently executed MLAs, along with pass-through increases, primarily related to power and fuel, we're raising our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in outlook to outlook headwind of $45 million, $22 million and $13 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO, respectively. Finally, and as noted earlier, we have incorporated approximately $125 million in incremental reserves relative to our prior outlook, associated with Vodafone Idea. This includes $95 million in revenue reserves, split between Q3 and Q4, and the removal of our previous assumption for incremental bad debt reversals of around $30 million. As I mentioned, Vodafone Idea has communicated its intention to resume full recurring payments in 2023. However, at this time, we believe these adjustments to be appropriate for the current year. With that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on slide eight, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $70 million at the midpoint. This outperformance includes straight-line upside of approximately $65 million, primarily associated with our recently executed Verizon and Airtel Africa MLAs and $77 million in higher pass-through revenue driven by fuel costs, along with various non-recurring benefits, including accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, which we now expect to total approximately $85 million for the full year. Our guidance raise was also supported by a recurring revenue upside across several of our segments, helping to contribute to some modest revisions to our organic tenant billings growth outlook, which I'll touch on shortly. This outperformance was partially offset by the $95 million in incremental revenue reserves related to Vodafone Idea and $45 million in FX. Moving to Slide 9, you will see our organic tenant billings growth expectations, while we are reiterating our prior outlook on a consolidated basis and for the US and Canada as well as APAC segment, we are slightly revising our expectations for International, Europe, Latin America and Africa. For international, we are raising our organic growth to approximately 6.5%, up from approximately 6% previously. In Europe, we have adjusted our organic growth expectations to greater than 8% from approximately 9% in our prior outlook, where we expect new business commencements to shift further into 2023. In Latin America, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up modestly from approximately 7% in our prior guidance, reflecting a continuation of the CPI-linked escalation benefits in the region. In Africa, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up from approximately 6.5% in our prior guidance, reflecting the delays we're seeing in anticipated churn, as I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, in Latin America and Africa, consistent with prior assumptions, we anticipate consolidation-driven churn events to drive a sequential decline in growth as we exit the year resulting in what we expect to be approximately 4% and 5.5% organic tenant billings growth in Q4, respectively, with some carryover impacts as we head into 2023. Lastly, in the US and Canada, where we are reiterating our prior organic growth outlook, we expect to see Q4 organic tenant billings growth of around 4%, with further improvement in 2023, backstopped by the contractual visibility afforded through our comprehensive MLAs with the big three carriers plus DISH. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA midpoint by $30 million as compared to our prior outlook, where we're seeing a high conversion of property revenue outperformance delivered through prudent cost controls and continued elevated services volumes, providing meaningful upside as compared to our previous expectations. These benefits are partially offset by the $125 million associated with incremental reserves assumed for Vodafone Idea, as previously discussed along with $22 million in FX. Turning to Slide 11. We are lowering our attributable AFFO guidance by $40 million or $0.09 on a per share basis. This adjustment is attributable to the Vodafone Idea reserves we have taken, which is translating into approximately $0.27 per share of downside, offsetting what was otherwise very strong performance across our business, which represented approximately $0.20 per share outperformance on an FX-neutral basis. Moving to Slide 12. Let's start by taking a look at our capital deployment expectations for the year, which are slightly updated compared to our prior outlook and continue to reflect our focus on driving sustained AFFO per share growth and shareholder returns. Within our capital deployment plan, we are reiterating our expectations to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion, subject to Board approval towards our 2022 dividend. With regard to CapEx, we are reducing our total midpoint by $45 million, with redevelopment decreasing by $35 million and start-up decreasing by $10 million, the result of some timing adjustments and savings as compared to our prior plan. We continue to assume the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites globally and roughly $300 million towards our US data center business, largely associated with development spend. As we've highlighted in the past, we continue to generate exceptional returns through our discretionary CapEx program, which remains largely financed through the redeployment of locally generated cash flows. We view our ability to allocate nearly $1.8 billion towards accretive high yield projects as a strategic benefit after years of building scale and credibility with our global customer base in a compelling way to further build scale and drive accretion for years to come. Finally, although we have not incorporated into our revised guide, I'd like to highlight that with the additional capacity we currently have as we outpace our delevering plan, we expect to opportunistically restart our share buyback program. Given recent market performance and the strong fundamentals we anticipate in our business over the long-term, we see this as a great opportunity to further drive shareholder value particularly against other forms of capital deployment in our current line of sight. Moving to the right side of the slide, I'd like to take a moment to review the progress we have made since the start of the year to shore up our balance sheet and liquidity position, particularly in light of the market volatility and unprecedented rise in rates occurring over the past several months. As you recall, we closed the CoreSite acquisition using our bank facilities and term loans, temporarily moving our leverage to 6.8 times and our floating rate exposure to 31% at the end of 2021. Since that time and against the challenging backdrop, we have strategically termed out short-term borrowings through common equity, private capital and senior unsecured note offerings, all at solid terms and pricing. Today, our leverage stands at 5.5 times ahead of plan with floating rate exposure of around 20%, in line with our long-term target. Looking ahead, we continue to believe this profile is appropriate given the predictable and contractual nature of our cash flows while providing us exposure to pre-payable debt, which offers us financial flexibility as we execute on our delevering path, and access to the typical low rate short-term curve. In addition, a meaningful portion of our floating rate debt is euro denominated, which provides us a natural hedge and diversified capital structure, while also offering pre-payable debt at terms more competitive than those currently available in the US. Although we anticipate 2023 as it appears today, we'll present certain growth challenges stemming from the current rate environment, we feel comfortable with our proven approach to balance sheet management. This includes our ability to manage our upcoming 2023 maturities where we expect our diversified sources of capital and solid liquidity position to provide near-term financing flexibility, allowing us to opportunistically access the markets against a healthy and constructive backdrop. In short, we believe our investment-grade balance sheet and the long-standing policies we've established position us well to navigate various economic cycles, including the challenges we're all facing today. And although we may see certain growth headwinds in the near-term, we believe our investment-grade credit rating and continued access to diversified sources of capital coupled with our focus on maintaining robust liquidity will serve as a more meaningful competitive advantage over the next several years. Finally, on slide 13. And in summary, we had a strong Q3 across our global business with solid operating performance, accelerated leasing and resilient demand even in the face of a challenging economic backdrop. During the quarter, the long-term critical nature of our portfolio of assets in positioning to drive sustained and compelling growth was further highlighted through key customer agreements with Verizon and Airtel Africa and the closing and subsequent upsizing of our Stonepeak partnership in our US data center business. Although, we will likely experience some growth pressure in the near-term associated with the continued rise in interest rates, we see our investment-grade balance sheet, liquidity and diversified sources of capital as a key competitive advantage as we execute on our growth strategy over the next decade and beyond. As we look ahead and over the long term, we are excited about the positioning of our global portfolio of communications assets as our customers augment and extend their networks to meet exploding data-driven demand and believe our global scale and proven capabilities have us positioned to drive incremental sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Hey, David. Good morning. Yes, that sounds good. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well. So regarding India and Vodafone and kind of their current situation, their desire to renegotiate some MLAs, I don't want to get into too many of the terms and conditions, certainly not want to talk about things that haven't happened yet in the future. But, I can tell you, they are in a predicament with their balance sheet, which everyone knows about, there's been a lot of press regarding that. So they're looking for a number of things from us in terms of supporting them. Discounts may be one of them, we'll certainly talk about that with them kind of over time. But I don't want to get into the details in terms of what we may or may not be willing to do. If we were to provide any kind of a disc that just run through our churn numbers and would be in our guidance. I don't expect any changes through our organic net billings guidance for this year negotiation or renegotiation with Voda. So -- and if anything changes next year, we'll update you for next year. I guess shifting, David, to the note, we did convert 200 -- or we have the option to convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable, this is not a new investment, into Voda. I want to make sure that, that's clear. But existing accounts receivable that's on the balance sheet, we have signed an agreement where this $200 million could become a convertible note, but that is contingent on some conditions happening in India, both the government converting their near-term interest into -- I think, everyone is aware of that playing out. So that have to happen first. And if that does happen, then we could convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable into a convertible note. The reason that's interesting to us, number one, is it helps shore up Voda a little bit. It basically moved the account receivable and, let's say, an MLA default into more of a financial interest and it helps them get some equity and maybe some additional debt on their book. So we want to support them and help them through this difficult time. So that certainly is one reason. The other thing, having this note, it does have predefined payment time frame in it, which is a little bit more certain than what you might see in typical accounts receivable that's hanging on the balance. And then we also have the option, at our option, to convert it to equity, which is another way for us to liquidate that favorable balance. So I think it increases our flexibility. It increases the probability in the near-term to convert it to cash, and that's really the reason we're interested in doing it. So -- and it helps Voda. So all those things, we did really looked at it and it makes a lot of sense for us, and I think it makes sense in terms of our willingness to support them. Thanks. Yes, thanks. Thanks, Greg, for the question. So the straight line increases that you see in our in our outlook here, we have an increase of straight line of about $65 million built into our property revenue guide. That's really split between the new Verizon deal as well as the deal over in in Africa with Airtel Africa. I don't want to break down that in too much detail and give you the piece parts, but it's really those two deals that make up. Yeah. Thanks, Batya. I'll give you a quick update on Europe here. So we are seeing really strong growth in Europe as you've heard us talk about consistently throughout the balance and the activity is really split across the markets and across the carry. So we're seeing good activity with all the carriers there. I don't want to talk about carrier to carry, but I will just call out that we are seeing 101 begin to build a new park there. We are beginning to see leasing activity. We certainly expect that to ramp up towards the later part of this year and be a much more meaningful contributor next year. The one thing we'll see, we are pulling back our guide a little bit in Europe, but organic in -- growth. That really is just a delay in terms of timing on some certain leases that we have in our pipeline. We're seeing that shift up a little bit into -- later into Q4 and even some of the things later into Q4 shifting into next year. So that's really what you're seeing from that perspective. And remind me the second part of your question was it AFFO guide? Yeah. I think -- I mean, I think you should think about 2023 as a challenging year for us. I think everyone knows the interest rates are rising rapidly here, probably more rapidly than most people expected as we head into the end of this year. That is a noticeable material headwind for us in the AFFO line heading into -- so that will be a challenge. That certainly will take us off of our target AFFO growth. I don't want to get into too many specifics. But I think you guys have probably enough information to kind of work the numbers. And when you look at the rate of increase on interest line for us with the interest rates rising that will be a challenge. When we get -- the other challenge for next year is the timing of equity raise, we'll have the full new equity to 10 million shares kind of running in the numbers next year with the early in half of this year. So the comp is a difficult comp from that perspective. I do think when you get out to '24 and beyond, we are seeing really good support for leasing revenue in around the globe. Particularly in the US, you've heard us say we're acceleration of new business from co-location and amendment activity. That acceleration continues. We expect to end this year very strongly coming in very close to that $150 million of co-location new business in the US.  And we're seeing that accelerate into next year on a run rate basis, which is also underpinned by our long-term MLAs. So, we have really high visibility into next year. So we expect to see a meaningful step-up in US co-location and amendment revenue into next year. And that puts us firmly on-track for our long term and particularly to the US organic growth averaging 5% from '23 out to '27.  And that includes some impact from the -- which is about 100 basis points. So without that, you'd be at about 6%. We're firmly on track for that beginning next year and going forward because of that nice acceleration, that strong demand we're seeing in the US. Thank you. Hey, Michael, this is Rod. I just add... Yes. And Michael, I'll just add, in terms of the churn, the near-term, one thing that you will see is our churn rates are actually coming down from Q3 to Q4. So globally, we \u2013 in our 2.6% Q3 organic tenant billings growth, it was about $5.5% -- 5.4% that was cancellations or churn. That's going to step down to about 4% in Q4, which will end up driving our organic tenant billings growth for Q4, up from that mid-2s up to over \u2013 well over 4, certainly, which is really good. And that 4.4 in Q4 is what helps us drive that 3% for the full year. And in the US, you're seeing that churn drop in the US. So the good news here is, we're through the big bulk, the initial bulk of Sprint churn, you're going to see organic tenant billings growth for Q4 in the US at around 4%, which will be getting us back to where we really want to be longer term. And then in the international markets, we do have some, as Thomas saying some churn events, some elevated churn. Those churn events will be temporary as certain countries go through a little consolidation. But you will see from Q3 to -- from Q3 to Q4, churn will step up by about 100 basis points, going from about a little under 5% to up end of the 5 churn in the international markets. And the only thing I'd call out specifically is in Latin America, you will see -- that's where a bulk of that temporary churn will begin to hit. So you will see a step up in our churn rates in Latin America going from about 5% in Q3, up to a little over 8% in Q4. And that's all the normal churn that that we've all talked about that you guys know is coming. Some of that will persist into next year as well, particularly in Latin America. You bet. Thanks, Michael. Yes. And Rick, maybe I would add to that, just from a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter here at 5.5 times levered post this -- the CoreSite acquisition, we were as high as 6.8. So I'll just remind you and everyone else we have. We did start out higher than our target leverage range, which is 3 to 5 times. We work through plans with the rating agencies to delever -- our investment-grade credit rating. That is critical to us. That's very important. We take leverage very seriously. That's why we've been able to delever as quickly as we have, going down from that 6.8 to 5.5. I'd also tell you that the 5.5 is -- we're comfortably lower than the delevering plan that we've agreed with the rating agency. So that puts us in a pretty good position. The plans that we've agreed with the rating agencies did not contemplate or include the $570 million. So that additional capacity that we have to either further delever well, well ahead of the delevering plan, or we can put it to use in a different way. So that's what we'll be looking at. When you think about the $570 million from Stonepeak, that is in our guidance in terms of the mechanics and the way it runs through our numbers. But it's important to point out that it is a benefit when it comes to our ability to delever. And then, of course, when we think about what we do with that capacity or any other capital capacity that we have available to us, we'll always put a share buyback up against our own internally generated net asset value of the company and what we look at in terms of the share value. We're also balancing the analysis around the cost of debt and how we drive better AFFO per share accretion, either paying down our revolving credit lines or buying back shares. So there's a lot of math, as you know, that goes into that. So we expect to be flexible and opportunistic as we evaluate what we do with our capital. And I do think that you could see us do both, continue to delever at a furious pace as well as buy back some shares when we think that's appropriate. Thanks, Rick Yes. So we took in another $570 million from Stonepeak as an additional investment into our CoreSite business. So the original investment of $2.5 billion gave them basically a current ownership of about 22%, almost 23% of the business there. And then with their additional $570 million, that's going to pop up to about 28% to 29% ownership. And that is for the pieces of those investments that are actually equity from day one. You may recall from some of our disclosures, there are some pieces of those investments that are preferred, which will convert to equity their mandatory converts over a full year period. So they will convert to equity. When that happens, then their ownership will jump up from the 28% to 29% up to about 36%. The way to think about the MI impacts here, when you get to Q4 -- hit the run rate, you're going to see about $150 million of Q4 exit run rate for the European minority then, and you'll see about $60 million or so for the Stonepeak minority interest. That will all run through the minority interest section. On these preferred notes that we have with Stonepeak, you'll see another $45 million that will be interest that will run through the interest line, but you want to keep that in mind as well. So that puts us at a run rate of about a little over $200 million of MI as we exit Q4, $200 million, $210 million. Thanks Matt. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Tom. Richard, I think when you talk about Latin America, we are expecting higher levels of churn, but pretty consistent levels of that gross new biz. And we're also complementing that with higher levels of escalator, which are driven by local CPI in the region. So those two things are pretty solid. We'll see where inflation goes and how the trajectory of our escalator in that region may change over time. But there is solid consistent new activity in Latin America despite the fact that there is a little consolidation churn happening in some of the markets there. And then when it comes to services, we're in another great year in services we're going to be up in the mid $200 million, we raised our guidance at the gross margin level by about $20 million. So we are going to be in that mid $200 million range for services revenue. That continues to come through at really nice margins in the mid-50s, 54%, 55% at the gross margin level. So our services business is performing exceptionally well and has proven to be very resilient. And that is because the US carriers continue to be very active. I'm not going to guess in terms of where it's going to go in coming years. But to the extent that the activity levels stay high, we'll continue to see really solid high services. Well, there's a chance I could pull back as the timing of activity from the carriers kind of ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. So we'll see what happens next. But we're going to be up in the mid-200s this year in services. All the carriers are active, and we're maintaining really healthy margins in the mid-50s."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As is typical for our third quarter call, my comments today will center on the key technology trends we're seeing across the wireless landscape and how our distributed tower portfolio is positioned to benefit from next-generation network deployment and generate sustained resilient growth, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, I'll provide an update on the CoreSite portfolio of assets, our latest view on the evolution of the mobile life and the progress we are making in advancing our edge strategy, which aims to leverage our distributed tower and land assets, in combination with our interconnected data center portfolio to drive incremental value as network technology evolve. Since the start of 2019, 5G spectrum auctions, mainly in the mid band, have collectively driven over $155 billion in purchase price proceeds across our served market. These acquisitions of large swaths of new spectrum have kicked off what we believe will be at least a decade-long period of network investments, aimed at delivering on the promises of 5G's faster and lower latency applications. We anticipate this will result in $5 billion of incremental annual customer CapEx spend in the United States, on average, as compared to the levels we saw throughout the 4G cycle. Additionally, in the US, the visibility we gained through the comprehensive MLAs we put in place with AT&T, T-Mobile, DISH and most recently, Verizon, supports our expectation that these investments will drive a near-term acceleration in organic new business growth and a sustained level of elevated tower activity over a multi-year period. As we saw during the rollout of 4G, we expect this investment cycle to play out in two broad phases. The first being a coverage phase, through which carriers prioritize upgrading their existing footprint to maximize the percentage of the population having 5G access and begin to benefit from the cost efficiencies associated with their network technology upgrades. Over the last year, we've seen carriers leveraging our presence in nationwide scale to efficiently and aggressively upgrade equipment on our sites, both here in the United States and in several markets across our international footprint to meet those 5G build-out objectives. In the second phase, as consumers adopt advanced 5G-enabled mobile devices and applications, carriers will invest in additional capacity through network densification to facilitate increased mobile data consumption and optimized customer experience. We saw this second phase play out after 4G was launched in the United States around 2010. By coupling the provision of higher bandwidth speed and improved network capabilities with the proliferation of advanced smart connected devices with improved user interfaces, 4G unleashed innovative applications, such as video streaming, mobile gaming, as well as industry redefining application, which is mobile-enabled ride sharing and transportation. The introduction of these new data-intensive applications contributed to an annual consumption growth rate of nearly 50% from 2013 to 2018, requiring carriers to meaningfully invest in the densification of their network. Similarly, we expect our customer's 5G network anticipating delivery times of 5 to 10 times lower latency and increased download speeds up to 100 times to further unlock new capabilities, facilitate consumer and enterprise innovations, enable use cases that will necessitate further proliferation of connected devices and drive higher network throughput. Consider emerging augmented and virtual reality technology as an example, video streaming excluded, primarily because of the advancements achieved through 4G, driving extended destination investment in order to provide users with adequate network quality. Currently, video streaming bandwidth requirements range from a few megabits per second to about 8 megabits per second for HD and up to 25 megabits per second for 4K, depending upon the resolution, eventually working to 50 and closer to 100 megabits per second for 8K videos. Depending on compression schemes and the device requirements, looking ahead to the theoretical max specs for potential future applications of mix reality, we would expect multiple gigabits per second. Again, that is gigabits with the G. Compared to 4G, 5G will offer enhanced resolution, rapid refresh rates, real-time raw midstream with low latency and provides 3 times more bits per hertz spectrum efficiency in the 5G mid band. Even when factoring in all these benefits, we believe rapid mobile data consumption growth, along with the shorter propagation characteristics of mid band spectrum. We'll necessitate a massive 5G densification phase of network investment, greater than what we realized in 4G. As a result, we expect this future capacity as to support sustained growth in our tower business. At the same time, we expect the applications driving these densification efforts to present new neutral host infrastructure opportunities, aimed at minimizing latency and reducing traffic burdens on middle mile network. This is a good segue into a discussion about our CoreSite data center activity and the progress we're making in advancing our edge strategy to support these networks of the future. While the tower business certainly remains healthy and staggered deployment of network generation rollouts across our geographically diverse footprint provide a solid runway for growth over the next decade, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities for value creation through the platform expansion pillar of our stand and deliver strategy. A key element of this pillar is identifying new opportunities that leverage our portfolio of communication assets and our capabilities in managing and redeveloping distributed real estate to provide new multi-tenant neutral host infrastructure model that support the demands of next-generation networks and applications. As we previously communicated, the most apparent opportunity of scale that we see over the next decade is out of the mobile edge, which ultimately solidified our decision to acquire CoreSite at the end of 2021. We still believe this acquisition further positions us to take advantage of the emerging digital transformation enabled by 5G. Having now owned CoreSite for more than three quarters, we couldn't be happier with the performance we're seeing across the business and the use cases driving leasing activity, which we expect to serve as growth catalysts well into the future. Importantly, we're extremely encouraged by the consistently positive customer feedback on this acquisition. Customers continue to view CoreSite as a strong operator in hybrid IT solutions provider with a high-quality ecosystem, which under the American Tower umbrella can now provide more predictable scalability and future incremental value through our combined platform capabilities and expertise. So far in 2022, CoreSite has achieved solid new business volumes, a reflection of the strong demand for the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem, where over 80% of revenues are derived by customers with a variety of interconnections to at least five different and independent customers. This strong demand demonstrates the differentiated value proposition and resiliency of these strategically located and well-integrated assets. We are pleased to see strong new business volumes from enterprises, prioritizing digital transformation to the implementation of hybrid IT solutions, leading the migrations from an on-premise data centers to co-location data centers in major metros. We are also encouraged to see accelerating demand from leading digital platform, seeking to extend compute functionality closer to their users to enable automation, collaboration and address latency-sensitive applications and early indicators supporting our edge evolution thesis. Critical to CoreSite's interconnection-rich ecosystem value proposition is its open cloud exchange platform or OCX. OCX provides CoreSite customers with quick scalability and represents an essential element, as we seek to expand the ecosystem to more distributed points of presence at the edge development. Today, through this automated Layer 2 Ethernet software-defined networking platform, we connect our customer communities within and between our US data centers, and we connect cloud providers to CoreSite's nationwide portfolio. We continue to invest in improving the platform's features and building out the functionality and reach to enable high-performance, hybrid architectures more quickly and securely and at a lower total cost of operation than alternative solutions. More recently, we launched Layer 3 enhanced network services, including virtual routing, cloud connect tiering to service providers and cloud-to-cloud connectivity to leading cloud providers. These enhanced functionalities simplify an enterprise's network hardware or management resources at a lower total cost of ownership. Through continued innovation over time, CoreSite\u2019s vision is to provide customers with single port access to their entire digital supply chain, which we will also expect to be leveraged and extended as the distributed interconnected edge ecosystem develops over time. While the distinctive characteristics of CoreSite's portfolio, including its enhanced capabilities accorded to its OCX platform, represent the critical attribute in advancing our edge strategy, we also see tremendous value in CoreSite's development pipeline. Coresite continues to execute on opportunities to redeploy their cash flow towards high-yielding development project. Customers require additional scale across our footprint. And consequently, over 20% of our data center development under construction is now pre-leased. We also recently announced the acquisition of a purpose-built data center in Southern Florida, MI2, which will be connected to our existing Miami facility, expanding and strengthening our Southeastern footprint, where we have also integrated our legacy data centers in Atlanta and Orlando into the CoreSite ecosystem. As we look further out, we expect workloads to become even more distributed and localized. Therefore, we see the importance of an interconnection hub like CoreSite, increasing as customers look to future-proof their digital businesses who secure, flexible and scalable solution, enabling agile interoperability as businesses shift to more customized hybrid multi-cloud IT environment and importantly, require an extended edge computing presence to support evolving low latency applications. In turn, the mobile edge is emerging as a critical area in the convergence of wireless and wireline network. Over the past year, these 5G deployments in the US have continued at a rapid pace, we've seen elevated emphasis from select wireless carriers with respect to their edge compute strategies and a forging a partnership with cloud and enterprise technology platform to better prepare for the network demands of the future. We see all of this as incremental data points in support of our vision for forthcoming demand of VA. In our view, much like the adoption of the shared tower model, this digital ecosystem over time will be most efficiently provisioned through a distributed neutral host, multi-tenant interconnected edge infrastructure model, reducing the capital intensity and total cost of ownership among MNOs, cloud, landline and enterprise players and critically, facilitating a seamless universal customer experience for end users. Our tower portfolio, coupled with our US data center business, represents a distributed portfolio of real estate with accessibility to robustly interconnected core network and native access to cloud on rent. We believe the combination of these platforms will be critical as data processing extends from the core to the edge. With that migration, more distributed and localized points of presence, along with transit costs and low latency considerations, will become essential over time, providing American Tower and CoreSite, the potential to win across multiple edge layers. To date, our team has identified over 1,000 sites within our existing US tower portfolio that we see as shovel-ready candidate for mobile edge deployment based on location, parcel footprint, land control and existing fiber and power access. Over the next several months, we plan to break ground on our first 1 megawatt edge facility and an owned tower site to build upon our understanding of market demand and customer requirements, design a blueprint that can be rolled out at scale as the edge ecosystem developed and demonstrate the differentiated value proposition at American Tower and CoreSite can offer potential customers. As always, any future development will go through our disciplined approach to evaluating the market opportunity and economic returns of edge deployments at scale, as well as an evaluation of the best way to finance future deployment, which could potentially include strategic partnerships, financial sponsors or both. In short, the strategic partnerships emerging between the MNOs and cloud service providers, the evolution of latency-driven edge leasing activity within our CoreSite portfolio and our interactions with the architects, the low latency networks of the future have only strengthened our conviction. The edge will represent a meaningful opportunity to drive incremental value to our assets over the long term. Although, this architecture will take time to develop, American Tower is positioning itself as a critical future provider and partner for cloud, MNO and enterprise customers, as wireless and wireline network convergence accelerates over time. In the meantime, we'll seek opportunities to advance our learnings, including through the development of an edge application integrator and our participation in various trials in edge industry form. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to understand emerging trends, network requirements and customer needs. All aimed at strengthening our option to win at the edge over the long term. In closing, demand for wireless connectivity continues to grow across the globe, where despite the dynamic challenges we've all navigated over the past several years, the need for reliable wireless and broadband access has been elevated in importance as a means to advance global economies and the populations they serve. With carriers aggressively deploying their valuable spectrum assets, we will begin to realize the true capabilities of 5G. And with that, we expect to see new innovations that will change the way we live for the next decade and beyond. Our effort to build scale across our global footprint of macro tower assets for over the past two decades, combined with our continuous focus on platform expansion and innovation has position American Tower to support our customers in meeting the continued acceleration in mobile data demand, while leading the way in the development of new infrastructure model that will be essential in meeting the needs of applications of the future and drive incremental value on our assets over time. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full year 2022 cost. Rod? Simon, having seen the trends from the carriers for many, many years. I mean, there's always volatility in their overall spend. It will largely be a function of device penetration and application development that will require the further densification that we believe in the \u2013 in their deployment as well. So it's not a kind of a one-for-one type of a \u2013 I think a relationship with our overall growth. And also keep in mind that with our agreements that we have in place, we have these broad comprehensive agreements which really locked in a lot of that revenue growth for us. And so 70%, 80% of our revenue growth, we have tremendous visibility into as a result of those master lease agreements. And I would expect the carriers, as I said, to be investing in their market that demand develops. And I would expect, given the benefits of 5G that each and every one of us are going to be using significantly more levels of spectrum, if you will, over time. So I said it's not a one-for-one. Our MLAs do give us that kind of visibility. And overtime, I would expect higher levels of CapEx being spent on 5G, just as we saw being 4G versus 3G. You bet. Yeah, Rod, why don't you start and take the first couple and then I'll take the third. And I guess, Dave, just regards to your last question on Europe and the opportunistic buyback program that Rod talked to. First of all, with regards to our Celsius asset base and integration, we're really very pleased with what we've experienced over the last year. I mean you've seen the growth rates and the success that we've had there and the relationship that we've actually built with Telefonica. So that's all gone incredibly well. With regards to further scaling, we do have a sizable build-to-suit program that we are in the midst of, and we see even more a build-to-suit opportunity coming forward, I think particularly in Germany. With regards to further M&A, we stepped away really just due to the sellers' expectations of value. There's just a significant delta between the bid and the ask at this time. Now over time, that may change. There's just a lot of volatility economically or obviously, you will know around the world. And so there's just a significant amount of space between the bid and the ask. And so we've really stepped away from those. We're always asked to participate in them. And so you always see in the media that American Tower is doing this or that but -- and I know you well know that we're incredibly disciplined in terms of how we look at valuation. And given the terms and conditions of some of these transactions as well as the expectations of -- from a pricing perspective, we just don't see the value creation in those opportunities at this time. As I said, maybe that will change over time. I would hope over the next 12, 18 months, you might see some change there. But right now, not. And so we're going to continue to not to focus off the organic growth, working with our customers in the region. Drop in our build-to-suit program, which has been an incredibly terrific way for us to be able to grow inorganically within the business. As Rod said, at some very attractive yields. And really support our customers in the market and enjoy the growth that way. Thanks, David. Hey, Rod, why don't you take the first one, and then I'll take the second. And Greg, with regards to M&A on the data center side, as we said all along, we are very focused on developing the US market. I mean CoreSite's got a terrific presence in the United States. And with our tower portfolio here in the United States, we want to be able to enjoy the benefits of the CoreSite activity, as I highlighted, and as Rod highlighted itself, but also really be able to bring together this overall notion that we have in terms of developing that edge capability that we'll be realizing out the sites themselves, at our tower sites themselves. And so when you're seeing all this, again, noise about buying data centers and things outside of the United States, that's not where we're looking. That's not where our focus is. And if you take a look at the capital that's being spent on the business because we do have a fair amount of development going on within the CoreSite, within the data center activity, it's largely driven just from the cash flow that the business is generating. So the $200 million to $300 million that that we're investing back into the data center business in terms of providing more capability going forward, not just in our OCX platform, but also in space itself is just being driven by the $300-plus million of AFFO that the business is generating itself. So US is our chessboard as we speak, relative to our data center activity. Thanks Greg. Michael, let me -- maybe I'll -- I can start with that, Rod. I mean that's kind of an open-ended question there. You have when you start to think about what's going on around the world. I think the backdrop here is still the technology, right? And the backdrop is still the demand for broadband wireless. We've seen it through several technology cycles, and that's really driving the ongoing capital that all of our customers are looking to commit over the next several years. And so that provides, I think, a real stable platform for growth. And as Rod kind of went through all the numbers, we're seeing that, right? And we're seeing 5G being deployed in more and more markets. We've seen the growth rates accelerate here in the United States. We expect that to continue into 2023. You've seen the strong growth coming from many of our other markets as well, particularly in Europe and Africa, really a lot of significant activity going on in the market.  You've also seen our customers aligning themselves more closely with us. These longer-term strategic master lease agreements that we put in place, the one that we've talked about with Verizon, the other one that we've talked about with Airtel. I mean these are long-term contracts with well-capitalized companies. There are still spot of churn that we have going on in the market. A lot of activity in Latin America with some consolidation, particularly in Brazil and Mexico that Rod kind of walked through. And so we'll see a heightened level of churn in Latin America over the next 12 months to 18 months. We've seen some consolidation going on in Africa. But then again, we've been able to really largely work through all of that churn and still sizably increase the growth in each one of those markets. So I don't see any seismic shifts, if you will, over the next 12 months to 18 months. Yeah, we are in a rising interest rate environment. We're in an inflationary time around the world. The good news is that, we have long-term contracts and those very high inflationary markets. We've got escalators based on CPI and inflation in those areas. The other element, I think, within our business is we're well diversified. And so while we're perhaps taking a market that might be growing slower in another market, we'll be increasing the growth. And so it's offsetting some of the shortfall that you might see in other markets. I mean, we've talked about this in the past. It our carriers invest kind of like a sine wave, right? I mean, it's heavy investment and then they \u2013 it's less investment as they're tuning their network and then it's a higher investment. We continue to see that. We've seen that through 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and we'll see that through 5G. Our customers aren't going to be building the networks before they see the demand. And so that's going to be a function of device penetration is going to be a sign of application development. I mean, I talked about the two phases. You well know this, in terms of network deployment, first getting the coverage and then we're going to see further densification and sales splitting as their customers are utilizing the network. And with higher band spectrum, we're going to see an even increased level of densification just because of the propagation characteristics of the bands. So I do think that kind of a long rambling answer for you, perhaps. But I mean, the core is the underlying technology and the desire for our customers and their countries themselves and their citizens to really be able to significantly increase their overall usage in wireless data. And so as a result, that provides, I think, a real kind of protection for us particularly when we're looking at these long-term agreements. Hopefully, that answers your question. Hey, Ric. Good morning. Well, yes, I mean, Ric, absolutely. And as I mentioned with Simon, given kind of the MLA structure we have in place, it's kind of irrelevant in terms of that capital spend from our perspective, right? I mean because we already have the kind of the rates and the pricing kind of locked in for a long-term period. Now having said that, when I back up, I also believe that, that capital is going to be spent over time. And that could be a timing issue as well. It's all a function of customer demand and application development and device penetration. And so when you have those all locked in, you're going to see our customers physically spending on their networks because they have to. They're not going to want to see any decline in quality of service. And so they're going to want to meet this demand and stay ahead of the curve as they traditionally have. And so -- but from an AMP perspective, you're exactly right, timing is not that relevant to us just because of the construct of the agreements that we have in place. No, we haven't. We have not. Well, I mean, from our standpoint, and then I'll let kind of Rod step in here. We continue to look at the opportunities to delever as well as to look at supporting our equity. And given the movements candidly in the equity I think that there's some opportunities there to be able to generate some value. And so it will be a balance between the two. We talked about M&A and M&A kind of given the delta between the bid may ask kind of around the world. I think that's less focus, candidly, at this point in time. And so we'll look at our NAV and we'll look at it versus our share price. And well, as we always have, look at the kind of the most attractive ways of being able to drive AFFO per share. Thanks. Rob, do you want to cover the MI question and I can talk more broadly? And Matt, on the second question, relative to the impact of what's going on around the world, on our customers outside of the United States. Interestingly enough, we haven't seen anything of significance that would give me the sense that they're going to be slowing down on their build programs around the world. Now who knows what that might look like going into 2023 and 2024. But they have the same level of energy that we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months. Now we are also protected just because of the diversification of markets and diversification of customers. And so as a result of that, we are actually able to avert a particular issue in one area or another. And also keep in mind, as I mentioned in my remarks that our customers have spent almost $160 billion on spectrum. And so they don't -- they want to monetize that $160 billion and be able to get out into the market as fast as they possibly can. So we are seeing, as I said, the continued robust deployment of capital in the markets. And we continue to support them. And we see also -- again, a lot of build to suit activity in the market as well, which is also an indication of their willingness and ability to spend. You bet. Rod, why don't you take those two? Thanks, Richard."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning. Thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our international business. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q2 2022 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; including the closing of our Stonepeak minority investment in our U.S. data center business, our expectations regarding the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks Adam. And good morning everyone. In line with our historical practice for our second quarter earnings call, my comments today will be focused on American Towers international business, before diving into the trends that we see driving a long runway of growth in our international segment, I'd like to take a moment to review the principles that have underpinned our international expansion strategy over the last two decades. Since we first started expanding outside of the United States, entering Mexico and Brazil in 1999, and 2000, respectively, we've been guided by the belief that the secular demand trends and fundamentals of the tower business model that would drive tremendous value in the U.S. over a multi decade period would be replicated internationally. Central to this thesis was that the anticipated proliferation of wireless networks and resulting rapid growth and mobile data demand would necessitate neutral host shared wireless infrastructure across the globe. We also believe that by leveraging our core capabilities developed here in the United States, we could position American Tower as a premier global provider of communications, real estate, and a prime beneficiary of these trends. Further given the relative lack of fixed line infrastructure, accelerating population growth, and earlier stages of network technology evolution in many parts of the world, we believe we could both augment and extend our overall consolidated growth trajectory. So we set out to construct a geographically diverse platform of communication assets in the world's largest democratic economies, while establishing relationships with the leading global wireless carriers, achieved primarily through the acquisition of high quality portfolios with compelling underlying organic growth and risk adjusted return profiles. We then sought to leverage our scale, customer relationships and capabilities to execute on high return new build opportunities, and innovative solutions like power as a service that have strengthened our competitive positioning, and supported our customers in meeting their network needs, all while driving, increasing shareholder value. As a result of these efforts today, our global platform includes an international portfolio that fits in over 170,000 sites and contributes approximately 45% of our property revenues and approximately 36% of our property segment operating profit. Focusing in our international new build program for a moment, we've constructed approximately 40,000 sites since launching our international operations over two decades ago, just over 22,000 of those sites being built since the start of 2018 alone. We credit this recent acceleration to our enhanced market positioning ahead of major network deployments, demonstrated operational capabilities and strong cross national MNO partnerships, all afforded to previous strategic M&A expansion initiatives. In total, these 40,000 American Tower build sites are driving an attractive NOI yield of 25% owing to the strong demand we've seen for our infrastructure, and the operating leverage inherent to the shared tower model across the globe. As sites looking forward we\u2019ll continue driving toward our ambition to add another 40,000 sites to 50,000 sites to our international portfolio over the next several years. With that, let's take a few minutes to discuss each of our international regions and the key trends developing across our footprint. First, I'll touch on Europe; we have a portfolio of over 30,000 sites, and strong scaled positions in Germany and Spain, which are benefiting from many of the same trends driving strong growth in the United States, including the early stage of 5G rollouts, and a new entrant. As many of you know, we've taken a consistently measured approach to achieving scale on the continent. We started through a modest acquisition in Germany in 2012. We then spent the better part of the following decade evaluating various opportunities, who are disciplined approach to capital allocation, which led to our entry into France in 2017, and later a small scale entry to Poland. However, it wasn't until the Telxius transaction in 2021, that we found an opportunity to add significant scale to a portfolio that met the standards of our global underwriting framework. These characteristics include high quality, strategically located assets that stand to benefit from continued network investments and attractive contractual terms and conditions, such as CPI based escalators, which act as a natural hedge against local inflation, along with a low churn profile, which taken together drive compelling risk adjusted returns for American Tower and our shareholders. From a timing perspective, we couldn't be happier with our acquisition of the Telxius tower portfolio, across Germany and Spain, we've seen several quarters of accelerating activity as carriers begin lighting up low and mid band spectrum with new 5G equipment, while continuing to invest to support growth data consumption on their existing 4G networks. At the same time, in Germany, new entrant 1&1 is rolling out a Greenfield 5G network and we believe our portfolio of nearly 15,000 sites, primarily located in urban centers across the country is in a strong position to support their network bill. Earlier this year, we signed a framework agreement with 1&1 through which we can provide value to the carrier while benefiting from incremental growth associated with the relationship for many years to come. As a result of these factors, we're seeing strong leasing activity on our assets, as well as demand for new builds, particularly in white and gray spot areas where carriers are working to meet coverage requirements and provide critical connectivity in areas that hadn't historically been underserved. In 2022, we plan to double our previous record and build approximately 400 sites across Europe. And we expect this trend of elevated new build activities continue. Thanks to the demand driven by such initiatives, the pipeline secure through the Telxius transaction in our position as a leading independent power operator on the continent, with a global reputation for operational excellence. With that let's turn to our regions that are in relatively earlier stages of network technology, and where we see an opportunity to capitalize on a strong persistent demand environment for an extended period. There's probably no region where the benefits of local scale and the operational expertise gained is a premier independent operator are more pronounced than an Africa, where we're seeing these benefits play out across essentially every facet of the business. In recent years, we've seen the proliferation of affordable smart devices and consumer uptake of mobile application use cases drive outsize growth in mobile data usage. And our multinational carrier customers across the region have been working to rollout and enhance their 4G networks in response. For ATC Africa, this has resulted in average organic kind of billings growth in the high single digit range over the last several years, coupled with five consecutive years of record new build activity. This trend has continued unabated into 2022. And as a result, we've built over 1000 sites across Africa in the first half alone, up over 30%, compared to the first half of 2021, and nearly double the volumes achieved in the same period in 2020. These sites continue to demonstrate very attractive average day one NOI yields with our year-to-date builds producing more than 13%. And we expect to continue to execute on opportunities to add critical scale and earn strong returns in key markets throughout the region over the next several years. While the trends supporting a strong growth environment in the region are expected to persist, there are operational challenges to create unique opportunities in the African market, particularly in the context of a global supply chain disruptions, power grid availability and reliability and on-going macro volatility. It's here that the scale of our African business shared learnings of a global organization and an entrenched culture of innovation have resulted in a resilient, differentiated business across the region. For example, we've been able to leverage global supply chain learnings from the peak of the pandemic, as well as the resources afforded by our investment grade balance sheet and strong international cash flows to produce materials for a new build program several quarters in advance. Not only does this result in cost savings in an inflationary environment, but also derisk operational challenges in a core sector of high yield growth for American Tower, while bolstering our reputation as a preferred partner, who is capable of delivering new sites when we say we're going to. This forward thinking approach to the procurement of critical resources is also been applied to an area of our Africa business that we are perhaps most proud of our power program, where we've accelerated our innovative efforts across the region in recent years. Today, we've deployed roughly $300 million in the region to equip nearly 16,000 sites with the capability to source power from renewables, and more energy efficient resources, including lithium ion batteries, and solar arrays, and in our new build program, where we're working toward making the majority of our newly constructed towers operationally zero, or near zero greenhouse gas emission sites. In fact, as of the end of the second quarter, we've installed lithium ion batteries and solar panels at nearly 70% in over 40% of our sites in the region respectively, which has driven a reduction in our reliance on fossil fuel power generators, accommodated our potential to increasingly rely on intermittent renewable sources, and supported our progress toward meeting our GHG emission reduction targets. More recently, we've been able to leverage our position in the region to form a strategic partnership with a vendor in our energy supply chain. This alliance brings product assembly to the region, as we look to augment our delivery of environmentally and economically sustainable power solutions that are sites where power availability and access to efficient and reliable sources can often be a challenge. Additionally, this local partnership will facilitate the acceleration of our progress toward meeting our emission targets, reducing our supply chain risks, lowering the overall carbon footprint and cost of our procurement process and supporting the local economy and the communities we serve, which we are particularly proud of. Let's turn to Latin America, which was our first region of international expansion, and where we've seen upper single digit average organic tenant billings growth over the last several years. On a consolidated basis our nearly 49,000 sites earning a double digit NOI yield in our earlier vintage in the region, which consists of assets built or acquired prior to 2010 were seeing a U.S. dollar yield of over 40%. Today, M&O's in the region are in advanced stages of 4G, and in the early innings of 5G network deployments to driving a significant need for additional cell sites. As a result, we continue to see solid activity on our existing sites, as well as growth through new infrastructure to improve both coverage and capacity. Although we expect to see the on-going effects of industry restructuring impact net organic growth in the midterm, we believe the portfolio we've developed across the continent over the last two decades will be critical for our customers as they continue to invest in their networks. Looking at Brazil, specifically our largest market in the region in terms of site count revenue, we're seeing the final stages of a consolidation process that has resulted in a Transfer Network assets in the hands of large multinational operators, with the capabilities and financial firepower to build out enhanced next generation networks on a nationwide basis. Further with 5G auction now complete, our local scale positions American Tower as a strategic partner to our customers as they transform their networks, while allowing us to maximize the opportunities provided by consolidation, and increased carrier investment obligations. Although we're at the very early stages of a network upgrade investment cycle, we're already seeing incremental demand for infrastructure capturing a large share of the initial urban amendment cycle. We expect this amendment cycle to be followed by a period of new site deployments, aimed at improving capacity and performance, similar to the cadence we anticipate in the U.S. over the course of the next decade, which would translate to solid growth for American Tower in the region over a multiyear period. Finally, let's turn to Asia Pacific. Our portfolio in the region predominantly consists of our scaled footprint across India, as well as our more recently established presence in the Philippines and Bangladesh, where we've leveraged our management site deployment expertise to prudently evaluate opportunities in the region to high yield build programs, resulting in over 400 sites being constructed across the two markets combined year-to-date. In India, we continue to be encouraged by the improvements in market structure, carrier health, and government reforms aimed at easing the near term financial burden of operators and ensuring a multiplayer competitive ecosystem, all of which is driving incrementally constructive trends across the communications infrastructure landscape. And with the carrier consolidation cycle, and associated elevated churn largely complete, a full year outlook includes an expectation for positive organic tenant billings growth in the region for the first time in several years. While challenges certainly remain in the market, and we could see some variability in growth from period to period, our optimism around the longer term opportunity presented in India remains. With an attractive backdrop of a growing population of over 1.4 billion people it's driving accelerated mobile data usage and a government is demonstrating a commitment to a digital transformation of the economy, we see a need for thousands of new cell sites to serve 4G, and eventually future 5G networks. We expect these catalysts to drive a period of sustained attractive, gross growth, as well as a continued acceleration of our new build program, where we're seeing low to mid double digit day one NOI yields on average, and taken together with a moderating churn environment, we remain optimistic that India and the Asia Pacific region can be a solid contributor toward achieving our longer term growth targets on a consolidated basis. In summary, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across our international footprint, with an acceleration in mobile data consumption, driving sustained customer investments on current and next generation networks globally. Over the past two decades, we followed a consistent and disciplined approach to market and asset selection demonstrated a consistent track record of operational excellence, and developed the scale presence and strong customer partnerships across a geographically diverse and globally distributed footprint, which we believe places this at a distinct competitive advantage in a 5G world and beyond. While we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further enhance our scale to the same discipline lens, we remained focused on leveraging our position and capabilities to drive incremental value across our served markets. We believe our well balanced international platform, combined with our highly complementary foundational U.S. business, provides American Tower with an unmatched global portfolio that's optimally positioned to benefit from multiple network technology evolutions, and digital transformation opportunities for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to take you through our latest quarterly results, and updated outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we delivered another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before walking through the details of our Q2 results and revised outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter along with the financing initiatives we've executed over the last several months. First, we've announced and partially closed our plans to raise approximately $4.8 billion in equity financing in support of our core site acquisition, beginning with our common equity issuance in early June, and later, through our announced agreement was Stonepeak in our U.S. data center business. With these two transactions, not only have we addressed our equity financing requirements for CoreSite, but we've accomplished it in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and supports our investment grade credit ratings further through our partnership with Stonepeak, who brings tremendous expertise and communications infrastructure, and if they like minded long term investment philosophy, we've created a platform to further evaluate and finance growth opportunities across our U.S. datacenter business as the 5G ecosystem further develops. Moreover, we believe Stonepeak\u2019s investment represents a full valuation relative to what we have invested in our U.S. data center portfolio today, and allows American Tower to retain operational control, as well as the flexibility to execute on our mobile edge strategy. I'll discuss this transaction in more detail later. Second, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet by leveraging the debt capital markets, raising $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at attractive terms. As a result of our Q2 financing activities in pro forma for our private capital proceeds, which we expect to use to pay down short term floating rate debt, we will increase our percentage of fixed debt to nearly 80%, up from 66% as of the end of Q1, and bring pro forma net leverage down to approximately 5.5 times. With our CoreSite financing now largely complete, we remain committed to organically delivering back below five times over the next couple of years. Third, we see strong secular trends driving increased network coverage and densification initiatives among our customers, continuing to translate into solid gross new business globally, including the need for more cell sites internationally as Tom just highlighted. Evidenced by the success of our new builds program, we constructed over 1500 sites in Q2, representing the 12 quarter of over 1000 new builds since the start of 2019, a demonstration of the success of our capabilities and expertise, scaled to market positions, and strong customer relationships. Additionally, demand remains robust for our differentiated interconnection rich U.S. data center campuses, as customers leverage the dynamically scalable solutions and interoperability provided by CoreSite\u2019s national ecosystem, leading to another strong quarter of new and expansion leasing. And finally, our first half performance and confidence in our full year outlook and long term targets amid heightened market volatility, rising inflation and operational challenges is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the stability of the earnings we consistently generate. This is made possible through operational excellence and service dependability, our investment grade balance sheet, the strength of our underlying contracts, including international revenue supported by CPI linked escalators, the ability to pass through a substantial portion of our direct costs across our international regions, and the matching of escalator terms in the U.S. between customer and land leases, and more importantly, the mobile data trends driving unabated demand for our communications assets. With that, please turn to slide six and I'll review our Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our Q2 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by over 17% and nearly 19% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period. In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue was roughly flat due to the continued effects of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 19% or nearly 23%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and includes about 12% contributed by the Telxius assets. In addition, our U.S. data center business contributed nearly $190 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates are indicative of the strong secular demand drivers that underpin growth on our communications infrastructure assets across the globe as 4G and 5G deployments continue. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, as expected, organic growth was slightly negative at 0.4% including a sequential step down and gross organic new business on $1 basis associated with the timing of certain MLA use V commencements in 2021 which we guided to during our Q1 call, we continue to expect a reacceleration and gross new business in the back half of the year. Escalators were 2.8%, which as we also highlighted last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impacts of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwind year-over-year. On the international side, organic growth was 7.8%. Starting with Europe we saw growth of 11.2%, which remains elevated given contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which were only partially included in our Q2 2021 base. Absent Telxius our legacy European business grew roughly 6% and expansion of approximately 160 basis points as compared to our Q2 2021 growth rates. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 9%, which includes 8% in gross organic new business contributions, our highest quarter on record the continued strength and new leasing activity in the region was complemented by the construction of just over 400 sites in the quarter. As we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth in returns across the region. Moving to Latin America, organic growth was 8.3%, which includes approximately 8.7% from escalations. Consistent gross organic leasing growth was offset by expected elevated churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements, as highlighted on previous earnings calls. For both Africa and Latin America as we look to the second half of the year, we expect a step down relative to the first half in net organic growth rates due to anticipated consolidation driven churn, which remains consistent with our prior outlook assumptions. In APAC, we saw organic growth of 3.9% in line with our expectations and representing our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with nearly 1000 sites constructed during the quarter. It's important to note that although we remain encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing in our APAC growth rates, we do anticipate a modest sequential step down in Q3 to the low single digit range before recovery in Q4 to near that upper end of our 2% to 3% full year guide, which remains unchanged. Turning to slide seven, our second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew just over 13% or over 14% on an FX neutral basis to approximately $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.5%, down 170 basis points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced sprint churn along with higher pasture revenue, resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 7% and 5%, respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by sprint churn and the timing of cash taxes, which together provided a negative headwind of nearly 7%. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high level drivers. First, our core operating performance remains strong across our business, allowing us to raise our AFFO per share guidance for the year and increase our expectations on an FX neutral basis for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in Outlook to Outlook headwinds of approximately 100 million, nearly 50 million, 40 million and roughly $0.08 for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and AFFO per share, respectively. Finally, we have updated our CoreSite financing assumptions to reflect our completed common equity issuance, and our anticipated close of private capital funding. This update has resulted in a reduction in our total equity requirement balanced with the incremental debt and associated interest costs. Additionally, we have contemplated the minority interest impacts related to the Stonepeak partnership and updated closing assumptions, all of which I will address in more detail in a moment. With that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on slide eight, we are continuing to project consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint. The $15 million decrease relative to prior guidance is driven by the FX headwinds I previously mentioned, which were partially offset by over $40 million in core property revenue outperformance taking the benefits of CPI in our international escalators and accelerated decommissioning related settlements, together with upside in our U.S. and Canada in data center segments and over $40 million and other outperformance primarily driven by higher international passer revenue due to elevated fuel costs. Moving to slide nine, you will see our organic tenant billings growth projections, which have been slightly revised since our last earnings call. While our expectations remain consistent in the U.S. and Canada, international, and on a consolidated basis, we have made some adjustments within our specific international segments. In Europe, we have adjusted our growth back to approximately 9% reflecting our expectations for temporary shift and new business commencement timing, from the back half of 2022 into 2023. Demand remains very solid in the region, setting us up well as we exit 2022. You will also see that we have modestly raised the guidance for Latin America to approximately 7% in Africa to approximately 6.5% both up from previous expectations of greater than 6% reflecting a continuation of escalation benefits from CPI. Moving to slide 10, we are lowering our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million as compared to our prior outlook, driven again by negative FX impacts, with expected growth of approximately 10% year-over-year. While we are seeing a strong conversion of core property revenue upside to cash margin outperformance we have taken a revised view on SG&A, notably on bad debt reversal expectations for the year. Although collection trends were solid in Q2, we have pushed out some of our assumptions related to the incremental collections associated with previously reserve balances that we continue to expect to collect in time. Turning to slide 11, we are raising our attributable AFFO per share guidance to $9.74 from $9.72, despite absorbing the negative effects from FX and a continued rise in interest rates. To better understand the components in our revised outlook bridge, I'd like to spend a moment to walk through the moving pieces of the guidance associated with our updated Equity Plan and the mechanics of our Stonepeak partnership, which consists of 1.75 billion in common equity, and 750 million in mandatory convertible preferred equity for a total ownership interest of 29% on a fully convertible basis in our U.S. datacenter business. First, as I mentioned, we were able to reduce our total equity requirement from approximately $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion, including $2.3 billion of common equity proceeds, which meaningfully reduced our share issuance to approximately 9.2 million shares. The reduction in equity resulted in an increase to our debt balances, which together with the revised timing of the equity raise, along with the elevated interest rates has driven an increase to our interest expense outlook, which largely makes up the over $50 million other reduction to AFFO as compared to our prior outlook. Next, regarding our Stonepeak partnership, the financial impacts for their minority investment will appear in two places. First, a coupon of $750 million of mandatorily convertible preferred equity with a cost in the mid-single digit percent range will be recognized as a deduction to the AFFO generated by our data center segment and reflected in our consolidated AFFO, which represents approximately $14 million in our 2022 guide, as shown on the slide. Second, until conversion of their preferred equity, which is expected to occur four years from the date of closing, Stonepeaks initial common equity stake in our data center business will stand at 23% which contemplates approximately $2 billion of net debt on the U.S. data center business and will be considered as a minority interest deduction for attributable AFFO purposes, equating to approximately $20 million in our 2022 outlook. Please note, we have also reduced the European minority interest assumption from $160 million previously to $150 million largely due to FX. Together, we are now guiding to a minority interest adjustment of $170 million in 2022. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, our updated outlook also takes consideration updated equity closing assumptions. We previously assumed they made closing for our common equity issuance, which actually occurred in early June. We also assumed our private capital will close in mid Q3 with plan proceeds to be used to pay down short term floating rate debt. Taken all together, our revised CoreSite financing plan drove approximately $0.06 of incremental accretion relative to our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook, which includes a negative hit of roughly $0.03 driven by higher interest rates on our debt financing relative to our previous assumptions. Moving to slide 12, let's look at our capitol deployment expectations for 2022, which are updated compared to our prior outlook, while continuing to reflect our focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. First, we now expect to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion subject to board approval towards our 2022 dividends. This is down slightly from our previous guidance of $2.8 billion, which is simply a function of our reduced common equity issuance and continues to represent approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth on a per share basis. In regards to CapEx, we are decreasing our outlook midpoint by $60 million in total, with development CapEx increasing $15 million and with redevelopment capital and land acquisition spend decreasing $25 million and $50 million respectively. Our development plan continues to assume the construction of approximately 6500 new sites globally at attractive returns. In fact, on the nearly 3000 sites constructed in the first half of 2022, we saw a day one NOI yield of roughly 14%. Lastly, we continue to expect to direct roughly $300 million towards our U.S. data center business largely associated with development spend. Now turning to slide 13. In with our CoreSite financing plan largely complete, I will briefly touch on the strength of our investment grade balance sheet, which is fundamental to the execution of our stand and deliver strategy. Our long standing financial policies, including establishing optimal levels of leverage and an appropriate mix of debt instruments guide the management of our capital structure, which together with our strong business fundamentals provide American Tower with continued access to capital markets at attractive terms. As you recall, the American Tower proactively access the debt capital markets in 2021, taking advantage of historically low pricing, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes in the second half of the year, at a blended cost of approximately 1.6%. With our fixed debt percentage at the time rising to over 85%, this effectively allowed us to lock in low rate debt for future strategic initiatives including the CoreSite acquisition, which in turn reduce our dependency on the debt markets in 2022 as part of our final financing plan. We believe the strategic and efficient management of our balance sheet puts us in a strong position as we close out 2022 and look beyond. As of the end of the second quarter in pro forma for the close of the Stonepeak investment in our U.S. data center business our average cost of debt stands at about 2.6% with an average remaining tenor of over six years. Since 2010, we have reduced our average cost of debt by approximately 250 basis points and increased our average debt tenure [ph] by about one year by accessing the long part of the yield curve proactively refinancing our debt and capitalizing on low rate environments. In addition, and more recently, we also focused on diversifying and expanding our capital sources and structure by issuing Euro denominated debt, establishing our ATM program and efficiently executing on public equity raises and partnership agreements with leading global private investors. With a strong liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion on a pro forma basis, inclusive of Stonepeak proceeds and other financing activities subsequent to the quarter end in a staggered maturity profile we feel well positioned moving forward as we focus on organically deleveraging back to within our normal net leverage range over the next couple of years. Taken all together, we see the strength of our financial position as a competitive advantage for American Tower, whether executing on our growth strategy navigating economic downturns or volatility in the financial markets. And we remain focused on and committed to our thoughtfully established financial policies that have guided our financial strategy for the past decade. Finally, on slide 14, and in summary, Q2 was another solid quarter supported by leasing demand across our global portfolio of communication assets, strong execution of capital markets initiatives, including financing for the CoreSite acquisition and meaningful high yielding new asset development activity. Our high quality set of assets and established market positions continue to benefit from secular demand trends driving 4G and 5G initiatives across our global footprint, while the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, has us well positioned to manage and grow the business through potential market volatility and uncertainty. As we look to the back half of the year, we are excited about our growth trajectory and remain focused on executing on our strategic initiatives, which support our long term double digit AFFO growth aspirations. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] One moment here. We're going to Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Two topics, if I could, first on the U.S. curious if you can give a further update on the U.S. leasing environment, and specifically provide an update on how American Tower is tracking against the previously provided growth target of at least 5% organic growth beginning next year. And then also sorry, just one other part of this is just are you seeing any change in the environment with AT&T announcing the acceleration of C band deployment? And then I'll come back to be on in just a second topic on India if I could.\nTom Bartlett: Okay, Michael, I can start and Rod can join. We're right on track with our previously planned growth rates going forward. We would expect kind of an acceleration in the back half of 2022, and then even a further acceleration into 2023. So we have so much visibility with regards to our MLAs I think we're in a really good position to be able to track what that growth looks like. But everything is right on track, as we've laid out. And with regards to AT&T, nothing outside of the ordinary. I mean, all the carriers are building at a great pace. And as I said, very consistent with how we've seen the market and how we see it developing over the next several years.\nRod Smith: Yes. And Tom, maybe I'll just add in there. In terms of further discussing the on-track comment, we guided to approximately 2% of growth both on average for 2021 and 2022. And as you can see in numbers, Michael, right on track with that 2.2% last year in the U.S. So a little at 1% this year. That puts us right on the back of that 2%. I will remind you that there is a pretty significant headwind from the Sprint churn that is affecting the growth rate. And that does equal about 4% headwind going into this year. So that 1% would have been a lot closer to 5% if it hadn't been for [Technical Difficulty]. And then, the further guidance from 2023 out to 2027 is the -- is around 5% on a reported basis with about 2% adjusted for the Sprint churn kind of coming out of that. And we're well on track for that. We've got about two-thirds of that revenue growth already committed within the framework of our holistic agreement. And we're also seeing that in the co-location and amendment contributions from new biz in the U.S., so we are on track with that metric for this year. That is growth over last year. We do expect Q3 and Q4 to be at higher levels than what we had in Q1. So that's the acceleration we're seeing through this year, and we expect the levels as compared next year based on the way that our holistic deals are struck, the addition of DISH, as well as the acceleration of spend from the carrier.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And just one question on India. I was just cruising over the supplement on and on page 12 the historical power counts. It shows in the APAC region, presumably India that the -- that there's been this negative adjustment in sales or just shutdowns of towers that's been running at an annualized rate of 3% to 5%. And just curious, when this optimization could substantially slow down or conclude and if that then releases a headwind on the growth of this segment.\nTom Bartlett: Just quick on the \u2013 sorry Mike I had a little computer difficulty here that I just had to, to address. Yes. So when it comes to the, to the India information, it really is associated with the consolidation that we've seen in the Indian market with the turn that we've had over the last several years, as you're well aware of with that, when we have single tenant towers where we don't see additional lease possibilities in the near term, we did end up taking those down to kind of rationalize the operating expense aspect of kind of what we're what we're doing in India. So as you see churn in India continue to moderate which we've seen to a great extent, over the last couple of years, you'll see commission activity in the tower reduction slowdown as well. And there is usually a little lag between when you see the churn come through our revenue numbers. And then when you see the tower, some towers actually come out of the tower counts.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the data center portfolio. I think you referenced in the slides, outperformance there, it looked like the sequential numbers were good. What are you seeing in terms of bookings, trends, backlog, things like bad industry pricing. And then I think on the European guidance, you talked about pushing some activity from late 2022 into 2023. I think one of the other tower companies in Europe had mentioned something similar, can you just expand on that a little bit and what gives you confidence that it's just a matter of months and other things, given the kind of recession concerns and the impact power prices might be having there? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Hey Simon, maybe I'll take on the data center side. And we had another really strong quarter with all of our data center business. We've largely completed the integration of our legacy centered into intercourse, right. Strong sales, strong backlog, really positive cash MDM, churn is right on contract. So we're really pleased they're outpacing as Rod mentioned, we've actually upgraded our, our guidance relative to the activity that we've seen within CoreSite. So really strong top line growth, new and expanded sales activity, all very, very good mix with new logos with a network, new business, as well as with hyperscale. So really balanced, strong growth and interconnection, as well, which I think is just critical to this the competitive advantage that we are seeing in the business and fully expected. So couldn't be more pleased with, with what the business has been able to generate out of the gate.\nRod Smith: Yes, Simon. And I would just add to that, that's competence to undertake a couple of development projects on the data center side. So we have a few of them, two of them going on, that's driving slightly elevated CapEx investments in the data center business. So I think you've seen our numbers, we've got, upwards to 300 million, 320 million of CapEx, which is a little heavier than what we would normally expect to see. But we do have a couple of facilities where the demand goes strong, we've undertaken some additional development opportunities within the campus that that we operate. And then to, to address your question on Europe, we are seeing a little bit of a moderation in terms of the growth in Europe, our previous guidance was to have organic tenant billing growth for the full year to be greater than nine. And we've taken that back a touch to approximately 9%. And that's primarily driven because we do you see some leasing activity that we expected in the second half of 2022, to be pushed into 2023. So we do see a very strong market in Europe, particularly in Germany, with the addition of one on one coming in and the 5G, the initial deployment of 5G networks. And the way that the organic tenant billings Brookfield exit this year is going to be you know approaching 7% sort of SP exit run rate, which is I think is a really strong number for us. We couldn't be more happy with the timing of what we're seeing in Europe and the demand for our assets. Through the Telxius portfolio, we've picked up a lot of really urban centric assets, including a lot of roof tops, and we're finding that very desirable in terms of carrier activity going forward. And that's what's really driving the growth rates there. So it's really just the timing in Europe with the growth rates are really great.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And on the data center Tom, any updated thoughts on the edge opportunity now that you've owned it for six plus months?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, it's I mean, it's yes, there is. I mean, we've actually created internally an Edge Advisory Board, we're setting up an Edge Lab, we've scanned our sites, and we've done the really the full evaluation of, of our sites that can support a megawatt and two megawatts of activity. We're looking by the end of the year to actually establish and start to build out a few of these megawatt facilities. And we're in discussions, with all the potential participants looking to take advantage of the opportunity. So, it's still early days, as you recall that the reason for this particular transaction was the underlying business itself, diversification of our existing business into the broader digital infrastructure, industry, and then the potential for being a major player in terms of developing what that edge would look like. And so we'll have more about this on our third quarter call. We talk more about technology, Simon.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we go to the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great, thanks for taking the question. First, I wanted to touch on the -- you mentioned some of the churn in Latin America. And maybe you could just expand on that, whether that specific to the oil restructuring in Brazil, kind of how you expect that to flow versus some of the churn you've had in Mexico and how you see that trending into next year. And then, Rod curious on the bad debt reserve, you mentioned any color you can provide in terms of regions that you're closely monitoring in terms of collections or payments activity that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yes. Good morning, Eric. Thanks for joining. So the term that we're seeing Latin America is primarily just telephonic in Mexico is next thing in, in the Brazil market, we have begun to experience the oil churn. So oil has consolidated with [Technical difficulty] the contract that we have with oil actually has six years remaining on average across those, they're on about 7500 bytes or so, and already makes up about 1% of our growth. We've got quite a long time here to kind of work through the term, the oil, the oil restructuring that's happening there. So that's something that you'll see through the next several years, maybe longer than they were certainly with the countries who are picking up those assets, to talk about maybe restructuring those contracts, figuring out the term count. But we are in a pretty good position with oil, because we do have a silver stick over six years left on the contract there. And then in terms of the bad debt, in terms of where we're seeing the bad activity in, really in India and a little bit in Africa, recently here is we've actually reduced our reserves by about $8 million or so in Q2. And we have a plan in the Outlook to further reduce that, for a total of about $20 million. So flexions in Q2 were really quite strong for us around the globe, but particularly in India, where we're happy to see that and based on all the discussions that we have had, indeed to have with our customers, we expect elections in India will remain with those expectations that are in our outlook, which would allow us to the full year to rebuild about $20 [Ph] million of fire bad debt reserves. We did reduce that, you'll see it in the presentation by about 10 million. And that's just based on the timing of reversing some of those reserves that we have moderated. But it's still good news for the year.\nEric Luebchow: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And we can go now to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks, good morning everyone.\nTom Bartlett: Morning, Ric.\nRic Prentiss: A couple of questions. First, obviously, I think it's important you guys are focusing on attributable AFFO. Help us understand what a full year impact of the new Stonepeak would be as far as demand out convert $14 million in the current year and the $20 million minority interest? And then I've got two others quick ones.\nTom Bartlett: Yes, sure, Ric. So the way that we've got the guidance that next year, or actually in Q4 of this year, the full year kind of utilized run rate of approximately $200 million. $50 million of that has really come -- in the data center business that we have. So that's kind of the exit run rate. The balance, roughly the $150 million, is what we have in Europe. So that's kind of what you can think of from the minority interest piece of our AFFO going into next year. $200 million. $150 million in Europe and about $50 million on the data center side. And that's mandatory, you're going to see that through with deduct to our AFFO. The mandatory is about $750 million mid-single-digit interest rate. So you just calculate the math, and that's what you'll see in terms of the deducts from AFFO from that.\nRic Prentiss: Second one is, you guys obviously know I've really focused on removing amortization of prepaid rent from valuation and non-cash items. Interestingly, a number of smaller than crown, crown did put a table out there, talking about what they see, as far as the amortization of prepaid rent going forward, is that something you guys would consider and I\u2019ve got one of the quickie ones?\nTom Bartlett: I don't know, Ric, if we would put out a table. But I can tell you this year for the full year, we're looking at about $110 million or so in amortized revenue kind of coming through our numbers. That's down a little bit from last year. Last year, we were about $140 million. I think from a going forward run rate basis, if you think of that line item being around $25 million to $30 million on a quarterly basis. That's what we see. We think it will hold pretty consistent as we go forward. But you can think about our amortized revenue in line with the $25 million to $30 million per quarter, and it's going to be a $100 million this year.\nRic Prentiss: That makes sense, unless we lose, we're getting a lot of questions from investors on data center's. We talked about the growth capital opportunity, there that CoreSite. What do you think maintenance CapEx is in the data center business? And one I think unusual question we get that came up is what would cause data centers to become obsolete or individual data centers becoming obsolete?\nRod Smith: Yes, maybe I'll take the first one, Tom, and then you can handle the second one. So the maintenance CapEx is about 20 million this year, for us in our data center business. We could take the sense of round about 3%, maybe 4% of the data center revenue. We don't see that changing at all. So that's actually I think about the main FX of the business.\nTom Bartlett: And Ric relative to your second question. I mean, it all comes down to really barriers to entry. And if you think of the, the asset that we have with CoreSite, the barriers to entry are incredibly strong, with the interconnection capability with the cloud on ramps. And so, it's hard to think about a world in which, our customers are not going to be still looking at kind of this hybrid environment, to be able to connect with the cloud to be able to really use data centers as a sales channel for themselves as their interconnection within the business. So, we don't anticipate any of that kind of activity you said, but I must say that it's I think this particular asset that we have within CoreSite, and we're building out, really continues to build up those barriers to entry. And, and that's going to be critical. It's much like the tower business. We build up a strong barrier to entry with the foods and pieces of real estate we have, that's our strategy to find those assets, that have those strong barriers that we can continue to develop.\nRic Prentiss: That makes sense. Thanks, guys. I love hearing barriers to entry.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks Ric.\nOperator: Next we'll go to David Barton with Bank of America.\nDavid Barton: Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. First, I guess maybe, Rod, you in your script, when you were talking about the partnership with Stonepeak mentioned something to the effect that you were creating a platform for data center investment given Stonepeak\u2019s experience in the common infrastructure space? I think one of the concerns some people have about American Towers foray into data center\u2019s is that it's going to be a big call on Capitol at the margin, and we just don't know how big it's going to be. So if you could kind of clear up a little bit about how you think this platform, might be looking at acquisitions and investments and calls on capital. And then second, maybe, Tom, I don't know if you have a view on this. But with respect to American Tower, not having a holistic MLA with Verizon at this stage. Do you feel that that AMT contributing factor to AMPs kind of domestic same store sales growth performance this year might be that that Verizon is allocating business to its other tower partners in the early stages of its C-build and we need to wait for them to come around to become an A&T customer. Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Hey David. Let me take that one and then I'll let Rod and then I'll come back and add on to that to that to the first one. Relative to how Verizon is building out their seat, man, it's really hard to tell, in terms of whether it's happening with other carriers who have more holistic type of an MLA versus ourselves I don't think so, candidly. I think that Verizon is being very, as they always are measured in terms of how they're rolling out C-band. And I would expect candidly over the next half of the year, and clearly into 2023, some real investments that they're going to be making it to the site. We represent a significant piece of their portfolio, and strategically located in some critical markets, that I know Verizon is going to want to drop in C-band on the site they have to. And I would expect that to see in the second half. Relative to the timing in terms of us not having that it's really difficult to say whether there has been a timing difference in terms of when we're going to see that type of activity, as I said, I don't think so. But more importantly, I would expect to see significant activity really ramping up in the second half and into 2023, which is the more important element.\nRod Smith: Yes, and David, with regard to your question on the on the data center spend, this year we do have CapEx in the plan of about $300 million, maybe a touch over was a couple of development projects, that really will not be recurring in May. So we're looking at about $200 million of historical annual investment projects, and total CapEx including the maintenance CapEx. And that's where we expect to stay going forward, that would allow us to keep ahead of kind of a net absorption, forward looking two years, we need to make sure that each of our facilities has a scalable megawatt capacity. And in order to do that, we expect to reinvest about that $200 million, give or take, which is what CoreSite had been doing historically. Maybe ours will be a touch higher, maybe they were closer to 150, between 150 and 200, we'll probably be closer to 200, or maybe a touch, a touch over. So we're not looking to compete on a national scale and the data center business. We really bought CoreSite because of the cloud centric network, dense nature, the inner nature of these assets and kind of the geographical spread throughout the U.S. in really good proximity to our tower sites with his facilities. And in LA, and Silicon Valley, Chicago, Denver, Boston, New York, Northern Virginia, we have, we've got a nice spread of these assets. And because of the high quality nature, that's what's giving us the, the nice growth rates, as I mentioned earlier, up and up in the 10% range, which is well above our underwriting expectations of between 6% and 8%. So we see really strong demand for these high quality. And we're looking to really take these assets, and potentially in the future, connect them to our sales, cloud on ramps and interconnection facility at the tower sites, that's the real significant upside. So with that said, we'll be reinvesting the CoreSite cash flow kind of back into keep ahead of that two years of absorption on the megawatt capacity. And then you may see us add a data center here or there throughout the West, but not a major change in capital allocation certainly.\nDavid Barton: That's super helpful, guys. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we'll go to Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe to follow up on the prior one around expanding the platform, I guess, more broadly, beyond data centers just thinking about the broader common infrastructure portfolio, are you seeing incremental opportunities internationally, that may not have been as present a year ago. And then secondly, as it relates to India 4% organic growth. This quarter, we noticed a pretty big step down in churn. I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you could share there. And whether that's maybe this quarter is maybe a better run rate to think about, from a churn perspective in India on a go-forward basis? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Hey Matt. I'll take the first one, Rod can take the second one. We're very focused on the U.S. as we said. Yes, there are a lot of opportunities outside of the United States. And, and as a result of the positioning that we have with CoreSite, we get approached by many, many different players to develop, but we're very focused on the U.S. And as Rod said, to the extent that there's outside CapEx, we're going to be incredibly measured about how we spend that, but it will be at the tower sites. Remember the Edge is all about the opportunity at the site itself. And we've identified, largely over 1000 sites that with power and interconnection could support upwards of at least a megawatt of capacity. And so we're going to be looking at that where we can take it to a megawatt where we can take it to two, where we can take it to three. And to the extent that we're able to develop the demand from a customer perspective, we will look at building, that kind of capacity out, but it'd be very measured. It will be based upon demand. And it will largely be in the United States.\nRod Smith: And Matt, good morning, thanks for joining the call. So regarding India, we are guiding to 2% to 3% Organic candidate billings growth. In India for the second quarter, we did see a higher number than that close to 4%, which was nice to see. That was driven by consistent sort of stable organic new business, we have the 2% escalator, of course. And then we did see a reduction in churn and Q2 from Q1 and certainly a further reduction from the prior year quarter. So when we go forward, one thing that I will highlight is in Q3, we do see a higher level of churn happening in Q3 compared to Q2. So don't be surprised if you see that organic tenant billings getting pulled back a little bit from the 4% to probably below 2%, maybe approaching 1%. That will be temporary and you'll see it come back up in Q4 up in the 3% range. So I think for now, we are constantly optimistic about India. There are still some churn events that we're working through, and we feel good about a 2% to 3% number for this year. And certainly, as we go forward, we hope to see and expect to see continued moderation on the churn line, solid new business activity that allow us to grow from that 2% to 3% organic billings growth. But of course, we'll address that in next February when we give guidance for 2023.\nMatthew Niknam: That's great. Thank you both.\nOperator: And next we can go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Richard [ph] for Phil. Just wanted to follow up on the international tower builds of the 40,000 to 50,000 over the next few years. Wanted to get a sense of how much of that is contracted versus you have a good line of sight into\u2026\nRod Smith: Yes, I would say Richard we have a good line of sight into those. Certainly there are elements of that that are contracted, and the Telxius transaction that we did over in Europe, there are about 3000 sites that will build for Telefonica over time. There's also a building for Orange over time that are contracted. I don't want to put too firm numbers on there in terms of orange piece. When it comes to India, Africa and Latin America, it's more opportunistic. But we do have a really good run rate in terms of building sites. This year we'll build around 6500 towers, that's a little bit above where we were in the prior year. And we see that run rate is being sustainable going forward. And as of course, we highlight this often, those builds are some of our most attractive capital deployment opportunities. And we're seeing double digit NOI yields day one from those, those newly constructed sites around the globe. So we have a high level of confidence in that $40,000 to $50,000 number, some of its contracted, some of its more opportunistic but the pipeline is robust.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And the follow up on that the yields are high on day one, but what kind of colocation, I guess, expectations do you have on those builds over time? Can you give us any color around that?\nRod Smith: Yes, I think we would, we would view them to be very similar to the rest of our towers, in be comparable to the market that they're in. Certainly the towers we build, we like to see that they are, multiple entities, of course, and we know that the growth in mobile data consumption around the globe, continues to run at a at a really solid clip in that 30% range or even higher in some markets. So certainly getting additional tenants on those sites is something that's really important that we do have a line of sight to see that. And we see with these new builds, we do see in the north of 20% NOI yields on most of these, most of the assets. Time will tell, but given the demand for tower sites, the critical nature of these power assets globally, and the fact that a lot of these emerging markets, as well as Europe are positioned to new technologies, either building out 4G networks, or in the case of Europe transitioning out of 5G is there's a need in the demand for more and more tasks. So that gives us the confidence that we will be able to attract additional tenants on these site.\nUnidentified Analyst: And the last follow up for me on the data center side, just to clarify, there's no additional capital coming in from Stonepeak with either, the new builds, but there might be if there's an acquisition a small one or whatnot.\nRod Smith: Yes, I think that's right. The way and we announced a $2.5 billion investment which is gives them a minority stake that'll be when their preferred investment is fully burdened, there'll be a 29%, owner of the data center business. And certainly if there's any capital requirements needed to fund our data center business, there will be a capital call to all investors, us and veteran [Ph] on a pro rata share. And then certainly if there's M&A opportunities that require capital calls, of course, again, it'll be the same situation we'll be up and funding that, that together.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question. We've got to line up Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. In the U.S., can you provide a little bit more color on the activity you are seeing from DISH? And a question on capital allocation? You typically bring back sharp share buybacks after an issuance or ahead of like mandatory conversion. Going forward, can we expect it to balance maybe debt reduction versus opportunistic buybacks? Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Sure, I'll do the first one. On DISH, they're right where we thought they would be. I mean, they've been very measured in terms of their deployment. They've been very active. Got a couple of critical markets that they are bringing up. And we have a comprehensive MLA with him, and we're seeing good activity across the country.\nRod Smith: Yes. And then, relative to the capital allocation question, you've heard us say it many times, but the first priority, of course, is funding our dividend. And not only funding it, growing the dividend. So this year, we'll have a double-digit 12.5% growth rate on the dividend. And in the current environment that we're in, we certainly will be focused on delevering. It's no surprise to anyone on the call, I'm sure, that we are outside a little high of our target range of around 5x, below 5x. So we ended the quarter at about 5.8x. That's about 5.5x of the pro forma the investment from Stonepeak in. So we still have some delevering work to do, which we will be focused on. So we will be focused on organic growth, where we focused on driving 10% AFFO per share growth. We'll be focused on delevering. We'll be focused on our capex plans around the globe, funding the build to suits that can see very good returns on across all the markets that we're currently in. And then, to the extent that there are opportunities to buy back shares at attractive prices from time to time or fund additional M&A from time to time that's accretive and fits within our disciplined approach, we'll balance those to investment opportunities and make the choice that's best for our shareholders and drives the most AFFO per share growth.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And speaker\u2019s I hand the call back to you.\nAdam Smith: Thank you everyone for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to the investor relations team with any questions. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the call for today.

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we delivered another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before walking through the details of our Q2 results and revised outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter along with the financing initiatives we've executed over the last several months. First, we've announced and partially closed our plans to raise approximately $4.8 billion in equity financing in support of our core site acquisition, beginning with our common equity issuance in early June, and later, through our announced agreement was Stonepeak in our U.S. data center business. With these two transactions, not only have we addressed our equity financing requirements for CoreSite, but we've accomplished it in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and supports our investment grade credit ratings further through our partnership with Stonepeak, who brings tremendous expertise and communications infrastructure, and if they like minded long term investment philosophy, we've created a platform to further evaluate and finance growth opportunities across our U.S. datacenter business as the 5G ecosystem further develops. Moreover, we believe Stonepeak\u2019s investment represents a full valuation relative to what we have invested in our U.S. data center portfolio today, and allows American Tower to retain operational control, as well as the flexibility to execute on our mobile edge strategy. I'll discuss this transaction in more detail later. Second, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet by leveraging the debt capital markets, raising $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at attractive terms. As a result of our Q2 financing activities in pro forma for our private capital proceeds, which we expect to use to pay down short term floating rate debt, we will increase our percentage of fixed debt to nearly 80%, up from 66% as of the end of Q1, and bring pro forma net leverage down to approximately 5.5 times. With our CoreSite financing now largely complete, we remain committed to organically delivering back below five times over the next couple of years. Third, we see strong secular trends driving increased network coverage and densification initiatives among our customers, continuing to translate into solid gross new business globally, including the need for more cell sites internationally as Tom just highlighted. Evidenced by the success of our new builds program, we constructed over 1500 sites in Q2, representing the 12 quarter of over 1000 new builds since the start of 2019, a demonstration of the success of our capabilities and expertise, scaled to market positions, and strong customer relationships. Additionally, demand remains robust for our differentiated interconnection rich U.S. data center campuses, as customers leverage the dynamically scalable solutions and interoperability provided by CoreSite\u2019s national ecosystem, leading to another strong quarter of new and expansion leasing. And finally, our first half performance and confidence in our full year outlook and long term targets amid heightened market volatility, rising inflation and operational challenges is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the stability of the earnings we consistently generate. This is made possible through operational excellence and service dependability, our investment grade balance sheet, the strength of our underlying contracts, including international revenue supported by CPI linked escalators, the ability to pass through a substantial portion of our direct costs across our international regions, and the matching of escalator terms in the U.S. between customer and land leases, and more importantly, the mobile data trends driving unabated demand for our communications assets. With that, please turn to slide six and I'll review our Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our Q2 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by over 17% and nearly 19% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period. In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue was roughly flat due to the continued effects of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 19% or nearly 23%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and includes about 12% contributed by the Telxius assets. In addition, our U.S. data center business contributed nearly $190 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates are indicative of the strong secular demand drivers that underpin growth on our communications infrastructure assets across the globe as 4G and 5G deployments continue. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, as expected, organic growth was slightly negative at 0.4% including a sequential step down and gross organic new business on $1 basis associated with the timing of certain MLA use V commencements in 2021 which we guided to during our Q1 call, we continue to expect a reacceleration and gross new business in the back half of the year. Escalators were 2.8%, which as we also highlighted last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impacts of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwind year-over-year. On the international side, organic growth was 7.8%. Starting with Europe we saw growth of 11.2%, which remains elevated given contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which were only partially included in our Q2 2021 base. Absent Telxius our legacy European business grew roughly 6% and expansion of approximately 160 basis points as compared to our Q2 2021 growth rates. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 9%, which includes 8% in gross organic new business contributions, our highest quarter on record the continued strength and new leasing activity in the region was complemented by the construction of just over 400 sites in the quarter. As we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth in returns across the region. Moving to Latin America, organic growth was 8.3%, which includes approximately 8.7% from escalations. Consistent gross organic leasing growth was offset by expected elevated churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements, as highlighted on previous earnings calls. For both Africa and Latin America as we look to the second half of the year, we expect a step down relative to the first half in net organic growth rates due to anticipated consolidation driven churn, which remains consistent with our prior outlook assumptions. In APAC, we saw organic growth of 3.9% in line with our expectations and representing our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with nearly 1000 sites constructed during the quarter. It's important to note that although we remain encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing in our APAC growth rates, we do anticipate a modest sequential step down in Q3 to the low single digit range before recovery in Q4 to near that upper end of our 2% to 3% full year guide, which remains unchanged. Turning to slide seven, our second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew just over 13% or over 14% on an FX neutral basis to approximately $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.5%, down 170 basis points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced sprint churn along with higher pasture revenue, resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 7% and 5%, respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by sprint churn and the timing of cash taxes, which together provided a negative headwind of nearly 7%. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high level drivers. First, our core operating performance remains strong across our business, allowing us to raise our AFFO per share guidance for the year and increase our expectations on an FX neutral basis for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in Outlook to Outlook headwinds of approximately 100 million, nearly 50 million, 40 million and roughly $0.08 for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and AFFO per share, respectively. Finally, we have updated our CoreSite financing assumptions to reflect our completed common equity issuance, and our anticipated close of private capital funding. This update has resulted in a reduction in our total equity requirement balanced with the incremental debt and associated interest costs. Additionally, we have contemplated the minority interest impacts related to the Stonepeak partnership and updated closing assumptions, all of which I will address in more detail in a moment. With that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on slide eight, we are continuing to project consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint. The $15 million decrease relative to prior guidance is driven by the FX headwinds I previously mentioned, which were partially offset by over $40 million in core property revenue outperformance taking the benefits of CPI in our international escalators and accelerated decommissioning related settlements, together with upside in our U.S. and Canada in data center segments and over $40 million and other outperformance primarily driven by higher international passer revenue due to elevated fuel costs. Moving to slide nine, you will see our organic tenant billings growth projections, which have been slightly revised since our last earnings call. While our expectations remain consistent in the U.S. and Canada, international, and on a consolidated basis, we have made some adjustments within our specific international segments. In Europe, we have adjusted our growth back to approximately 9% reflecting our expectations for temporary shift and new business commencement timing, from the back half of 2022 into 2023. Demand remains very solid in the region, setting us up well as we exit 2022. You will also see that we have modestly raised the guidance for Latin America to approximately 7% in Africa to approximately 6.5% both up from previous expectations of greater than 6% reflecting a continuation of escalation benefits from CPI. Moving to slide 10, we are lowering our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million as compared to our prior outlook, driven again by negative FX impacts, with expected growth of approximately 10% year-over-year. While we are seeing a strong conversion of core property revenue upside to cash margin outperformance we have taken a revised view on SG&A, notably on bad debt reversal expectations for the year. Although collection trends were solid in Q2, we have pushed out some of our assumptions related to the incremental collections associated with previously reserve balances that we continue to expect to collect in time. Turning to slide 11, we are raising our attributable AFFO per share guidance to $9.74 from $9.72, despite absorbing the negative effects from FX and a continued rise in interest rates. To better understand the components in our revised outlook bridge, I'd like to spend a moment to walk through the moving pieces of the guidance associated with our updated Equity Plan and the mechanics of our Stonepeak partnership, which consists of 1.75 billion in common equity, and 750 million in mandatory convertible preferred equity for a total ownership interest of 29% on a fully convertible basis in our U.S. datacenter business. First, as I mentioned, we were able to reduce our total equity requirement from approximately $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion, including $2.3 billion of common equity proceeds, which meaningfully reduced our share issuance to approximately 9.2 million shares. The reduction in equity resulted in an increase to our debt balances, which together with the revised timing of the equity raise, along with the elevated interest rates has driven an increase to our interest expense outlook, which largely makes up the over $50 million other reduction to AFFO as compared to our prior outlook. Next, regarding our Stonepeak partnership, the financial impacts for their minority investment will appear in two places. First, a coupon of $750 million of mandatorily convertible preferred equity with a cost in the mid-single digit percent range will be recognized as a deduction to the AFFO generated by our data center segment and reflected in our consolidated AFFO, which represents approximately $14 million in our 2022 guide, as shown on the slide. Second, until conversion of their preferred equity, which is expected to occur four years from the date of closing, Stonepeaks initial common equity stake in our data center business will stand at 23% which contemplates approximately $2 billion of net debt on the U.S. data center business and will be considered as a minority interest deduction for attributable AFFO purposes, equating to approximately $20 million in our 2022 outlook. Please note, we have also reduced the European minority interest assumption from $160 million previously to $150 million largely due to FX. Together, we are now guiding to a minority interest adjustment of $170 million in 2022. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, our updated outlook also takes consideration updated equity closing assumptions. We previously assumed they made closing for our common equity issuance, which actually occurred in early June. We also assumed our private capital will close in mid Q3 with plan proceeds to be used to pay down short term floating rate debt. Taken all together, our revised CoreSite financing plan drove approximately $0.06 of incremental accretion relative to our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook, which includes a negative hit of roughly $0.03 driven by higher interest rates on our debt financing relative to our previous assumptions. Moving to slide 12, let's look at our capitol deployment expectations for 2022, which are updated compared to our prior outlook, while continuing to reflect our focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. First, we now expect to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion subject to board approval towards our 2022 dividends. This is down slightly from our previous guidance of $2.8 billion, which is simply a function of our reduced common equity issuance and continues to represent approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth on a per share basis. In regards to CapEx, we are decreasing our outlook midpoint by $60 million in total, with development CapEx increasing $15 million and with redevelopment capital and land acquisition spend decreasing $25 million and $50 million respectively. Our development plan continues to assume the construction of approximately 6500 new sites globally at attractive returns. In fact, on the nearly 3000 sites constructed in the first half of 2022, we saw a day one NOI yield of roughly 14%. Lastly, we continue to expect to direct roughly $300 million towards our U.S. data center business largely associated with development spend. Now turning to slide 13. In with our CoreSite financing plan largely complete, I will briefly touch on the strength of our investment grade balance sheet, which is fundamental to the execution of our stand and deliver strategy. Our long standing financial policies, including establishing optimal levels of leverage and an appropriate mix of debt instruments guide the management of our capital structure, which together with our strong business fundamentals provide American Tower with continued access to capital markets at attractive terms. As you recall, the American Tower proactively access the debt capital markets in 2021, taking advantage of historically low pricing, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes in the second half of the year, at a blended cost of approximately 1.6%. With our fixed debt percentage at the time rising to over 85%, this effectively allowed us to lock in low rate debt for future strategic initiatives including the CoreSite acquisition, which in turn reduce our dependency on the debt markets in 2022 as part of our final financing plan. We believe the strategic and efficient management of our balance sheet puts us in a strong position as we close out 2022 and look beyond. As of the end of the second quarter in pro forma for the close of the Stonepeak investment in our U.S. data center business our average cost of debt stands at about 2.6% with an average remaining tenor of over six years. Since 2010, we have reduced our average cost of debt by approximately 250 basis points and increased our average debt tenure [ph] by about one year by accessing the long part of the yield curve proactively refinancing our debt and capitalizing on low rate environments. In addition, and more recently, we also focused on diversifying and expanding our capital sources and structure by issuing Euro denominated debt, establishing our ATM program and efficiently executing on public equity raises and partnership agreements with leading global private investors. With a strong liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion on a pro forma basis, inclusive of Stonepeak proceeds and other financing activities subsequent to the quarter end in a staggered maturity profile we feel well positioned moving forward as we focus on organically deleveraging back to within our normal net leverage range over the next couple of years. Taken all together, we see the strength of our financial position as a competitive advantage for American Tower, whether executing on our growth strategy navigating economic downturns or volatility in the financial markets. And we remain focused on and committed to our thoughtfully established financial policies that have guided our financial strategy for the past decade. Finally, on slide 14, and in summary, Q2 was another solid quarter supported by leasing demand across our global portfolio of communication assets, strong execution of capital markets initiatives, including financing for the CoreSite acquisition and meaningful high yielding new asset development activity. Our high quality set of assets and established market positions continue to benefit from secular demand trends driving 4G and 5G initiatives across our global footprint, while the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, has us well positioned to manage and grow the business through potential market volatility and uncertainty. As we look to the back half of the year, we are excited about our growth trajectory and remain focused on executing on our strategic initiatives, which support our long term double digit AFFO growth aspirations. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. And Tom, maybe I'll just add in there. In terms of further discussing the on-track comment, we guided to approximately 2% of growth both on average for 2021 and 2022. And as you can see in numbers, Michael, right on track with that 2.2% last year in the U.S. So a little at 1% this year. That puts us right on the back of that 2%. I will remind you that there is a pretty significant headwind from the Sprint churn that is affecting the growth rate. And that does equal about 4% headwind going into this year. So that 1% would have been a lot closer to 5% if it hadn't been for [Technical Difficulty]. And then, the further guidance from 2023 out to 2027 is the -- is around 5% on a reported basis with about 2% adjusted for the Sprint churn kind of coming out of that. And we're well on track for that. We've got about two-thirds of that revenue growth already committed within the framework of our holistic agreement. And we're also seeing that in the co-location and amendment contributions from new biz in the U.S., so we are on track with that metric for this year. That is growth over last year. We do expect Q3 and Q4 to be at higher levels than what we had in Q1. So that's the acceleration we're seeing through this year, and we expect the levels as compared next year based on the way that our holistic deals are struck, the addition of DISH, as well as the acceleration of spend from the carrier. Yes, Simon. And I would just add to that, that's competence to undertake a couple of development projects on the data center side. So we have a few of them, two of them going on, that's driving slightly elevated CapEx investments in the data center business. So I think you've seen our numbers, we've got, upwards to 300 million, 320 million of CapEx, which is a little heavier than what we would normally expect to see. But we do have a couple of facilities where the demand goes strong, we've undertaken some additional development opportunities within the campus that that we operate. And then to, to address your question on Europe, we are seeing a little bit of a moderation in terms of the growth in Europe, our previous guidance was to have organic tenant billing growth for the full year to be greater than nine. And we've taken that back a touch to approximately 9%. And that's primarily driven because we do you see some leasing activity that we expected in the second half of 2022, to be pushed into 2023. So we do see a very strong market in Europe, particularly in Germany, with the addition of one on one coming in and the 5G, the initial deployment of 5G networks. And the way that the organic tenant billings Brookfield exit this year is going to be you know approaching 7% sort of SP exit run rate, which is I think is a really strong number for us. We couldn't be more happy with the timing of what we're seeing in Europe and the demand for our assets. Through the Telxius portfolio, we've picked up a lot of really urban centric assets, including a lot of roof tops, and we're finding that very desirable in terms of carrier activity going forward. And that's what's really driving the growth rates there. So it's really just the timing in Europe with the growth rates are really great. Yes. Good morning, Eric. Thanks for joining. So the term that we're seeing Latin America is primarily just telephonic in Mexico is next thing in, in the Brazil market, we have begun to experience the oil churn. So oil has consolidated with [Technical difficulty] the contract that we have with oil actually has six years remaining on average across those, they're on about 7500 bytes or so, and already makes up about 1% of our growth. We've got quite a long time here to kind of work through the term, the oil, the oil restructuring that's happening there. So that's something that you'll see through the next several years, maybe longer than they were certainly with the countries who are picking up those assets, to talk about maybe restructuring those contracts, figuring out the term count. But we are in a pretty good position with oil, because we do have a silver stick over six years left on the contract there. And then in terms of the bad debt, in terms of where we're seeing the bad activity in, really in India and a little bit in Africa, recently here is we've actually reduced our reserves by about $8 million or so in Q2. And we have a plan in the Outlook to further reduce that, for a total of about $20 million. So flexions in Q2 were really quite strong for us around the globe, but particularly in India, where we're happy to see that and based on all the discussions that we have had, indeed to have with our customers, we expect elections in India will remain with those expectations that are in our outlook, which would allow us to the full year to rebuild about $20 [Ph] million of fire bad debt reserves. We did reduce that, you'll see it in the presentation by about 10 million. And that's just based on the timing of reversing some of those reserves that we have moderated. But it's still good news for the year. Yes, maybe I'll take the first one, Tom, and then you can handle the second one. So the maintenance CapEx is about 20 million this year, for us in our data center business. We could take the sense of round about 3%, maybe 4% of the data center revenue. We don't see that changing at all. So that's actually I think about the main FX of the business. Yes, and David, with regard to your question on the on the data center spend, this year we do have CapEx in the plan of about $300 million, maybe a touch over was a couple of development projects, that really will not be recurring in May. So we're looking at about $200 million of historical annual investment projects, and total CapEx including the maintenance CapEx. And that's where we expect to stay going forward, that would allow us to keep ahead of kind of a net absorption, forward looking two years, we need to make sure that each of our facilities has a scalable megawatt capacity. And in order to do that, we expect to reinvest about that $200 million, give or take, which is what CoreSite had been doing historically. Maybe ours will be a touch higher, maybe they were closer to 150, between 150 and 200, we'll probably be closer to 200, or maybe a touch, a touch over. So we're not looking to compete on a national scale and the data center business. We really bought CoreSite because of the cloud centric network, dense nature, the inner nature of these assets and kind of the geographical spread throughout the U.S. in really good proximity to our tower sites with his facilities. And in LA, and Silicon Valley, Chicago, Denver, Boston, New York, Northern Virginia, we have, we've got a nice spread of these assets. And because of the high quality nature, that's what's giving us the, the nice growth rates, as I mentioned earlier, up and up in the 10% range, which is well above our underwriting expectations of between 6% and 8%. So we see really strong demand for these high quality. And we're looking to really take these assets, and potentially in the future, connect them to our sales, cloud on ramps and interconnection facility at the tower sites, that's the real significant upside. So with that said, we'll be reinvesting the CoreSite cash flow kind of back into keep ahead of that two years of absorption on the megawatt capacity. And then you may see us add a data center here or there throughout the West, but not a major change in capital allocation certainly. And Matt, good morning, thanks for joining the call. So regarding India, we are guiding to 2% to 3% Organic candidate billings growth. In India for the second quarter, we did see a higher number than that close to 4%, which was nice to see. That was driven by consistent sort of stable organic new business, we have the 2% escalator, of course. And then we did see a reduction in churn and Q2 from Q1 and certainly a further reduction from the prior year quarter. So when we go forward, one thing that I will highlight is in Q3, we do see a higher level of churn happening in Q3 compared to Q2. So don't be surprised if you see that organic tenant billings getting pulled back a little bit from the 4% to probably below 2%, maybe approaching 1%. That will be temporary and you'll see it come back up in Q4 up in the 3% range. So I think for now, we are constantly optimistic about India. There are still some churn events that we're working through, and we feel good about a 2% to 3% number for this year. And certainly, as we go forward, we hope to see and expect to see continued moderation on the churn line, solid new business activity that allow us to grow from that 2% to 3% organic billings growth. But of course, we'll address that in next February when we give guidance for 2023. Yes, I would say Richard we have a good line of sight into those. Certainly there are elements of that that are contracted, and the Telxius transaction that we did over in Europe, there are about 3000 sites that will build for Telefonica over time. There's also a building for Orange over time that are contracted. I don't want to put too firm numbers on there in terms of orange piece. When it comes to India, Africa and Latin America, it's more opportunistic. But we do have a really good run rate in terms of building sites. This year we'll build around 6500 towers, that's a little bit above where we were in the prior year. And we see that run rate is being sustainable going forward. And as of course, we highlight this often, those builds are some of our most attractive capital deployment opportunities. And we're seeing double digit NOI yields day one from those, those newly constructed sites around the globe. So we have a high level of confidence in that $40,000 to $50,000 number, some of its contracted, some of its more opportunistic but the pipeline is robust. Yes, I think we would, we would view them to be very similar to the rest of our towers, in be comparable to the market that they're in. Certainly the towers we build, we like to see that they are, multiple entities, of course, and we know that the growth in mobile data consumption around the globe, continues to run at a at a really solid clip in that 30% range or even higher in some markets. So certainly getting additional tenants on those sites is something that's really important that we do have a line of sight to see that. And we see with these new builds, we do see in the north of 20% NOI yields on most of these, most of the assets. Time will tell, but given the demand for tower sites, the critical nature of these power assets globally, and the fact that a lot of these emerging markets, as well as Europe are positioned to new technologies, either building out 4G networks, or in the case of Europe transitioning out of 5G is there's a need in the demand for more and more tasks. So that gives us the confidence that we will be able to attract additional tenants on these site. Yes, I think that's right. The way and we announced a $2.5 billion investment which is gives them a minority stake that'll be when their preferred investment is fully burdened, there'll be a 29%, owner of the data center business. And certainly if there's any capital requirements needed to fund our data center business, there will be a capital call to all investors, us and veteran [Ph] on a pro rata share. And then certainly if there's M&A opportunities that require capital calls, of course, again, it'll be the same situation we'll be up and funding that, that together. Yes. And then, relative to the capital allocation question, you've heard us say it many times, but the first priority, of course, is funding our dividend. And not only funding it, growing the dividend. So this year, we'll have a double-digit 12.5% growth rate on the dividend. And in the current environment that we're in, we certainly will be focused on delevering. It's no surprise to anyone on the call, I'm sure, that we are outside a little high of our target range of around 5x, below 5x. So we ended the quarter at about 5.8x. That's about 5.5x of the pro forma the investment from Stonepeak in. So we still have some delevering work to do, which we will be focused on. So we will be focused on organic growth, where we focused on driving 10% AFFO per share growth. We'll be focused on delevering. We'll be focused on our capex plans around the globe, funding the build to suits that can see very good returns on across all the markets that we're currently in. And then, to the extent that there are opportunities to buy back shares at attractive prices from time to time or fund additional M&A from time to time that's accretive and fits within our disciplined approach, we'll balance those to investment opportunities and make the choice that's best for our shareholders and drives the most AFFO per share growth."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks Adam. And good morning everyone. In line with our historical practice for our second quarter earnings call, my comments today will be focused on American Towers international business, before diving into the trends that we see driving a long runway of growth in our international segment, I'd like to take a moment to review the principles that have underpinned our international expansion strategy over the last two decades. Since we first started expanding outside of the United States, entering Mexico and Brazil in 1999, and 2000, respectively, we've been guided by the belief that the secular demand trends and fundamentals of the tower business model that would drive tremendous value in the U.S. over a multi decade period would be replicated internationally. Central to this thesis was that the anticipated proliferation of wireless networks and resulting rapid growth and mobile data demand would necessitate neutral host shared wireless infrastructure across the globe. We also believe that by leveraging our core capabilities developed here in the United States, we could position American Tower as a premier global provider of communications, real estate, and a prime beneficiary of these trends. Further given the relative lack of fixed line infrastructure, accelerating population growth, and earlier stages of network technology evolution in many parts of the world, we believe we could both augment and extend our overall consolidated growth trajectory. So we set out to construct a geographically diverse platform of communication assets in the world's largest democratic economies, while establishing relationships with the leading global wireless carriers, achieved primarily through the acquisition of high quality portfolios with compelling underlying organic growth and risk adjusted return profiles. We then sought to leverage our scale, customer relationships and capabilities to execute on high return new build opportunities, and innovative solutions like power as a service that have strengthened our competitive positioning, and supported our customers in meeting their network needs, all while driving, increasing shareholder value. As a result of these efforts today, our global platform includes an international portfolio that fits in over 170,000 sites and contributes approximately 45% of our property revenues and approximately 36% of our property segment operating profit. Focusing in our international new build program for a moment, we've constructed approximately 40,000 sites since launching our international operations over two decades ago, just over 22,000 of those sites being built since the start of 2018 alone. We credit this recent acceleration to our enhanced market positioning ahead of major network deployments, demonstrated operational capabilities and strong cross national MNO partnerships, all afforded to previous strategic M&A expansion initiatives. In total, these 40,000 American Tower build sites are driving an attractive NOI yield of 25% owing to the strong demand we've seen for our infrastructure, and the operating leverage inherent to the shared tower model across the globe. As sites looking forward we\u2019ll continue driving toward our ambition to add another 40,000 sites to 50,000 sites to our international portfolio over the next several years. With that, let's take a few minutes to discuss each of our international regions and the key trends developing across our footprint. First, I'll touch on Europe; we have a portfolio of over 30,000 sites, and strong scaled positions in Germany and Spain, which are benefiting from many of the same trends driving strong growth in the United States, including the early stage of 5G rollouts, and a new entrant. As many of you know, we've taken a consistently measured approach to achieving scale on the continent. We started through a modest acquisition in Germany in 2012. We then spent the better part of the following decade evaluating various opportunities, who are disciplined approach to capital allocation, which led to our entry into France in 2017, and later a small scale entry to Poland. However, it wasn't until the Telxius transaction in 2021, that we found an opportunity to add significant scale to a portfolio that met the standards of our global underwriting framework. These characteristics include high quality, strategically located assets that stand to benefit from continued network investments and attractive contractual terms and conditions, such as CPI based escalators, which act as a natural hedge against local inflation, along with a low churn profile, which taken together drive compelling risk adjusted returns for American Tower and our shareholders. From a timing perspective, we couldn't be happier with our acquisition of the Telxius tower portfolio, across Germany and Spain, we've seen several quarters of accelerating activity as carriers begin lighting up low and mid band spectrum with new 5G equipment, while continuing to invest to support growth data consumption on their existing 4G networks. At the same time, in Germany, new entrant 1&1 is rolling out a Greenfield 5G network and we believe our portfolio of nearly 15,000 sites, primarily located in urban centers across the country is in a strong position to support their network bill. Earlier this year, we signed a framework agreement with 1&1 through which we can provide value to the carrier while benefiting from incremental growth associated with the relationship for many years to come. As a result of these factors, we're seeing strong leasing activity on our assets, as well as demand for new builds, particularly in white and gray spot areas where carriers are working to meet coverage requirements and provide critical connectivity in areas that hadn't historically been underserved. In 2022, we plan to double our previous record and build approximately 400 sites across Europe. And we expect this trend of elevated new build activities continue. Thanks to the demand driven by such initiatives, the pipeline secure through the Telxius transaction in our position as a leading independent power operator on the continent, with a global reputation for operational excellence. With that let's turn to our regions that are in relatively earlier stages of network technology, and where we see an opportunity to capitalize on a strong persistent demand environment for an extended period. There's probably no region where the benefits of local scale and the operational expertise gained is a premier independent operator are more pronounced than an Africa, where we're seeing these benefits play out across essentially every facet of the business. In recent years, we've seen the proliferation of affordable smart devices and consumer uptake of mobile application use cases drive outsize growth in mobile data usage. And our multinational carrier customers across the region have been working to rollout and enhance their 4G networks in response. For ATC Africa, this has resulted in average organic kind of billings growth in the high single digit range over the last several years, coupled with five consecutive years of record new build activity. This trend has continued unabated into 2022. And as a result, we've built over 1000 sites across Africa in the first half alone, up over 30%, compared to the first half of 2021, and nearly double the volumes achieved in the same period in 2020. These sites continue to demonstrate very attractive average day one NOI yields with our year-to-date builds producing more than 13%. And we expect to continue to execute on opportunities to add critical scale and earn strong returns in key markets throughout the region over the next several years. While the trends supporting a strong growth environment in the region are expected to persist, there are operational challenges to create unique opportunities in the African market, particularly in the context of a global supply chain disruptions, power grid availability and reliability and on-going macro volatility. It's here that the scale of our African business shared learnings of a global organization and an entrenched culture of innovation have resulted in a resilient, differentiated business across the region. For example, we've been able to leverage global supply chain learnings from the peak of the pandemic, as well as the resources afforded by our investment grade balance sheet and strong international cash flows to produce materials for a new build program several quarters in advance. Not only does this result in cost savings in an inflationary environment, but also derisk operational challenges in a core sector of high yield growth for American Tower, while bolstering our reputation as a preferred partner, who is capable of delivering new sites when we say we're going to. This forward thinking approach to the procurement of critical resources is also been applied to an area of our Africa business that we are perhaps most proud of our power program, where we've accelerated our innovative efforts across the region in recent years. Today, we've deployed roughly $300 million in the region to equip nearly 16,000 sites with the capability to source power from renewables, and more energy efficient resources, including lithium ion batteries, and solar arrays, and in our new build program, where we're working toward making the majority of our newly constructed towers operationally zero, or near zero greenhouse gas emission sites. In fact, as of the end of the second quarter, we've installed lithium ion batteries and solar panels at nearly 70% in over 40% of our sites in the region respectively, which has driven a reduction in our reliance on fossil fuel power generators, accommodated our potential to increasingly rely on intermittent renewable sources, and supported our progress toward meeting our GHG emission reduction targets. More recently, we've been able to leverage our position in the region to form a strategic partnership with a vendor in our energy supply chain. This alliance brings product assembly to the region, as we look to augment our delivery of environmentally and economically sustainable power solutions that are sites where power availability and access to efficient and reliable sources can often be a challenge. Additionally, this local partnership will facilitate the acceleration of our progress toward meeting our emission targets, reducing our supply chain risks, lowering the overall carbon footprint and cost of our procurement process and supporting the local economy and the communities we serve, which we are particularly proud of. Let's turn to Latin America, which was our first region of international expansion, and where we've seen upper single digit average organic tenant billings growth over the last several years. On a consolidated basis our nearly 49,000 sites earning a double digit NOI yield in our earlier vintage in the region, which consists of assets built or acquired prior to 2010 were seeing a U.S. dollar yield of over 40%. Today, M&O's in the region are in advanced stages of 4G, and in the early innings of 5G network deployments to driving a significant need for additional cell sites. As a result, we continue to see solid activity on our existing sites, as well as growth through new infrastructure to improve both coverage and capacity. Although we expect to see the on-going effects of industry restructuring impact net organic growth in the midterm, we believe the portfolio we've developed across the continent over the last two decades will be critical for our customers as they continue to invest in their networks. Looking at Brazil, specifically our largest market in the region in terms of site count revenue, we're seeing the final stages of a consolidation process that has resulted in a Transfer Network assets in the hands of large multinational operators, with the capabilities and financial firepower to build out enhanced next generation networks on a nationwide basis. Further with 5G auction now complete, our local scale positions American Tower as a strategic partner to our customers as they transform their networks, while allowing us to maximize the opportunities provided by consolidation, and increased carrier investment obligations. Although we're at the very early stages of a network upgrade investment cycle, we're already seeing incremental demand for infrastructure capturing a large share of the initial urban amendment cycle. We expect this amendment cycle to be followed by a period of new site deployments, aimed at improving capacity and performance, similar to the cadence we anticipate in the U.S. over the course of the next decade, which would translate to solid growth for American Tower in the region over a multiyear period. Finally, let's turn to Asia Pacific. Our portfolio in the region predominantly consists of our scaled footprint across India, as well as our more recently established presence in the Philippines and Bangladesh, where we've leveraged our management site deployment expertise to prudently evaluate opportunities in the region to high yield build programs, resulting in over 400 sites being constructed across the two markets combined year-to-date. In India, we continue to be encouraged by the improvements in market structure, carrier health, and government reforms aimed at easing the near term financial burden of operators and ensuring a multiplayer competitive ecosystem, all of which is driving incrementally constructive trends across the communications infrastructure landscape. And with the carrier consolidation cycle, and associated elevated churn largely complete, a full year outlook includes an expectation for positive organic tenant billings growth in the region for the first time in several years. While challenges certainly remain in the market, and we could see some variability in growth from period to period, our optimism around the longer term opportunity presented in India remains. With an attractive backdrop of a growing population of over 1.4 billion people it's driving accelerated mobile data usage and a government is demonstrating a commitment to a digital transformation of the economy, we see a need for thousands of new cell sites to serve 4G, and eventually future 5G networks. We expect these catalysts to drive a period of sustained attractive, gross growth, as well as a continued acceleration of our new build program, where we're seeing low to mid double digit day one NOI yields on average, and taken together with a moderating churn environment, we remain optimistic that India and the Asia Pacific region can be a solid contributor toward achieving our longer term growth targets on a consolidated basis. In summary, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across our international footprint, with an acceleration in mobile data consumption, driving sustained customer investments on current and next generation networks globally. Over the past two decades, we followed a consistent and disciplined approach to market and asset selection demonstrated a consistent track record of operational excellence, and developed the scale presence and strong customer partnerships across a geographically diverse and globally distributed footprint, which we believe places this at a distinct competitive advantage in a 5G world and beyond. While we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further enhance our scale to the same discipline lens, we remained focused on leveraging our position and capabilities to drive incremental value across our served markets. We believe our well balanced international platform, combined with our highly complementary foundational U.S. business, provides American Tower with an unmatched global portfolio that's optimally positioned to benefit from multiple network technology evolutions, and digital transformation opportunities for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to take you through our latest quarterly results, and updated outlook. Rod? Okay, Michael, I can start and Rod can join. We're right on track with our previously planned growth rates going forward. We would expect kind of an acceleration in the back half of 2022, and then even a further acceleration into 2023. So we have so much visibility with regards to our MLAs I think we're in a really good position to be able to track what that growth looks like. But everything is right on track, as we've laid out. And with regards to AT&T, nothing outside of the ordinary. I mean, all the carriers are building at a great pace. And as I said, very consistent with how we've seen the market and how we see it developing over the next several years. Just quick on the \u2013 sorry Mike I had a little computer difficulty here that I just had to, to address. Yes. So when it comes to the, to the India information, it really is associated with the consolidation that we've seen in the Indian market with the turn that we've had over the last several years, as you're well aware of with that, when we have single tenant towers where we don't see additional lease possibilities in the near term, we did end up taking those down to kind of rationalize the operating expense aspect of kind of what we're what we're doing in India. So as you see churn in India continue to moderate which we've seen to a great extent, over the last couple of years, you'll see commission activity in the tower reduction slowdown as well. And there is usually a little lag between when you see the churn come through our revenue numbers. And then when you see the tower, some towers actually come out of the tower counts. Hey Simon, maybe I'll take on the data center side. And we had another really strong quarter with all of our data center business. We've largely completed the integration of our legacy centered into intercourse, right. Strong sales, strong backlog, really positive cash MDM, churn is right on contract. So we're really pleased they're outpacing as Rod mentioned, we've actually upgraded our, our guidance relative to the activity that we've seen within CoreSite. So really strong top line growth, new and expanded sales activity, all very, very good mix with new logos with a network, new business, as well as with hyperscale. So really balanced, strong growth and interconnection, as well, which I think is just critical to this the competitive advantage that we are seeing in the business and fully expected. So couldn't be more pleased with, with what the business has been able to generate out of the gate. Yes, it's I mean, it's yes, there is. I mean, we've actually created internally an Edge Advisory Board, we're setting up an Edge Lab, we've scanned our sites, and we've done the really the full evaluation of, of our sites that can support a megawatt and two megawatts of activity. We're looking by the end of the year to actually establish and start to build out a few of these megawatt facilities. And we're in discussions, with all the potential participants looking to take advantage of the opportunity. So, it's still early days, as you recall that the reason for this particular transaction was the underlying business itself, diversification of our existing business into the broader digital infrastructure, industry, and then the potential for being a major player in terms of developing what that edge would look like. And so we'll have more about this on our third quarter call. We talk more about technology, Simon. Morning, Ric. Yes, sure, Ric. So the way that we've got the guidance that next year, or actually in Q4 of this year, the full year kind of utilized run rate of approximately $200 million. $50 million of that has really come -- in the data center business that we have. So that's kind of the exit run rate. The balance, roughly the $150 million, is what we have in Europe. So that's kind of what you can think of from the minority interest piece of our AFFO going into next year. $200 million. $150 million in Europe and about $50 million on the data center side. And that's mandatory, you're going to see that through with deduct to our AFFO. The mandatory is about $750 million mid-single-digit interest rate. So you just calculate the math, and that's what you'll see in terms of the deducts from AFFO from that. I don't know, Ric, if we would put out a table. But I can tell you this year for the full year, we're looking at about $110 million or so in amortized revenue kind of coming through our numbers. That's down a little bit from last year. Last year, we were about $140 million. I think from a going forward run rate basis, if you think of that line item being around $25 million to $30 million on a quarterly basis. That's what we see. We think it will hold pretty consistent as we go forward. But you can think about our amortized revenue in line with the $25 million to $30 million per quarter, and it's going to be a $100 million this year. And Ric relative to your second question. I mean, it all comes down to really barriers to entry. And if you think of the, the asset that we have with CoreSite, the barriers to entry are incredibly strong, with the interconnection capability with the cloud on ramps. And so, it's hard to think about a world in which, our customers are not going to be still looking at kind of this hybrid environment, to be able to connect with the cloud to be able to really use data centers as a sales channel for themselves as their interconnection within the business. So, we don't anticipate any of that kind of activity you said, but I must say that it's I think this particular asset that we have within CoreSite, and we're building out, really continues to build up those barriers to entry. And, and that's going to be critical. It's much like the tower business. We build up a strong barrier to entry with the foods and pieces of real estate we have, that's our strategy to find those assets, that have those strong barriers that we can continue to develop. Thanks Ric. Hey David. Let me take that one and then I'll let Rod and then I'll come back and add on to that to that to the first one. Relative to how Verizon is building out their seat, man, it's really hard to tell, in terms of whether it's happening with other carriers who have more holistic type of an MLA versus ourselves I don't think so, candidly. I think that Verizon is being very, as they always are measured in terms of how they're rolling out C-band. And I would expect candidly over the next half of the year, and clearly into 2023, some real investments that they're going to be making it to the site. We represent a significant piece of their portfolio, and strategically located in some critical markets, that I know Verizon is going to want to drop in C-band on the site they have to. And I would expect that to see in the second half. Relative to the timing in terms of us not having that it's really difficult to say whether there has been a timing difference in terms of when we're going to see that type of activity, as I said, I don't think so. But more importantly, I would expect to see significant activity really ramping up in the second half and into 2023, which is the more important element. Hey Matt. I'll take the first one, Rod can take the second one. We're very focused on the U.S. as we said. Yes, there are a lot of opportunities outside of the United States. And, and as a result of the positioning that we have with CoreSite, we get approached by many, many different players to develop, but we're very focused on the U.S. And as Rod said, to the extent that there's outside CapEx, we're going to be incredibly measured about how we spend that, but it will be at the tower sites. Remember the Edge is all about the opportunity at the site itself. And we've identified, largely over 1000 sites that with power and interconnection could support upwards of at least a megawatt of capacity. And so we're going to be looking at that where we can take it to a megawatt where we can take it to two, where we can take it to three. And to the extent that we're able to develop the demand from a customer perspective, we will look at building, that kind of capacity out, but it'd be very measured. It will be based upon demand. And it will largely be in the United States. Sure, I'll do the first one. On DISH, they're right where we thought they would be. I mean, they've been very measured in terms of their deployment. They've been very active. Got a couple of critical markets that they are bringing up. And we have a comprehensive MLA with him, and we're seeing good activity across the country."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.  On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. business. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2022 results and revise full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.  You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Adam. And thank you everyone for joining our call this morning. In line with our traditional first quarter practice, my comments on this call will primarily focus on our core U.S. and Canadian tower business, which together with our U.S. based data center segment, made up approximately 54% of our total property revenues, and 65% of our total property segment operating profit in the first quarter.  Growth in our foundational U.S. and Canadian business continues to be propelled by the rapid acceleration in mobile data consumption that we've seen over the last decade plus. Back in 2017, the average smartphone in the U.S. was consuming roughly six gigabytes of data per month. And today, in the early stages of 5G uptake by consumers, that number has grown by a staggering 240% to over 20 gigabytes on a monthly basis.  As both 5G handsets and coverage become increasingly pervasive, this upward trend is expected to continue, with industry estimates now forecasting an average monthly consumption rate of 54 gigabytes by 2027. To meet this expected demand, carriers are aggressively deploying mid-band spectrum to provide ubiquitous 5G mobile services.  Historically, annual carrier CapEx in the U.S. has grown by approximately $5 billion to $6 billion, with every newG as MNOs deploy capital to maintain service quality on their increasingly strained networks, and provide incremental capacity and density to meet consumer demand for enhanced network performance.  Early evidence in the 5G cycle suggest this will continue to be the case. In fact, in 2021, we saw carriers increase aggregate network CapEx to approximately $34 billion up from the roughly $30 billion annually, we saw during the 4G cycle. And independent industry reports suggest that this number should continue in the $35 billion range on average going forward.  Further, as we've seen with prior network technology deployments, we expect a prolonged 5G investment cycle that will extend over the next decade. Today, carriers are in the earlier stages of upgrading sites with new equipment to provide broad contiguous 5G coverage across their respective subscriber basis. And given the propagation characteristics of mid-band spectrum, and ever increasing mobile data consumption paired with incremental low latency requirements arising from 5G enabled used cases, we would expect an extended period of investment aimed at delivering greater cell site density and stronger performance across networks for many years to come.  Importantly, it is clear that macro towers will continue to be crucial infrastructure for the long runway of carrier network investments that lie ahead. Macro sites have historically been the most cost effective means for carriers to provide broad base network coverage to the vast majority of the U.S. populace, and evidence suggests that remains unchanged in a 5G world.  To support this point over the last five years, our backlog of contractually guaranteed revenues in the U.S. is more than doubled on a per site basis. This speaks not only to our team's capacity to secure long-term, profitable cash flow growth from more than 43,000 distributed sites, but also to the long-term value our tenants place on our macro tower assets as a critical component of their network deployment strategy for 5G and beyond.  These trends along with the guaranteed growth secure through our comprehensive MLAs support our expectation for strong growth on our tower assets, both in the near and longer term. In 2022, we expect another year of accelerating gross new business growth in the U.S. and Canada. And as we've previously communicated, growth from colocations and amendments, is expected to ramp in the back half of the year with the expectation that we'll exit 2022 on a high point.  With colocation and amendment contributions accelerating and the impacts of the Sprint churn beginning to come off their peaks we are well positioned to execute on a return to strong mid-single digit organic tenant billings growth in 2023 and beyond.  On the operational front, our U.S. teams remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. That allow us to quickly scale up to meet customer needs and maximize the flow through of top-line growth to the bottom line. Over the last few years, we progressed on process and IT initiatives designed to deliver best-in-class cycle times and introduce technology innovations in the field that improves site monitoring and data collection capabilities, while lowering site level operating costs and providing efficiency benefits for our tenants.  In addition, our focus on cost controls has driven cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue in the segment to well below 4%, on a consistent basis, a trend we expect to continue in 2022 and beyond.  As a result, we've been able to continue extending on the significant operating leverage inherent to the tower business model. At the midpoint of our 2022 outlook, we expect an operating profit margin of 78.8%, representing a 370 basis point expansion in the segment over the last five years, even while absorbing the significant impacts of Sprint churn more recently.  This strong conversion of top line growth to profit margin, combined with the low capital intensity of just over 1% positions our U.S. and Canadian business to continue its decades long track record of delivering strong free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond.  With that, I'd like to shift gears for a moment to our data center segment, which we expect to benefit from many of the same long-term technological trends that are driving attractive growth in our tower business. We're off to a great start in our first full quarter of ownership of the CoreSite business. In Q1 is expected the CoreSite team delivered a very strong quarter of new and expansion sales, as these interconnection rich network and cloud dense data center campuses continue to attract strong demand from enterprises to cloud, the network and IT service providers in key U.S. markets.  Looking forward, we expect to continue to see accelerating Hybrid IT and multi-cloud deployments drive increasing demand for a highly interconnected portfolio, which should result in opportunities to selectively deploy capital toward high yield development projects.  Additionally, as the 5G revolution begins to unlock new capabilities, we're beginning to see incremental deployments resulting from AR, VR, gaming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other next generation use cases which require lower latency. We would only expect this trend to accelerate and drive more demand for our data center campuses over the coming years, while pushing storage and compute requirements further out to the network edge.  And when we combine our differentiated data center portfolio, CSP and network operator relationships with our distributed U.S. macro tower portfolio, and long standing MNO partnerships, we believe we have a significantly enhanced option to create value as the edge evolves over the coming years.  In summary, we're more excited than ever for the opportunity to extend on our long track record of strong profitable growth in the U.S. As the 5G environment continues to take shape, we believe we're uniquely positioned to drive continued long-term value for shareholders, while playing a critical role as an industry leader in this evolving 5G landscape.  Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the horrific events unfolding in Ukraine today. It's hard for any of us to comprehend the suffering of those affected by this humanitarian crisis. And while we do not have operations or employees in Ukraine, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those we have lost, and to all those who continue to be subjected to this crisis. We like many global organizations are focused on finding ways to help them millions of people who are suffering, both within the country and those who are now refugees elsewhere. And we will look to join with others to contribute to the relief efforts underway.  With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated 2022 outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith : Thanks, Tom. And thanks, everyone for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we're off to a great start in 2022, delivering another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights from the quarter.  First, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint, evidenced by the sequential acceleration of organic tenant billings growth across each of our reported segments. Additionally, organic leasing activity was complemented with nearly 1,450 newly constructed sites in Q1, our eleventh quarter of over 1000 new builds in the last three years, a milestone that was only achieved once prior to 2019.  Second, growth from our recently acquired premier assets Telxius and CoreSite is at the high end of our initial expectations. As a result, we are modestly raising guidance for Europe organic tenant billings growth and the midpoint of our datacenter segment revenues.  Additionally, in Europe, we recently signed an agreement with 1&1 in Germany, establishing a leasing framework to support their network rollout, which we expect to be another solid catalyst for growth in an already strong leasing market. We believe this further speaks to the quality and strategic positioning of our acquired Telxius assets, the opportune timing of the transaction and our optimism for the future.  And finally, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment grade balance sheet. And we're able to issue $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes on attractive terms, right after the end of the first quarter. With proceeds used to term out a portion of our floating rate debt.  Looking ahead, and as it relates to our CoreSite financing plan, we continue to explore options that are aimed at maximizing shareholder value while supporting our investment grade credit ratings. Consistent with our prior outlook, we are targeting to finance the $10 billion plus purchase price roughly equally between debt and equity, the latter potentially being satisfied through issuances of common equity, mandatory preferred equity, or other convertible instruments or private capital or a well-balanced combination.  With that, please turn to Slide six and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by 22% or over 23% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period, which included a contribution of approximately 17% in growth from Telxius and CoreSite.  In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue grew under 1% due to the impacts of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 32% or nearly 35%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. Additionally, our newly expanded U.S. datacenter business contributed over $180 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates across our property segments continued to reflect the essential nature of digital services and our communications real estate throughout our served markets.  Moving to the right side of the slide, you'll see our organic tenant billings growth for the quarter, with consolidated growth standing at 3%. In the United States and Canada, while growth was 0.6%, we saw an acceleration of gross organic new business on dollar basis, posting our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020, resulting in a 3.3% contribution to growth.  Given the mechanics of our MLAs and the timing of certain use fees in 2021, we will see a decline in gross organic new business in the second quarter before ramping up in the back half of the year, which was all contemplated in our original 2022 guidance.  Escalators were 3.5%, which is also impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was largely offset by the impacts of Sprint churn. On the international side, growth was 7.4%, and we saw improvements across each of our reported segments. Starting with Latin America, growth came in at roughly 8.7%. This includes approximately 8.5% from escalations, which represents an acceleration of 300 basis points as compared to Q4 2021. Additionally, relatively consistent growth organic leasing trends were largely offset by churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements as highlighted on our Q4 2021 earnings call. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 8%, which includes 7% in gross organic new business contributions, our second highest quarter on record. This strong new leasing activity was complemented by the construction of over 600 sites in the quarter, as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns across the region. We have now constructed over 3,800 sites in Africa since the start of 2020, around the time we closed the Eaton Tower transaction, which meaningfully augmented our scale and enhanced the existing MNO relationships in the region. As a point of reference, prior to the Eaton transaction, we had constructed less than 2,200 sites in the preceding nine years of operations in Africa combined. Turning to Europe. We saw growth of 18.8%, reflecting pronounced contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which was not in our Q1 2021 base. Absent Telxius, our legacy European business grew over 6%, an expansion of 300 basis points as compared to our Q1 2021 growth rate. As we look to the back half of 2022, where we'll have more comparable year-over-year results with Telxius included, we expect to see strong organic tenant billings growth in the mid-7% range, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In APAC, we saw growth of 2.1%, a continuation of the improvements we have seen over the past several quarters as churn further moderates in the India market. In fact, churn is now down to the mid-6% range, the lowest we've seen in nearly five years, which we project to further improve over the course of 2022. Turning to Slide seven. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 13% or nearly 14% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61%, down over 5 percentage points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced Sprint churn, along with the higher pass-through revenue resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by roughly 6% and nearly 4% respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the timing of cash taxes and maintenance CapEx in 2021, which was heavily back-end weighted. The contributions of these two line items provided a negative year-over-year growth headwind of approximately 5% on AFFO in the quarter. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, due to higher pass-through revenue associated with rising fuel costs, strong underlying trends in the business and modest FX improvements, we're increasing our property revenue outlook by $75 million at the midpoint. It's important to note that we continue to apply our standard methodology for projecting FX across our regions, taking the more conservative of the trailing 30-day spot rate averages and an aggregation of bank estimates. When applying current spot rates, we would actually see improvement beyond these revised assumptions, although we believe it's prudent to continue with our standard approach. Second, through solid conversion of our top line upside, the carryforward of some cost benefits and strong services performance in Q1, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $55 million. At an attributable AFFO per share level, we are raising our guide at the midpoint to $9.72, an increase of $0.02. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our prior guidance assumptions around the equity financing for CoreSite. With that, let's move into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide eight, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 14% at the midpoint. The increase, as compared to prior guidance, is due to approximately $66 million in additional international pass-through and straight-line revenue, $7 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with another $2 million in FX benefits. Moving to Slide nine, you'll see our revised organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2022. With the leasing environment remaining largely consistent across our footprint, we are reiterating our prior growth rates for Latin America, APAC, international, U.S. and Canada and on a total consolidated basis. We are modestly raising our expectations for Africa, driven by stronger new business in Europe mainly due to higher CPI-driven escalation contributions. As such, we now expect organic growth of greater than 6% and greater than 9% in Africa and Europe, respectively. Moving to Slide 10. And as noted earlier, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $55 million and now expect year-over-year growth of roughly 10.5%. These revised expectations include $26 million from cash gross margin outperformance, driven by the increase in our revenue guidance and some services margin expansion, partially offset by higher pass-through expenses. We also now expect an additional $19 million in net straight line and another $10 million associated with revised FX assumptions. Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $10 million at the midpoint. As the benefits from the operational and FX upside I just mentioned are being partially offset by higher interest expenses, the result of an elevated rate curve since our last call. This translates to an increase of $0.02 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.72. As I mentioned earlier, and consistent with our initial outlook, our AFFO guidance includes an assumption for the CoreSite equity financing, which, for modeling purposes, assumes a common equity issuance by midyear. However, we continue to evaluate several potential sources, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferred equity and other convertible instruments and also private capital partnerships, where discussions continue to progress as a result of strong interest from leading private investors for a minority stake in our U.S. data center business.  That said, we remain flexible in our approach, with the final mix ultimately depending upon what course offers the most attractive cost of capital terms and operational flexibility. Finally, with respect to the balance sheet management, following our recent senior unsecured note issuance, which I highlighted earlier, and pro forma for executing our equity financing, we will have termed out a significant balance of our floating rate debt and would expect to bring our net leverage to the high 5 times range, with a clear path to returning to our target range of 3 to 5 times over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2022, which are consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continued focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. As always, distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top priority, and we continue to expect to allocate, subject to Board approval, approximately $2.8 billion towards our dividend in 2022. On a per share basis, this equates to approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth, consistent with our double-digit target. On the CapEx front, we are reiterating our prior outlook midpoints across all categories. This plan supports our initial expectations to construct approximately 6,500 new sites across our international footprint and includes roughly $300 million towards our data center business, $270 million of which is tied to development projects.  We will continue to prioritize our development opportunities across our global footprint given its strong return profile and our ability to largely fund these initiatives through locally generated cash flows. In fact, of the nearly 1,450 sites we constructed in Q1, we saw an average day 01 NOI yield of 14%, at the high end of the double-digit initial return rates we've seen through our build program historically. Looking ahead, our development pipeline remains strong, with opportunities afforded by our scale, market positions, customer relationships, operational capabilities and solid underlying secular trends, which continue to drive strong demand across the portfolio. Finally, on Slide 13 and in summary, Q1 was a fantastic start to the year, with organic tenant billings growth accelerating sequentially across each of our reported segments as 5G deployments, 4G densification initiatives and the benefits of our comprehensive MLA agreements drive strong organic new leasing and increasing demand for newly constructed sites. We see the same secular trends driving solid performance on the datacenter front, and we could not be happier with the assets and team we've added through the CoreSite and data site acquisitions. We continue to be encouraged by the demand trends across our global portfolio of distributed communications real estate and look forward to executing on a number of strategic initiatives, including finalizing our CoreSite financing through the rest of the year, as we aim to deliver compelling total returns to our stockholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. \nMatthew Niknam : Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two, if I could. First, on Europe. So we've heard a lot of press around larger carrier portfolios coming to market there. I'm wondering how you think about the prospects of scaling up in Europe further through the lens of either full ownership versus partnering with a financial sponsor as you've done in the past? And then already in light of leverage, sitting at 6.4 turns right now. And then secondly, on CoreSite, obviously, this was the first full quarter with CoreSite under your belt. I'm wondering if there are any positive or negative surprises you can share. And then, Rod, I think you alluded to maybe a little bit of an increased outlook for the data center business, if there's any color or additional detail you can give? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Matt, let me start off, and Rod can add in as he see. First of all, within Europe, we're -- first of all, both Telxius as well as our CoreSite acquisition are hitting on all cylinders. They're both outperforming our expectations kind of right out of the gate. And so in Europe, we're very focused on really realizing the full potential with Telxius. As Rod said, we just landed the transaction with 1&1. So our focus is really on the final integration steps with Telxius and really leveraging that capability in the markets that we're in. So we're really pleased with the teams there and the contracts there and the relationship with Telefonica. With regards to CoreSite, they had a record retail and scale quarter. And so we're really pleased with what we've seen there. We've got a terrific management team in place, a good balance between activity between the retail scale and hyperscale types of business. I've got our sights set on building out some of the existing infrastructure that we have available to us. So on both transactions, we couldn't be more pleased with the activity that we're seeing right out of the gate.\nRod Smith: Yes, good morning Matt. Thanks for joining us, and thanks for the question. I'll add a couple of points on CoreSite. So we are seeing positive trends in CoreSite. You've heard us say it before, we continue to view the asset as a very unique high-quality asset, and we're seeing the quality of the asset come through early on here in the financials. So we did have a terrific end of the year last year in terms of new and expansion revenue being added. We do see that accelerating into 2022. So that's really positive. That allowed us to increase the midpoint of the revenues by about $5 million. And we have seen the backlog for that measure kind of come up. We're sitting at about $19 million backlog versus a year ago same period where it was around $9 million. So that's up about $10 million. And we -- across the major metrics here, we think the business is really strong. In terms of revenue growth, the range we look at is between 6% and 8%. We're looking at the high end of that range, maybe even a touch above that range here. The escalators are in the range of 2% to 4%. Interconnection growth, our target range is between 6% and 8%, and again, we'll be at the high end of that range. We believe cash mark-to-market in the range of 2.3. We'll have to see exactly where that ends up. It always can be affected by kind of unique renewals from certain customers, with the range there is about 2% to 3% on an ongoing basis. The monthly recurring revenue per cabinet, we look at growth rates of 4% to 6% range. Again, we're in the mid-single digits for this year. So that is compelling. The churn rate is the right where we expected them to be in the middle of the range, the range is 6% to 8%. So we're taking on all cylinders with the business. I think it really demonstrates the quality of the asset. The fact customers of this business really do enjoy the interconnection nature and the cloud-centric nature of these assets. And from a CapEx perspective, we put in about 2% of revenue back in maintenance CapEx. And for growth CapEx, we've got about $300 million going into the business this year, really to build out additional capacity. Hopefully, that gives you some color, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on the 1&1 relationship, the new MLA you signed. Is that kind of driving a faster organic growth outlook in Europe than you previously had anticipated? And then secondly, I just wanted to take your temperature on the potential to do future data center M&A. Obviously, CoreSite only in eight markets. Are you seeing some opportunities out there, whether internationally or perhaps in secondary markets in the U.S. that might be interesting to further scale that platform? Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Let me -- I'll take the first -- or the second one, Rod, you could take the first one on 1&1. First of all, with regards to the data centers, we're really leveraging what we have acquired at the end of last year. And we're very focused on further developing that business, working very much on just the fundamentals of expanding sales, extending distribution, developing the campuses, market expansion, leveraging the interconnection capabilities that they have. And then secondly, looking at unlocking the opportunities at the edge. And so I think what you will see in the CoreSite transaction, yes, there will be further build-out of existing resources. There are expansions into -- up in Silicon Valley, we have a fairly sizable new asset that we're looking to build up there. And really just trying to, again, unlock the edge and work jointly with both of our customer sets on figuring out how we can play a meaningful role in that development. So the U.S. is our first project in terms of trying to work through all of these opportunities here. We remain really excited about the opportunity there. The kinds of conversations that we're having with the various potential customers are really exciting for us. It's going to take a while for this to unfold. But that's really where our focus is. And so we don't see -- our towers are our business. That's the reason that we did this transaction to begin with, to further develop the revenue that we're going to be able to enjoy at the tower side. And so that's where our focus is going to be. And then on 1&1, Rod?\nRod Smith: Yes. Thanks, Tom, and thanks, Eric. So with 1&1, we are pleased that we have the agreement with 1&1. We're really looking forward to help them build out their greenfield 5G network across Germany. So that really is very exciting. The deal that we struck really is a framework around how the two parties will work together contractually. It also kind of lays out and gives 1&1 kind of that framework to access our sites. So that's exciting. There are long-term contracts kind of embedded in there. So we'll work through that. It's not really driving additional growth in our 2022 organic tenant billings yet, although we do think it's a very exciting development that will provide growth over the long-term and maybe even pick up in the back half of this year a little bit. But maybe, Eric, I'll hit a couple of points on the growth rates here in Europe. So you saw the announcement earlier in the presentation. We did have organic tenant billings growth in Europe in the high teens. A lot of that is driven by the Telxius assets, which is, again, a really high-quality asset across Europe, particularly in Germany. We do expect that momentum to continue, at least in terms of the leasing activity, but the -- when you get out into the back half of the year, when you bring the Telxius base revenue into the equation, we expect organic tenant billings growth for Europe to moderate and drop down into the 7% range, maybe between 7% and 8%. So still very strong growth. If you exclude Telxius and you just look at Germany -- I mean, just look at Europe legacy business, that business for Q1 grew greater than 6% on an organic tenant billings growth basis. That compares to a year ago same period at only 3%, 3.5%. So we're seeing really good growth momentum in Europe on the OTP metric on the legacy business as well as being assisted with the high-quality assets from Telxius. And we do think 1&1 will be a kind of a multiyear additional benefit as we go forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about the domestic leasing environment in terms of that multiyear visibility that you previously been speaking to? And how that visibility is evolving for the business?\nRod Smith: Yes, sure. Thanks for joining us. So I'll just remind you in terms of the long-term guidance that we have out there, it was over a 7-year average really going out to 2027, and we were looking at, at least 4% growth over that time on average reported and on a normalized basis, excluding the impact -- the negative impact of the profit would be up 5%. You know what that metric looked like in '21, and now you see kind of where we're guiding in '22. We'll hit an average of about 2% for those two years on a reported basis. And if you exclude, again, normalized for the Sprint churn, that would be up around 5%. And we're actually seeing that in Q1 in terms of our U.S. organic growth, which came in at about 0.6% for the quarter. And that did have an impact from Sprint churn that was pretty close to 4%. So that would have been up in the mid- to upper 4s if you normalize through the Sprint churn. So that's certainly where we expect to hit. If you look at the '23 to '27-time period, we would look at reported organic tenant billings growth being greater than 5%, greater than or equal to 5%. And on a normalized basis, around 6% greater than or equal to 6%. So we do see that acceleration kind of in momentum. We think we're in for a nice run here a really stable long-term healthy growth in the U.S. business once we work through the Sprint churn. And in these numbers, it's important to point out that two-thirds of the -- not just the underlying revenue, but also the growth is already contracted in the MLAs that we have the holistic MLAs. And it does include the acceleration and the partnership we have with DISH in terms of that agreement where revenue begins this year. It accelerates through the year, and then it will be there over the long-term. So hopefully, that gives you a little color, Michael, in terms of the U.S. growth rates.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nAlex Waters: Hi, good morning, Rod. This is Alex Waters on for Dave. Maybe just my first one here. Rod, you hit on a -- in your prepared remarks, but could you elaborate a little bit more on the plans for the size and the timing of the CoreSite equity raise? I think in the past you said it was 2Q and nice tip into 3Q? And then how have the plans evolved to include private capital there?\nRod Smith: Yes. Thanks, Alex. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we're working through the financing plan. We're very excited at the prospects and the different opportunities we have. As I said in our prepared remarks, we're looking at equity and equity component. That's really the final piece of the entire CoreSite financing. We ended the quarter here at about 4.6 times leverage. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. And we do have a plan to delever over the next couple of years. So we expect by the end of the year to get into the mid- to upper 5 times. So that's where the equity component comes in. We're looking at raising about $5 billion from an equity transaction. That's what's in our base model. And the outlook just to reiterate here, the base plan, assumes that we're going to do a common equity issuance for the $5 billion, at roughly $235 a share. That's what's in our 2022 guidance for AFFO and AFFO per share growth. But with that said, we're also looking at other forms of equity. So complementing the common equity with some preferred convertible equity instruments, other kinds of convertible instruments and private capital. So we are looking at private capital options. Much of that has come from inbound inquiries that we've had. When people heard that we were buying CoreSite, I think there was a lot of excitement in the marketplace in terms of the high-quality nature of those assets. So there was a lot of inbound interest there. We also went out with some outbound inquiries, and we've been working through a process. So -- the other thing I would just clarify here, Alex, I think I mixed up the numbers on the leverage. We're ending at 6.4 and I think I may have said 4.6. So again, we're getting back down into the mid- to upper 5s by the end of the year. I think you made a comment in your question that we might be pushing the equity financing into Q3. I'm not sure that's correct, but we're working through the process. There's a good chance that we could have it wrapped up in Q2, like we initially said at the outset of the year.\nTom Bartlett: And I guess, Rod, I would just add, we chose not to change the outlook assumptions. So at the time when we issued that initial outlook, we had the equity at that $5 billion level at the price point level. And as I said, just for clarity, I just want to make sure that we just kept at the same going forward. And obviously, we'll adjust that when Rod finally closes this whole transaction, which, again, we would expect in Q2.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks and good morning everybody. I appreciate you guys have been available. First question is down in Brazil, looks like it's finally making it to the final positioning. Can you update us a little bit about how you see the Oi getting carved into the other three operators as far as what it means to that market? And just what your exposure is?\nTom Bartlett: Sure. Rob, do you want to -- I can...\nRod Smith: Yes, Ric. So -- Oi has kind of finished their process of exiting the market and splitting their business up into the other three remaining carriers. So we do see that as a positive event, taking that -- those leases and putting them with carriers that are financially secure and kind of in a healthy competition in that market. So we think that is certainly going to be productive. We do have a chunk of revenue from Oi. We have about 6.7 -- just about seven years remaining on average on those leases. Ric, in terms of the, the revenue impact to our business, it's less than 1% of our revenues globally that we have with Oi down in Brazil. Even though we have that nearly seven years on average, that's an average, so there could be some leases that come up a little bit earlier than that. And we may see churn beginning as early as next year and kind of moving through the next few years. So we'll be working through that process. But in general, we think it's a healthy thing for the industry there in Brazil. We've been working through kind of the process as Oi has for the last couple of years. So I think it's good to get that behind us and get it behind the wireless segment there in Brazil, so everyone can move forward.\nTom Bartlett: And Ric, I'd just reiterate that I think they're candidly, a very positive event, putting these assets in the hands of Tim Claro and Vivo. And they're very focused on building out further 4G and 5G. So I think this is a real positive for the market.\nOperator: We'll move on to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Go ahead\nBrandon Nispel: I want to follow up on Mike's question. Do you guys continue to expect to be at $150 million in colocation and amendments in the U.S. in '22? And then how should we think about the exit rate in terms of colocation and amendments for modeling purposes for 2023? Is that going to be a good run rate? Thanks. \nTom Bartlett: Yes, Brendan, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we are targeting about $150 million of contribution to organic tenant billings growth through colocation and amendment. The metric for the quarter was about $36 million. So that's an acceleration over the exit out of 2021, and it's higher than any quarter we had in 2021. So we are seeing that acceleration in that gross leasing activity in the U.S. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will see a slight pullback in Q2 in that metric, really just around the mechanics of the way the M&As work in the U.S. But when you get to Q3 and Q4, we'll be above the Q1 total here. So we'll be exiting at a higher level going into next year. I don't want to talk about next year too specifically here and give guidance, but we are seeing an acceleration in that metric. We expected to see that, and we are seeing that. And it's all very constructive and kind of in line with our longer-term organic tenant billings growth guidance for the U.S.\nOperator: We'll move on to the line of Jon Atkin with RBC.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks very much. A couple of questions. I noticed that the -- you talked about $120 million of asset acquisitions, $30 million of which were towers. Can you talk to us a little bit about what comprised the rest?\nRod Smith: Sure, Jonathan. I can give you that. It's really just a variety of small acquisitions on the tower side. Many of them were in Europe. We do have an arrangement with a carrier in Europe, where we consistently buy a number of sites throughout the -- throughout each quarter in Europe. We're also buying a few down in in Latin America, 1s and 2s here and there. We also always have a pipeline in the U.S. where we're rolling up a few acquisitions here and there. And then there's some payments that are related to the prior year deals that we acquired. So there's really not a ton going on. We think about it in terms of Europe and in Latin America, primarily.\nJonathan Atkin: And just interested in the -- SunGuard announced the bankruptcy earlier in April. And I think CoreSite, as a stand-alone company, had kind of alluded to some events around the prepackaged bankruptcy. But now that we're kind of going through the next phase of that, I wondered what impacts you're seeing on your data center business from that type of event?\nRod Smith: No, Jon, we're not expecting anything material from that perspective. We don't see it -- we don't see any real negatives. Nothing meaningful to note. So we're committed and kind of confident in the growth rates that I outlined a little earlier in the call.\nOperator: And our next question will be from Batya Levi with UBS. Go ahead.\nBatya Levi : Thank you. In the U.S., can you talk a little bit about the activity you're seeing from DISH? And fixed wireless is ramping faster than we had expected. I know it's still very small, and the carriers have a lot of hollowed capacity. But anecdotally, do you see any change in carrier activity on the side where usage is increasing significantly? I want to get your thoughts on that. And then another question on -- in terms of the pulse build, you have a significant build program this year on development CapEx. Can you talk about your sort of what you're seeing in terms of the cost versus your expectations and any delays?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, thank you Batya. On the continued build-out in the U.S., I mean, yes, there are -- I think the carriers have all said they're interested in continually building out fixed wireless, but that's not getting in the way in terms of their capital spend on really building out 5G. And so we would expect, again, kind of the continued acceleration of that 5G build really accelerating, as Rod said, kind of in the second half of the year. Spectra being cleared and being able to be put in place. We're excited about the prospects for that 5G build. I don't think the carriers are going to let anything get in the way of that opportunity going forward. And on the build side, I just want to say, this is of the last 12 quarters, 11 of them have built over 1,000 new builds. And that's going to contribute significantly to our overall growth rate in '22 as it has in '21. We've laid out a path of looking at north of 40,000 builds over the next several years, and have visibility into contracts with all of our existing customers to do so. Rod mentioned the build that's going on in Africa. We see equally build going on in Europe, clearly in India as well as in Latin America. So we're really excited about the build program. We're looking at over 6,000 new builds in '22. And as I mentioned, I'm hoping that, that will continue to accelerate going forward.\nRod Smith: And Batya, I'll give you a couple of specific numbers here. On the costs -- you mentioned the cost of the builds. They're coming in at a little less than 100,000 on average, maybe closer to 75,000 on average per site. And we are continuing to see the targeted NOI yields being in the low to mid-teens. So we're in the range of about 14% now, which is great. Regarding to your question on DISH, we are seeing activity from DISH in the U.S., we did last year, as you know, and that continues this year. We see it mostly showing up in our financials through our services business. So we're continuing to have strong volume and activity in our services business. We're projecting in and around $225 million to $230 million in services revenue for this year. Last year, it was up to about $250 million. So there's a slight pullback there. But if you think about our services activity for the first quarter of 2022, it's almost 100% growth over that same time period in last year. And certainly, the DISH greenfield build is a big part of that. And if you rewind back to 2020, our services business was driving less than $100 million in revenue. So we've seen that step up in our services, which really highlights the level of activity that we're seeing in the U.S. And again, DISH is part of that. We'll begin to see leasing revenue here this year from DISH, and that will ramp in the back half of the year. And we'll exit at, of course, a much high level of leasing revenue from DISH than we entered the year. And then that will ramp and continue for years to come.\nOperator: We'll go now to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey guys, thanks. A couple, if I can. First, if you can -- if I can follow up on the capital raise report site. If you were working on a large European deal, would that be material enough that it would be hard to raise public equity in the meantime? Or is that not something that's an issue? And then second, can you dig into your comments about the expected decline in gross organic new business in the second quarter before you said ramping up in the back half of the year? And is that alluding to the Verizon MLA expiration? It doesn't seem like that impacted the first quarter at all?\nRod Smith: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Thanks for joining the call and thanks for the question. So in terms of the capital raise, I mean, I don't want to get into too much hypothetical there. A lot of different deals over in Europe, a lot of different stuff. I don't want to guess in terms of the level of capital that potentially could be needed. I would tell you, our equities are really strong. We've got a lot of support in the equity markets. If we wanted to go out and raise equity, we're very confident that we can do that for the right value accretive deal for our shareholders. So that's what I would say in terms of the potential for any other acquisitions and in issuing equity. Certainly, we'll continue to be active and looking around. We like the transaction that we have in Europe. We like what we're seeing in the Telxius business. We think that was a high-quality set of assets with really good contracts, and we purchased it at the right time. So from a European perspective, we like exactly where we sit today, and we are focused on financing the CoreSite opportunity as well. Jumping over to the deceleration from Q1 to Q2 in our OTBG contributions from colocations and amendments, it's dropping down from like the mid-30s for Q1 into the low 30s for Q2. It's not Verizon-driven, it's really just mechanics of the MLAs and where some use right fees kick in early in the year. And then we do see that ramping up, and we expect it to be in the range of 40 plus each of the final two quarters in the year. So that's kind of the way to think about that ramp. There's nothing concerning about the step down in Q2. It's all just MLA mechanics, and we feel very good about the level of activity in the position of our U.S. portfolio.\nTom Bartlett: Phil, let me just reiterate, As I said all along, the CoreSite capital raise is not impacting how we think at all about future tower opportunities. We'll stop.\nOperator: We have time for one final question. That will come from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: Thank you very much for the question. First, I wanted to just get a better sense on how you think about the CoreSite business from a pricing and renewal perspective. And I know you mentioned that business for retail colo and other parts also were very strong last quarter, but what is kind of the strategy at A&T? Are you guys looking to kind of just take a bigger share out of the market by lowering pricing a little bit and winning a bigger chunk? Or are you maintaining pricing discipline as legacy CoreSite and seeing kind of the revisions and renewals as kind of as strong as what CoreSite was reported for they were taken out by you guys? Just trying to get a better idea on the strategy and the vision of CoreSite under AMT.\nTom Bartlett: And let me just -- I can start, and Rod can get it. We're very focused on pricing discipline. I mean the assets that they have and what the business is doing with its own fabric within, we think can support this high single-digit, low double-digit kind of growth rate going forward. And so the team is very focused on extending distribution into all its 3 major pieces, really driving new and expansion sales, working on those renewals, developing the campus and market expansion, leveraging interconnection. So really driving organic growth from existing customers and bring -- getting new business from high-quality new ones and driving new logos within the business. So no change at all in terms of the direction and the discipline that the team brings to the marketplace. We are -- have increased some of the funding to be able to accelerate some of the build-out so that there's more opportunity for growth. But the underlying discipline in terms of how they have approached the business is what we acquired. And we're very excited about continuing that same type of discipline going forward.\nOperator: And with that, we'll turn the conference call back over to your host.\nAdam Smith: Thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to me or the IR team with any further questions. Thanks again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay, beginning today, April 27, at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, running through May 11, 2022 at midnight.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. And thanks, everyone for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we're off to a great start in 2022, delivering another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights from the quarter.  First, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint, evidenced by the sequential acceleration of organic tenant billings growth across each of our reported segments. Additionally, organic leasing activity was complemented with nearly 1,450 newly constructed sites in Q1, our eleventh quarter of over 1000 new builds in the last three years, a milestone that was only achieved once prior to 2019.  Second, growth from our recently acquired premier assets Telxius and CoreSite is at the high end of our initial expectations. As a result, we are modestly raising guidance for Europe organic tenant billings growth and the midpoint of our datacenter segment revenues.  Additionally, in Europe, we recently signed an agreement with 1&1 in Germany, establishing a leasing framework to support their network rollout, which we expect to be another solid catalyst for growth in an already strong leasing market. We believe this further speaks to the quality and strategic positioning of our acquired Telxius assets, the opportune timing of the transaction and our optimism for the future.  And finally, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment grade balance sheet. And we're able to issue $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes on attractive terms, right after the end of the first quarter. With proceeds used to term out a portion of our floating rate debt.  Looking ahead, and as it relates to our CoreSite financing plan, we continue to explore options that are aimed at maximizing shareholder value while supporting our investment grade credit ratings. Consistent with our prior outlook, we are targeting to finance the $10 billion plus purchase price roughly equally between debt and equity, the latter potentially being satisfied through issuances of common equity, mandatory preferred equity, or other convertible instruments or private capital or a well-balanced combination.  With that, please turn to Slide six and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by 22% or over 23% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period, which included a contribution of approximately 17% in growth from Telxius and CoreSite.  In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue grew under 1% due to the impacts of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 32% or nearly 35%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. Additionally, our newly expanded U.S. datacenter business contributed over $180 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates across our property segments continued to reflect the essential nature of digital services and our communications real estate throughout our served markets.  Moving to the right side of the slide, you'll see our organic tenant billings growth for the quarter, with consolidated growth standing at 3%. In the United States and Canada, while growth was 0.6%, we saw an acceleration of gross organic new business on dollar basis, posting our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020, resulting in a 3.3% contribution to growth.  Given the mechanics of our MLAs and the timing of certain use fees in 2021, we will see a decline in gross organic new business in the second quarter before ramping up in the back half of the year, which was all contemplated in our original 2022 guidance.  Escalators were 3.5%, which is also impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was largely offset by the impacts of Sprint churn. On the international side, growth was 7.4%, and we saw improvements across each of our reported segments. Starting with Latin America, growth came in at roughly 8.7%. This includes approximately 8.5% from escalations, which represents an acceleration of 300 basis points as compared to Q4 2021. Additionally, relatively consistent growth organic leasing trends were largely offset by churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements as highlighted on our Q4 2021 earnings call. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 8%, which includes 7% in gross organic new business contributions, our second highest quarter on record. This strong new leasing activity was complemented by the construction of over 600 sites in the quarter, as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns across the region. We have now constructed over 3,800 sites in Africa since the start of 2020, around the time we closed the Eaton Tower transaction, which meaningfully augmented our scale and enhanced the existing MNO relationships in the region. As a point of reference, prior to the Eaton transaction, we had constructed less than 2,200 sites in the preceding nine years of operations in Africa combined. Turning to Europe. We saw growth of 18.8%, reflecting pronounced contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which was not in our Q1 2021 base. Absent Telxius, our legacy European business grew over 6%, an expansion of 300 basis points as compared to our Q1 2021 growth rate. As we look to the back half of 2022, where we'll have more comparable year-over-year results with Telxius included, we expect to see strong organic tenant billings growth in the mid-7% range, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In APAC, we saw growth of 2.1%, a continuation of the improvements we have seen over the past several quarters as churn further moderates in the India market. In fact, churn is now down to the mid-6% range, the lowest we've seen in nearly five years, which we project to further improve over the course of 2022. Turning to Slide seven. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 13% or nearly 14% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61%, down over 5 percentage points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced Sprint churn, along with the higher pass-through revenue resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by roughly 6% and nearly 4% respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the timing of cash taxes and maintenance CapEx in 2021, which was heavily back-end weighted. The contributions of these two line items provided a negative year-over-year growth headwind of approximately 5% on AFFO in the quarter. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, due to higher pass-through revenue associated with rising fuel costs, strong underlying trends in the business and modest FX improvements, we're increasing our property revenue outlook by $75 million at the midpoint. It's important to note that we continue to apply our standard methodology for projecting FX across our regions, taking the more conservative of the trailing 30-day spot rate averages and an aggregation of bank estimates. When applying current spot rates, we would actually see improvement beyond these revised assumptions, although we believe it's prudent to continue with our standard approach. Second, through solid conversion of our top line upside, the carryforward of some cost benefits and strong services performance in Q1, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $55 million. At an attributable AFFO per share level, we are raising our guide at the midpoint to $9.72, an increase of $0.02. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our prior guidance assumptions around the equity financing for CoreSite. With that, let's move into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide eight, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 14% at the midpoint. The increase, as compared to prior guidance, is due to approximately $66 million in additional international pass-through and straight-line revenue, $7 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with another $2 million in FX benefits. Moving to Slide nine, you'll see our revised organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2022. With the leasing environment remaining largely consistent across our footprint, we are reiterating our prior growth rates for Latin America, APAC, international, U.S. and Canada and on a total consolidated basis. We are modestly raising our expectations for Africa, driven by stronger new business in Europe mainly due to higher CPI-driven escalation contributions. As such, we now expect organic growth of greater than 6% and greater than 9% in Africa and Europe, respectively. Moving to Slide 10. And as noted earlier, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $55 million and now expect year-over-year growth of roughly 10.5%. These revised expectations include $26 million from cash gross margin outperformance, driven by the increase in our revenue guidance and some services margin expansion, partially offset by higher pass-through expenses. We also now expect an additional $19 million in net straight line and another $10 million associated with revised FX assumptions. Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $10 million at the midpoint. As the benefits from the operational and FX upside I just mentioned are being partially offset by higher interest expenses, the result of an elevated rate curve since our last call. This translates to an increase of $0.02 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.72. As I mentioned earlier, and consistent with our initial outlook, our AFFO guidance includes an assumption for the CoreSite equity financing, which, for modeling purposes, assumes a common equity issuance by midyear. However, we continue to evaluate several potential sources, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferred equity and other convertible instruments and also private capital partnerships, where discussions continue to progress as a result of strong interest from leading private investors for a minority stake in our U.S. data center business.  That said, we remain flexible in our approach, with the final mix ultimately depending upon what course offers the most attractive cost of capital terms and operational flexibility. Finally, with respect to the balance sheet management, following our recent senior unsecured note issuance, which I highlighted earlier, and pro forma for executing our equity financing, we will have termed out a significant balance of our floating rate debt and would expect to bring our net leverage to the high 5 times range, with a clear path to returning to our target range of 3 to 5 times over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2022, which are consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continued focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. As always, distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top priority, and we continue to expect to allocate, subject to Board approval, approximately $2.8 billion towards our dividend in 2022. On a per share basis, this equates to approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth, consistent with our double-digit target. On the CapEx front, we are reiterating our prior outlook midpoints across all categories. This plan supports our initial expectations to construct approximately 6,500 new sites across our international footprint and includes roughly $300 million towards our data center business, $270 million of which is tied to development projects.  We will continue to prioritize our development opportunities across our global footprint given its strong return profile and our ability to largely fund these initiatives through locally generated cash flows. In fact, of the nearly 1,450 sites we constructed in Q1, we saw an average day 01 NOI yield of 14%, at the high end of the double-digit initial return rates we've seen through our build program historically. Looking ahead, our development pipeline remains strong, with opportunities afforded by our scale, market positions, customer relationships, operational capabilities and solid underlying secular trends, which continue to drive strong demand across the portfolio. Finally, on Slide 13 and in summary, Q1 was a fantastic start to the year, with organic tenant billings growth accelerating sequentially across each of our reported segments as 5G deployments, 4G densification initiatives and the benefits of our comprehensive MLA agreements drive strong organic new leasing and increasing demand for newly constructed sites. We see the same secular trends driving solid performance on the datacenter front, and we could not be happier with the assets and team we've added through the CoreSite and data site acquisitions. We continue to be encouraged by the demand trends across our global portfolio of distributed communications real estate and look forward to executing on a number of strategic initiatives, including finalizing our CoreSite financing through the rest of the year, as we aim to deliver compelling total returns to our stockholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes, good morning Matt. Thanks for joining us, and thanks for the question. I'll add a couple of points on CoreSite. So we are seeing positive trends in CoreSite. You've heard us say it before, we continue to view the asset as a very unique high-quality asset, and we're seeing the quality of the asset come through early on here in the financials. So we did have a terrific end of the year last year in terms of new and expansion revenue being added. We do see that accelerating into 2022. So that's really positive. That allowed us to increase the midpoint of the revenues by about $5 million. And we have seen the backlog for that measure kind of come up. We're sitting at about $19 million backlog versus a year ago same period where it was around $9 million. So that's up about $10 million. And we -- across the major metrics here, we think the business is really strong. In terms of revenue growth, the range we look at is between 6% and 8%. We're looking at the high end of that range, maybe even a touch above that range here. The escalators are in the range of 2% to 4%. Interconnection growth, our target range is between 6% and 8%, and again, we'll be at the high end of that range. We believe cash mark-to-market in the range of 2.3. We'll have to see exactly where that ends up. It always can be affected by kind of unique renewals from certain customers, with the range there is about 2% to 3% on an ongoing basis. The monthly recurring revenue per cabinet, we look at growth rates of 4% to 6% range. Again, we're in the mid-single digits for this year. So that is compelling. The churn rate is the right where we expected them to be in the middle of the range, the range is 6% to 8%. So we're taking on all cylinders with the business. I think it really demonstrates the quality of the asset. The fact customers of this business really do enjoy the interconnection nature and the cloud-centric nature of these assets. And from a CapEx perspective, we put in about 2% of revenue back in maintenance CapEx. And for growth CapEx, we've got about $300 million going into the business this year, really to build out additional capacity. Hopefully, that gives you some color, Matt. Yes. Thanks, Tom, and thanks, Eric. So with 1&1, we are pleased that we have the agreement with 1&1. We're really looking forward to help them build out their greenfield 5G network across Germany. So that really is very exciting. The deal that we struck really is a framework around how the two parties will work together contractually. It also kind of lays out and gives 1&1 kind of that framework to access our sites. So that's exciting. There are long-term contracts kind of embedded in there. So we'll work through that. It's not really driving additional growth in our 2022 organic tenant billings yet, although we do think it's a very exciting development that will provide growth over the long-term and maybe even pick up in the back half of this year a little bit. But maybe, Eric, I'll hit a couple of points on the growth rates here in Europe. So you saw the announcement earlier in the presentation. We did have organic tenant billings growth in Europe in the high teens. A lot of that is driven by the Telxius assets, which is, again, a really high-quality asset across Europe, particularly in Germany. We do expect that momentum to continue, at least in terms of the leasing activity, but the -- when you get out into the back half of the year, when you bring the Telxius base revenue into the equation, we expect organic tenant billings growth for Europe to moderate and drop down into the 7% range, maybe between 7% and 8%. So still very strong growth. If you exclude Telxius and you just look at Germany -- I mean, just look at Europe legacy business, that business for Q1 grew greater than 6% on an organic tenant billings growth basis. That compares to a year ago same period at only 3%, 3.5%. So we're seeing really good growth momentum in Europe on the OTP metric on the legacy business as well as being assisted with the high-quality assets from Telxius. And we do think 1&1 will be a kind of a multiyear additional benefit as we go forward. Yes, sure. Thanks for joining us. So I'll just remind you in terms of the long-term guidance that we have out there, it was over a 7-year average really going out to 2027, and we were looking at, at least 4% growth over that time on average reported and on a normalized basis, excluding the impact -- the negative impact of the profit would be up 5%. You know what that metric looked like in '21, and now you see kind of where we're guiding in '22. We'll hit an average of about 2% for those two years on a reported basis. And if you exclude, again, normalized for the Sprint churn, that would be up around 5%. And we're actually seeing that in Q1 in terms of our U.S. organic growth, which came in at about 0.6% for the quarter. And that did have an impact from Sprint churn that was pretty close to 4%. So that would have been up in the mid- to upper 4s if you normalize through the Sprint churn. So that's certainly where we expect to hit. If you look at the '23 to '27-time period, we would look at reported organic tenant billings growth being greater than 5%, greater than or equal to 5%. And on a normalized basis, around 6% greater than or equal to 6%. So we do see that acceleration kind of in momentum. We think we're in for a nice run here a really stable long-term healthy growth in the U.S. business once we work through the Sprint churn. And in these numbers, it's important to point out that two-thirds of the -- not just the underlying revenue, but also the growth is already contracted in the MLAs that we have the holistic MLAs. And it does include the acceleration and the partnership we have with DISH in terms of that agreement where revenue begins this year. It accelerates through the year, and then it will be there over the long-term. So hopefully, that gives you a little color, Michael, in terms of the U.S. growth rates. Yes. Thanks, Alex. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we're working through the financing plan. We're very excited at the prospects and the different opportunities we have. As I said in our prepared remarks, we're looking at equity and equity component. That's really the final piece of the entire CoreSite financing. We ended the quarter here at about 4.6 times leverage. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. And we do have a plan to delever over the next couple of years. So we expect by the end of the year to get into the mid- to upper 5 times. So that's where the equity component comes in. We're looking at raising about $5 billion from an equity transaction. That's what's in our base model. And the outlook just to reiterate here, the base plan, assumes that we're going to do a common equity issuance for the $5 billion, at roughly $235 a share. That's what's in our 2022 guidance for AFFO and AFFO per share growth. But with that said, we're also looking at other forms of equity. So complementing the common equity with some preferred convertible equity instruments, other kinds of convertible instruments and private capital. So we are looking at private capital options. Much of that has come from inbound inquiries that we've had. When people heard that we were buying CoreSite, I think there was a lot of excitement in the marketplace in terms of the high-quality nature of those assets. So there was a lot of inbound interest there. We also went out with some outbound inquiries, and we've been working through a process. So -- the other thing I would just clarify here, Alex, I think I mixed up the numbers on the leverage. We're ending at 6.4 and I think I may have said 4.6. So again, we're getting back down into the mid- to upper 5s by the end of the year. I think you made a comment in your question that we might be pushing the equity financing into Q3. I'm not sure that's correct, but we're working through the process. There's a good chance that we could have it wrapped up in Q2, like we initially said at the outset of the year. Yes, Ric. So -- Oi has kind of finished their process of exiting the market and splitting their business up into the other three remaining carriers. So we do see that as a positive event, taking that -- those leases and putting them with carriers that are financially secure and kind of in a healthy competition in that market. So we think that is certainly going to be productive. We do have a chunk of revenue from Oi. We have about 6.7 -- just about seven years remaining on average on those leases. Ric, in terms of the, the revenue impact to our business, it's less than 1% of our revenues globally that we have with Oi down in Brazil. Even though we have that nearly seven years on average, that's an average, so there could be some leases that come up a little bit earlier than that. And we may see churn beginning as early as next year and kind of moving through the next few years. So we'll be working through that process. But in general, we think it's a healthy thing for the industry there in Brazil. We've been working through kind of the process as Oi has for the last couple of years. So I think it's good to get that behind us and get it behind the wireless segment there in Brazil, so everyone can move forward. Sure, Jonathan. I can give you that. It's really just a variety of small acquisitions on the tower side. Many of them were in Europe. We do have an arrangement with a carrier in Europe, where we consistently buy a number of sites throughout the -- throughout each quarter in Europe. We're also buying a few down in in Latin America, 1s and 2s here and there. We also always have a pipeline in the U.S. where we're rolling up a few acquisitions here and there. And then there's some payments that are related to the prior year deals that we acquired. So there's really not a ton going on. We think about it in terms of Europe and in Latin America, primarily. No, Jon, we're not expecting anything material from that perspective. We don't see it -- we don't see any real negatives. Nothing meaningful to note. So we're committed and kind of confident in the growth rates that I outlined a little earlier in the call. And Batya, I'll give you a couple of specific numbers here. On the costs -- you mentioned the cost of the builds. They're coming in at a little less than 100,000 on average, maybe closer to 75,000 on average per site. And we are continuing to see the targeted NOI yields being in the low to mid-teens. So we're in the range of about 14% now, which is great. Regarding to your question on DISH, we are seeing activity from DISH in the U.S., we did last year, as you know, and that continues this year. We see it mostly showing up in our financials through our services business. So we're continuing to have strong volume and activity in our services business. We're projecting in and around $225 million to $230 million in services revenue for this year. Last year, it was up to about $250 million. So there's a slight pullback there. But if you think about our services activity for the first quarter of 2022, it's almost 100% growth over that same time period in last year. And certainly, the DISH greenfield build is a big part of that. And if you rewind back to 2020, our services business was driving less than $100 million in revenue. So we've seen that step up in our services, which really highlights the level of activity that we're seeing in the U.S. And again, DISH is part of that. We'll begin to see leasing revenue here this year from DISH, and that will ramp in the back half of the year. And we'll exit at, of course, a much high level of leasing revenue from DISH than we entered the year. And then that will ramp and continue for years to come. Yes. Thanks, Phil. Thanks for joining the call and thanks for the question. So in terms of the capital raise, I mean, I don't want to get into too much hypothetical there. A lot of different deals over in Europe, a lot of different stuff. I don't want to guess in terms of the level of capital that potentially could be needed. I would tell you, our equities are really strong. We've got a lot of support in the equity markets. If we wanted to go out and raise equity, we're very confident that we can do that for the right value accretive deal for our shareholders. So that's what I would say in terms of the potential for any other acquisitions and in issuing equity. Certainly, we'll continue to be active and looking around. We like the transaction that we have in Europe. We like what we're seeing in the Telxius business. We think that was a high-quality set of assets with really good contracts, and we purchased it at the right time. So from a European perspective, we like exactly where we sit today, and we are focused on financing the CoreSite opportunity as well. Jumping over to the deceleration from Q1 to Q2 in our OTBG contributions from colocations and amendments, it's dropping down from like the mid-30s for Q1 into the low 30s for Q2. It's not Verizon-driven, it's really just mechanics of the MLAs and where some use right fees kick in early in the year. And then we do see that ramping up, and we expect it to be in the range of 40 plus each of the final two quarters in the year. So that's kind of the way to think about that ramp. There's nothing concerning about the step down in Q2. It's all just MLA mechanics, and we feel very good about the level of activity in the position of our U.S. portfolio."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. And thank you everyone for joining our call this morning. In line with our traditional first quarter practice, my comments on this call will primarily focus on our core U.S. and Canadian tower business, which together with our U.S. based data center segment, made up approximately 54% of our total property revenues, and 65% of our total property segment operating profit in the first quarter.  Growth in our foundational U.S. and Canadian business continues to be propelled by the rapid acceleration in mobile data consumption that we've seen over the last decade plus. Back in 2017, the average smartphone in the U.S. was consuming roughly six gigabytes of data per month. And today, in the early stages of 5G uptake by consumers, that number has grown by a staggering 240% to over 20 gigabytes on a monthly basis.  As both 5G handsets and coverage become increasingly pervasive, this upward trend is expected to continue, with industry estimates now forecasting an average monthly consumption rate of 54 gigabytes by 2027. To meet this expected demand, carriers are aggressively deploying mid-band spectrum to provide ubiquitous 5G mobile services.  Historically, annual carrier CapEx in the U.S. has grown by approximately $5 billion to $6 billion, with every newG as MNOs deploy capital to maintain service quality on their increasingly strained networks, and provide incremental capacity and density to meet consumer demand for enhanced network performance.  Early evidence in the 5G cycle suggest this will continue to be the case. In fact, in 2021, we saw carriers increase aggregate network CapEx to approximately $34 billion up from the roughly $30 billion annually, we saw during the 4G cycle. And independent industry reports suggest that this number should continue in the $35 billion range on average going forward.  Further, as we've seen with prior network technology deployments, we expect a prolonged 5G investment cycle that will extend over the next decade. Today, carriers are in the earlier stages of upgrading sites with new equipment to provide broad contiguous 5G coverage across their respective subscriber basis. And given the propagation characteristics of mid-band spectrum, and ever increasing mobile data consumption paired with incremental low latency requirements arising from 5G enabled used cases, we would expect an extended period of investment aimed at delivering greater cell site density and stronger performance across networks for many years to come.  Importantly, it is clear that macro towers will continue to be crucial infrastructure for the long runway of carrier network investments that lie ahead. Macro sites have historically been the most cost effective means for carriers to provide broad base network coverage to the vast majority of the U.S. populace, and evidence suggests that remains unchanged in a 5G world.  To support this point over the last five years, our backlog of contractually guaranteed revenues in the U.S. is more than doubled on a per site basis. This speaks not only to our team's capacity to secure long-term, profitable cash flow growth from more than 43,000 distributed sites, but also to the long-term value our tenants place on our macro tower assets as a critical component of their network deployment strategy for 5G and beyond.  These trends along with the guaranteed growth secure through our comprehensive MLAs support our expectation for strong growth on our tower assets, both in the near and longer term. In 2022, we expect another year of accelerating gross new business growth in the U.S. and Canada. And as we've previously communicated, growth from colocations and amendments, is expected to ramp in the back half of the year with the expectation that we'll exit 2022 on a high point.  With colocation and amendment contributions accelerating and the impacts of the Sprint churn beginning to come off their peaks we are well positioned to execute on a return to strong mid-single digit organic tenant billings growth in 2023 and beyond.  On the operational front, our U.S. teams remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. That allow us to quickly scale up to meet customer needs and maximize the flow through of top-line growth to the bottom line. Over the last few years, we progressed on process and IT initiatives designed to deliver best-in-class cycle times and introduce technology innovations in the field that improves site monitoring and data collection capabilities, while lowering site level operating costs and providing efficiency benefits for our tenants.  In addition, our focus on cost controls has driven cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue in the segment to well below 4%, on a consistent basis, a trend we expect to continue in 2022 and beyond.  As a result, we've been able to continue extending on the significant operating leverage inherent to the tower business model. At the midpoint of our 2022 outlook, we expect an operating profit margin of 78.8%, representing a 370 basis point expansion in the segment over the last five years, even while absorbing the significant impacts of Sprint churn more recently.  This strong conversion of top line growth to profit margin, combined with the low capital intensity of just over 1% positions our U.S. and Canadian business to continue its decades long track record of delivering strong free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond.  With that, I'd like to shift gears for a moment to our data center segment, which we expect to benefit from many of the same long-term technological trends that are driving attractive growth in our tower business. We're off to a great start in our first full quarter of ownership of the CoreSite business. In Q1 is expected the CoreSite team delivered a very strong quarter of new and expansion sales, as these interconnection rich network and cloud dense data center campuses continue to attract strong demand from enterprises to cloud, the network and IT service providers in key U.S. markets.  Looking forward, we expect to continue to see accelerating Hybrid IT and multi-cloud deployments drive increasing demand for a highly interconnected portfolio, which should result in opportunities to selectively deploy capital toward high yield development projects.  Additionally, as the 5G revolution begins to unlock new capabilities, we're beginning to see incremental deployments resulting from AR, VR, gaming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other next generation use cases which require lower latency. We would only expect this trend to accelerate and drive more demand for our data center campuses over the coming years, while pushing storage and compute requirements further out to the network edge.  And when we combine our differentiated data center portfolio, CSP and network operator relationships with our distributed U.S. macro tower portfolio, and long standing MNO partnerships, we believe we have a significantly enhanced option to create value as the edge evolves over the coming years.  In summary, we're more excited than ever for the opportunity to extend on our long track record of strong profitable growth in the U.S. As the 5G environment continues to take shape, we believe we're uniquely positioned to drive continued long-term value for shareholders, while playing a critical role as an industry leader in this evolving 5G landscape.  Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the horrific events unfolding in Ukraine today. It's hard for any of us to comprehend the suffering of those affected by this humanitarian crisis. And while we do not have operations or employees in Ukraine, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those we have lost, and to all those who continue to be subjected to this crisis. We like many global organizations are focused on finding ways to help them millions of people who are suffering, both within the country and those who are now refugees elsewhere. And we will look to join with others to contribute to the relief efforts underway.  With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated 2022 outlook. Rod? Matt, let me start off, and Rod can add in as he see. First of all, within Europe, we're -- first of all, both Telxius as well as our CoreSite acquisition are hitting on all cylinders. They're both outperforming our expectations kind of right out of the gate. And so in Europe, we're very focused on really realizing the full potential with Telxius. As Rod said, we just landed the transaction with 1&1. So our focus is really on the final integration steps with Telxius and really leveraging that capability in the markets that we're in. So we're really pleased with the teams there and the contracts there and the relationship with Telefonica. With regards to CoreSite, they had a record retail and scale quarter. And so we're really pleased with what we've seen there. We've got a terrific management team in place, a good balance between activity between the retail scale and hyperscale types of business. I've got our sights set on building out some of the existing infrastructure that we have available to us. So on both transactions, we couldn't be more pleased with the activity that we're seeing right out of the gate. Yes. Let me -- I'll take the first -- or the second one, Rod, you could take the first one on 1&1. First of all, with regards to the data centers, we're really leveraging what we have acquired at the end of last year. And we're very focused on further developing that business, working very much on just the fundamentals of expanding sales, extending distribution, developing the campuses, market expansion, leveraging the interconnection capabilities that they have. And then secondly, looking at unlocking the opportunities at the edge. And so I think what you will see in the CoreSite transaction, yes, there will be further build-out of existing resources. There are expansions into -- up in Silicon Valley, we have a fairly sizable new asset that we're looking to build up there. And really just trying to, again, unlock the edge and work jointly with both of our customer sets on figuring out how we can play a meaningful role in that development. So the U.S. is our first project in terms of trying to work through all of these opportunities here. We remain really excited about the opportunity there. The kinds of conversations that we're having with the various potential customers are really exciting for us. It's going to take a while for this to unfold. But that's really where our focus is. And so we don't see -- our towers are our business. That's the reason that we did this transaction to begin with, to further develop the revenue that we're going to be able to enjoy at the tower side. And so that's where our focus is going to be. And then on 1&1, Rod? And I guess, Rod, I would just add, we chose not to change the outlook assumptions. So at the time when we issued that initial outlook, we had the equity at that $5 billion level at the price point level. And as I said, just for clarity, I just want to make sure that we just kept at the same going forward. And obviously, we'll adjust that when Rod finally closes this whole transaction, which, again, we would expect in Q2. Sure. Rob, do you want to -- I can... And Ric, I'd just reiterate that I think they're candidly, a very positive event, putting these assets in the hands of Tim Claro and Vivo. And they're very focused on building out further 4G and 5G. So I think this is a real positive for the market. Yes, Brendan, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we are targeting about $150 million of contribution to organic tenant billings growth through colocation and amendment. The metric for the quarter was about $36 million. So that's an acceleration over the exit out of 2021, and it's higher than any quarter we had in 2021. So we are seeing that acceleration in that gross leasing activity in the U.S. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will see a slight pullback in Q2 in that metric, really just around the mechanics of the way the M&As work in the U.S. But when you get to Q3 and Q4, we'll be above the Q1 total here. So we'll be exiting at a higher level going into next year. I don't want to talk about next year too specifically here and give guidance, but we are seeing an acceleration in that metric. We expected to see that, and we are seeing that. And it's all very constructive and kind of in line with our longer-term organic tenant billings growth guidance for the U.S. Yes, thank you Batya. On the continued build-out in the U.S., I mean, yes, there are -- I think the carriers have all said they're interested in continually building out fixed wireless, but that's not getting in the way in terms of their capital spend on really building out 5G. And so we would expect, again, kind of the continued acceleration of that 5G build really accelerating, as Rod said, kind of in the second half of the year. Spectra being cleared and being able to be put in place. We're excited about the prospects for that 5G build. I don't think the carriers are going to let anything get in the way of that opportunity going forward. And on the build side, I just want to say, this is of the last 12 quarters, 11 of them have built over 1,000 new builds. And that's going to contribute significantly to our overall growth rate in '22 as it has in '21. We've laid out a path of looking at north of 40,000 builds over the next several years, and have visibility into contracts with all of our existing customers to do so. Rod mentioned the build that's going on in Africa. We see equally build going on in Europe, clearly in India as well as in Latin America. So we're really excited about the build program. We're looking at over 6,000 new builds in '22. And as I mentioned, I'm hoping that, that will continue to accelerate going forward. Phil, let me just reiterate, As I said all along, the CoreSite capital raise is not impacting how we think at all about future tower opportunities. We'll stop. And let me just -- I can start, and Rod can get it. We're very focused on pricing discipline. I mean the assets that they have and what the business is doing with its own fabric within, we think can support this high single-digit, low double-digit kind of growth rate going forward. And so the team is very focused on extending distribution into all its 3 major pieces, really driving new and expansion sales, working on those renewals, developing the campus and market expansion, leveraging interconnection. So really driving organic growth from existing customers and bring -- getting new business from high-quality new ones and driving new logos within the business. So no change at all in terms of the direction and the discipline that the team brings to the marketplace. We are -- have increased some of the funding to be able to accelerate some of the build-out so that there's more opportunity for growth. But the underlying discipline in terms of how they have approached the business is what we acquired. And we're very excited about continuing that same type of discipline going forward."

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning. And thank you for joining American Tower's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO; and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance. Our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteven Vondran: Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying it's an honor and a privilege to step into the role of CEO at American Tower. I want to thank Tom Bartlett for his leadership over the last 15 years of the company and congratulate him on an exceptional career. I certainly recognize I have big shoes to fill and to all of our stakeholders, I look forward to continuing to build on the tremendous success we've achieved together to date. In recent weeks, I've been telling many of our employees, customers and investors that I'm more excited today by the opportunity ahead that I've been in my 20 plus years with the company. There are two key reasons for that. First, we're still in the early stages of a mobility and computing-driven technology wave that suggests distributed digital infrastructure is going to be a higher demand for the foreseeable future. Second, we spent the last two decades developing a leading global portfolio with real estate, power and interconnection platforms that will serve as the core backbone of this wave. I believe we're now positioned to harvest the benefits of the scaled, differentiated tower and data center platforms we've built to provide unique value for our customers and best-in-class growth, profitability and returns for our investors. To deliver on that opportunity, we're going to be zeroing in on a few key areas in 2024 and beyond. To begin, we're committed to operating the highest quality portfolio. This means owning and investing in assets in the most attractive geographies where secular demand trends signal the potential for long-term sustained growth. Equally, it is important, it means securing business with market leaders, maintaining contract structures that maximize organic growth and minimize downside risks, as well as attracting and securing accretive development opportunities afforded by our in-market scale and leading operational capabilities. We saw the clear benefits of these factors play out in 2023. In our [indiscernible] U.S. and Canada Tower business, the 5G investment cycle and contributions from our comprehensive MLAs drove a record of roughly $230 million in colocation and amendment growth. International performance was also driven by record organic new business growth contribution and further supported by critical CPI-linked escalator terms and growth from our build-to-suit and power as a service programs. Furthermore, our differentiated CoreSite interconnection business saw second consecutive year of record signed new business. Going forward, we're going to continue our focus on maximizing organic growth across our existing assets and complement that incremental revenue generation through select development opportunities. At the same time, we'll continue to actively assess and challenge our prior capital allocation decisions to ensure the opportunity we see ahead across our global footprint is still supportive of our original underwriting thesis and apply what we've learned over the last two decades to our deployment plans going forward. Ultimately, we're focused on operating a portfolio that provides the proper mix of risk exposure and can deliver high quality, sustained top line growth supported by an operating structure that drives outsized rates of conversion to profitability and commands a premium in the market. That's a good segue into the next area of focus, which is delivering the most efficient global operating model centered around cost discipline, margin expansion and increasing returns on invested capital. Our global regional scale and long operating track record present an opportunity to further improve on the operating leverage inherent in the neutral host infrastructure model. We're accelerating initiatives in our regional operations to bring down direct cost per site, we're also investing in experimentation and implementation of AI applications and other technologies that create a more cost and time-efficient equipment deployment cycle bring greater precision and lower cost to our maintenance operations and improved yields on renewable energy generation, just to name a few examples. What it cost our overhead costs, as you'll see in our 2024 guidance, we're targeting a reduction in SG&A, which combined with healthy top line growth is supporting an 80 basis point reduction in cash SG&A as a percentage of property revenue and approximately 200 basis point expansion in cash adjusted EBITDA margin since 2022. Continued improvement to our cost structure and driving profitability is going to be a cornerstone in our both algorithm going forward. Next, and as we've highlighted on past calls, we're working today to further reinforce our balance sheet as a strategic asset. Our investment grade credit rating is at the core of our strategy, and that's not going to change. In fact, I believe market access and cost of capital advantages may be of even more strategic importance in this cycle than they were over the last decade. As Rob will elaborate on further, we made substantial progress towards strengthening the balance sheet in 2023. And as we look to 2024 and beyond, our capital allocation program is going to prioritize resiliency and flexibility in this evolving economic environment. Together with other strategic initiatives like reducing our overall capital intensity of executing on cost savings across the business, we'll hold the dividend relatively flat in 2024, subject to board approval. In turn, we'll prioritize a reduction to our gross debt balance and accelerate the pathway to achieving our net leverage target and enhance financial flexibility. As we've highlighted in the past, while M&A is not a priority today, as a company, we want to be in a position of strength when and if strategically relevant portfolios that meet our investment criteria do come to the market. In our internal CapEx program, we'll continue investing to expand our existing tower and data center platforms by selecting the opportunities with the highest risk-adjusted rates of return. At American Tower, we've developed a unique ability to allocate capital between our U.S. and international tower businesses as well as our U.S. based CoreSite platform. We see this as a distinct competitive advantage. While we continue to view the tower business as the best model out there, the flexibility we're building into our CapEx program and the robust cash flow assets generate allow us to be nimble and responsive to market conditions as we make capital allocation decisions over time, which in the near term means growing our exposure to developed markets. In our outlook for 2024, a larger share of our development capital is going toward the U.S. and Europe including expanding within our CoreSite footprint, where the same demand trends that have resulted in two consecutive years of record new leasing are expected to drive stabilized returns in the mid-teens for ongoing development projects. We're balancing out the expectation to build around 3,000 new tower sites, primarily in our international markets. This does represent a decline in volumes compared to 2022 and 2023, particularly as we assess certain risks in our emerging market footprint, including the FX volatility we've seen recently in Africa. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see partnering with market leaders to grow our tower portfolio globally as a key component of our long-term growth algorithm. Simply put, the changes in the global macroeconomic environment we've seen over the last 24 months and our balance sheet priorities, have raised the bar when it comes to required returns. And you're seeing discipline and flexibility reflected in the capital allocation expectations that we're rolling out for 2024. Finally, and foundational to our strategy are the people throughout the global business. Everything I've talked about today hinge is of the dedication and performance of our teams across the globe and the impact we can make for our customers, investors and the communities we serve. I've been so impressed by the teams I've met with and heard from over recent weeks, and we're going to continue strengthening our organization around the world and focus on developing, attracting and rewarding the best talent in the industry. In closing, I want to reiterate my comments from the outset. I believe there's tremendous opportunity ahead for American Tower. Evolving technology trends continue to drive demand for more ubiquitous, dense, low latency distributed networks. Against those trends, we're going to leverage our leading tower and data center platforms, balance sheet strength, capital allocation discipline and the dedicated teams that are supporting our global business to present a truly differentiated value proposition and compelling growth and return opportunities for shareholders. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our 2023 results and 2024 outlook.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2023 financial results and our expectations for 2024, I will highlight a few key achievements from the past year. First, we closed a successful 2023 with a strong fourth quarter, exceeding our prior outlook midpoints across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO per share with full year 2023 results comfortably beating our initial guidance from a year ago. For the year, performance was anchored by continued demand for our diverse global asset portfolio resulting in over 6% consolidated organic tenant billings growth, an acceleration of over 300 basis points as compared to 2022. With our U.S. & Canada and International segments each delivering record colocation and amendment growth of roughly $230 million in nearly $150 million, respectively. Additionally, we marked another record year of signed new business for CoreSite, supporting digital transformation across diverse workloads in emerging technologies, including more recently, AI use cases. Furthermore, our focus on cost management, combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and certain one-time benefits resulted in attractive year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I'll touch on in a moment. Second, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet through organic deleveraging and the successful issuance of approximately $7 billion in fixed rate debt. As a result of our 2023 actions, we've extended our average maturity and reduced our exposure to floating rate debt to less than 11% of the total debt stack, down from over 22% at the start of the year. Closing the fourth quarter with net leverage of 5.2 times, we are on track to meet the upper end of our 3 times to 5 times net leverage goal by the end of 2024. Finally, we concluded the strategic review of our India business earlier this year, reaching a definitive agreement to sell 100% of ATC India to Brookfield, which we will refer to as the India sale. We believe this transaction together with the Mexico fiber and Poland divestitures in 2023 enhances our global portfolio mix and risk profile and positions American Tower for sustained high quality earnings growth over the long term. Now let's discuss the details of our full year 2023 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was over 5% and nearly 7% on an FX neutral basis, tenant billings growth was 7.2% with organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%, complemented by the construction of nearly 3,200 new builds, primarily in our international markets. In the United States & Canada, property revenue growth was over 4%, with organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% or 6.6% excluding Sprint churn. Our international property revenue grew by over 5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 7.7%, with each segment meeting or exceeding our prior outlook. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we were able to reverse approximately $38 million of prior revenue reserves associated with customer collections in India, contributing to outperformance versus our prior outlook, closing the year with a net revenue reserve associated with customer collections in India of approximately $28 million. Finally, our data center segment contributed approximately $835 million to our total property revenue in 2023, representing year-over-year growth of nearly 9%, and as I mentioned earlier, delivering another record year of signed new business. Moving on. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 7% or around 7.5% on an FX neutral basis to over $7 billion. On a consolidated basis, cash adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 170 basis points year-over-year to 62.3%, primarily driven by strong organic growth and certain one-time benefits combined with a keen focus on cost management throughout the business, with cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down over 30 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7%. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by over 2% and 1%, respectively. Growth on a per share basis absorbed negative impacts of approximately 7% in financing costs and another 1% from FX. Now before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2024, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, and as Steve mentioned, we are committed to owning and operating the highest quality portfolio supported by a strong balance sheet. With that commitment in mind, we are focused on continuing to drive compelling organic growth across our diverse portfolio of assets, while maximizing the conversion of top line growth to profitability by taking costs out of the business. Together with reducing our aggregate capital intensity for the second year in a row and maintaining a relatively flat dividend payout in 2024 as compared to 2023, subject to Board approval, we believe these collective actions will maximize recurring cash flow growth, further strengthen our balance sheet, and as a result, accelerate our pathway to financial flexibility and optionality. We'll get into more detail shortly. Next, we are assuming a full year contribution of the India business in our outlook, representing over $1.16 billion in property revenue, $360 million of adjusted EBITDA and $285 million for unlevered AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders. Upon closing of the India sale, which we anticipate occurring during the second half of 2024, subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval. We will then revise our outlook assumptions to incorporate the transaction. For added transparency, we have included Slide 20 in this earnings presentation, which shows the India contributions to our outlook by quarter, assuming a potential closing on October 1, 2024, for your reference, we would anticipate a reduction of $295 million and $95 million to our presented outlook midpoints for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. Furthermore, we would estimate an approximately $0.09 reduction to attributable AFFO per share, which assumes anticipated proceeds at closing are used to pay down existing indebtedness. Also within the India segment, we have included approximately $65 million in incremental revenue reserves for the full year, translating to a reduction of $0.14 to attributable AFFO per share. Although, we are encouraged by the positive collection results realized in the second half of 2023, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative view at this point in time. Additionally, we've assumed the forward rate curve to support our 2024 interest rate assumptions, including the cost of our floating rate debt and assumptions for refinancing our 2024 senior note maturities. Lastly, on the FX side, our outlook reflects estimated negative translational impacts of $191 million on property revenue, $132 million for adjusted EBITDA and $82 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2023. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving to the details on Slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenue of over $11.1 billion, representing an increase year-over-year of greater than 1% and 3% on an FX neutral basis. Our guide includes cash revenue growth of around $200 million in the U.S. and Canada segment and $225 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions, excluding pass-through. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $80 million of growth in cash revenue in 2024, demonstrating nearly 10% growth year-over-year, excluding the impacts of straight line. Property revenue also includes an approximately $203 million stepdown in non-cash straight line revenue or approximately 2% headwind to growth partially offset by approximately $28 million increase in pass-through. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate an FX headwind of nearly 2% or $191 million to consolidated property revenue growth. Turning to Slide 8. We expect another solid year of organic growth contributions from our U.S. & Canada and International segments. In the U.S. & Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% or 6%, excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes another healthy year of colocation and amendment growth contributions of $180 million to $190 million, reflecting the expected step down from our record level achievement in 2023 though still approximately 20% higher than our 2016 to 2022 average. Internationally, starting with Africa, we expect a strong momentum from 2023 to continue with expected organic tenant billings growth of 11% to 12%. This includes colocation and amendment contributions of approximately 7%, along with escalator growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by churn of around 4%, which would represent a notable year-over-year improvement after incurring the largest impacts from carrier consolidation in 2023. Turning to Europe. 2024 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 5% to 6%. On the colocation and amendment front, we anticipate growth of 3% to 4%, an acceleration as compared to 2023, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 3%, consistent with 2023, churn is expected to remain low at around 1%. In Latin America, consistent with our previous messaging, we expect organic tenant billings growth to stepdown as compared to 2023 to approximately 2% for the year, as churn will remain elevated at around 5%, primarily due to Oi (ph) in Brazil. Churn is offset by relatively consistent colocation and amendment activity of approximately 3% and contributions from escalators of approximately 4%. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we are guiding to approximately 2% organic tenant billings growth in 2024, including colocation and amendment growth of approximately 3.5%, roughly 2.5% from escalators and churn of around 4%. Moving on to Slide 9. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of less than 1% and approximately 2.5% on an FX neutral basis, while absorbing a negative impact of over 3% associated with net straight line. Complementing the strong revenue growth trends I mentioned earlier, we're planning to reduce cash SG&A by approximately $30 million as compared to 2023, contributing to cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of around 30 basis points. Additionally, our outlook includes an expectation for approximately $17 million in year-over-year gross margin growth from our U.S. services business with the quarterly cadence, suggesting a ramp-up in carrier activity in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to grow approximately 5% year-over-year to $10.33 and approximately 6.5% on an FX neutral basis. Growth in cash adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in maintenance CapEx is partially offset by an increase in financing costs and cash taxes, together with higher minority interest adjustments due to growth in our European and data center JVs. Moving on to Slide 11. I'll review our capital plans for 2024 and our balance sheet priorities for the upcoming year. In 2024, we will continue to focus on organic growth, quality of earnings and operational efficiency, while prioritizing balance sheet strength, reducing risk and channel and discretionary spending into capital projects that support sustainable earnings growth and yield the most attractive risk adjusted returns. Consistent with the messaging, on our third quarter 2023 earnings call, the 2024 plan assumes maintaining an annual common dividend distribution of approximately $3 billion, representing a modest increase on an annual per share basis to $6.48 per share. We also expect to evenly distribute the dividend across each quarter of the year, which would suggest a one-time sequential stepdown from our fourth quarter 2023 declared dividend of $1.70 to $1.62 in the first quarter of 2024, all subject to Board approval. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.6 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. As Steve highlighted in his remarks, we view the flexibility of our CapEx deployments with options across a range of geographies and assets to be a distinct competitive advantage for American Tower and our ability to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders. In 2024, this means increasing our CapEx allocation and exposure towards our developed markets. This includes increasing development spend for existing CoreSite data center campuses to $450 million as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and 2023, and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity, while continuing to drive attractive targeted stabilized yields in the mid-teens. The balance of the development CapEx spend will support another year of solid new build volumes internationally, which assumes the construction of 3,000 sites at the midpoint. Moving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet in 2023 through recurring business growth, augmented with cost discipline and combined with the strategic management of our capital allocation plans, we anticipate meeting the upper end of our 3 times to 5 times net leverage range by year-end. Our steadfast commitment to maintaining investment grade credit rating and enhancing our balance sheet strength and financial flexibility remains unchanged. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary, our global business continued to demonstrate solid core growth and resiliency in 2023, augmented by strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our quality of earnings, driving operational efficiency and strengthening our already strong balance sheet. We believe successful execution of these initiatives provides a strong foundation for 2024 and enhances our position as a leader in the global communications infrastructure industry. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities, adapt to challenges and deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders for years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning, and Steve, congrats on the new role and the very best for that. I appreciate the initial comments on your priorities. I wanted to come back to this highest quality portfolio point that you were making. Is there some sort of review process where you're sort of formally going through each of the markets and just looking at what fits and what doesn't and what you want to do about that or is it more kind of investing more in these developed markets? Any color around that? And I'm thinking about markets like Nigeria, where we've obviously had a challenging FX environment here. How do you think about some of those more challenged markets in the near and medium-term? And then you mentioned data center several times in your comments, I know that Rod noted the CapEx was going up here. How are you thinking beyond the existing campuses either domestically or internationally, certainly, a huge opportunity in that business and again, a business where scale really matters? Thanks.\nSteven Vondran: Sure. Well, thanks, Simon. Thanks for the good wishes there. I'll take that in a couple of pieces here. So I'll start out with what do we mean by the highest quality portfolio. And what we mean by that is, we're constantly reassessing all of our portfolios, both domestically and abroad and rechallenging all the decisions we made about capital allocation in the past and say, do they still meet our investment criteria. And if there's a challenge in the business, our first choice is to say what can we do to fix that? How can we get it to meet those criteria? And then the second thing, we would look at is ongoing capital allocation and is it a market or a business we want to continue to put capital into. So when we talk about the best quality portfolio, what we're saying is that we continue to look at that we found our assumptions there, and I did mention in my comments that if you look at a market like Nigeria, the macroeconomic conditions, including some of the FX translation issues have caused us to raise the bar in terms of acquired returns. So when we talk about that portfolio, we're looking at the market, the asset class, the demand for the assets, the contract structures we have in place, what types of contractual protections we can get for something like an FX devaluation, and we're shaping the portfolio for that. Now having said that, there's nothing to report beyond what we've already talked about in terms of the strategic review we did in India. We've been very clear that we're going to exit that market. We did exit Poland because it wasn't to scale for us and we did choose to exit Mexico fiber. And we'll continue to look at those other businesses that we have and make assessments on those. But there's nothing I would point to today to say that we're going to make any portfolio changes in the near term. The second question, I think you asked was how do we think about a market like Nigeria, and we believe that the emerging market portfolio is still an important part of our growth algorithm going forward. And we think that having the appropriate level of risk there to complement our developed market strategy will continue to allow us to elongate our growth curve over time there. We are mindful that there are some near-term challenges that we're seeing there. And you're seeing that play out some of our capital allocation decisions as we're rotating some of our discretionary CapEx for developed markets versus the emerging markets. You've also seen that play out in recent years with some of the inorganic acquisitions we've done. We did inside in the U.S., CoreSite in the U.S., Telsius in Europe. And those all had the effect of reducing our emerging market exposure, divesting India will reduce our emerging market exposure if we continue to allocate more of our development CapEx to developed markets versus emerging markets, that will also decrease our margin market exposure. So what you're essentially seeing play out there is us rebalancing our portfolio a little bit in response to the macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing, which we think is the appropriate thing to do in any environment is to look at the portfolio and rebalance it. And so that leads back into that highest quality portfolio. The second question I think you had was around CoreSite and what are we focused on there? Right now, most of our development CapEx is focused on expanding our existing campuses. And if you look at how that business has performed, we've had two years of record leasing, and we need to replenish the capacity that we have sold in those campuses. And it's a very good use of our capital. Again, we're looking at stabilized returns in the mid-teens. And if you think about the projects we have in our development, they're more than 40% pre-leased as of the end of the year. And so when you think about that business, pre-leasing is something that wasn't as prevalent in CoreSite pre-acquisition and that pre-leasing really reduces the risk of all that development, and it shortens the time period that it takes to get to those stabilized mid-teens returns. And so that's why you're seeing us pick up the investment there a bit. We do evaluate some Tier 2 markets in the U.S. You saw us buy a small data center in Miami, and we'll continue to look at whether there are sort of tuck-ins that we might want to do in the U.S. if we have an anchor tenant that's going to give us a good return going into it. And if we think it can turn into a more material campus for us later on. But it's not a huge priority for us. You're not going to see us put a lot of capital into that. And with respect to international expansion in data centers, that's not something we're leaning into at this point. We do have customers that would love for us to have a larger footprint than we do today. And we'll consider those opportunities. But there's nothing that I would point to today to say that we're going to do anything outside the U.S. in the near term?\nSimon Flannery: Right.\nRod Smith: Hey, Simon. Maybe I would complement Steve's comments on Nigeria just briefly here. But just as a reminder, I know you know this, but for others in Nigeria, we also look to protect ourselves in the contract structures that Steve mentioned. So just as a reminder, we've got about $400 million in revenue, property revenue in Nigeria. 40% of that is actually passed through. Much of that is power, which is pegged to U.S. pricing. So we avoid the FX risk on those pass-through numbers. 60% of that $400 million roughly is the is the leasing revenue and 50% of that adjusts annually pegged to the U.S. dollar. So again, that's protected or sheltered from the FX volatility. That leaves about 30% of the revenue in Nigeria that's actually directly exposed to the FX fluctuations. And then with that said, of course, we build the Fisher effect into our models. We look for risk adjusted rates of returns, although in the short term, FX can be volatile, we do think our underwriting process catches the FX volatility that would be in a market like Nigeria and others over the long term.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good morning and congrats again, Steve, on the official transition. Two topics for you this morning. First, can you share an update on the domestic leasing environment as to whether or not you're seeing any changes in the activity levels early this year? And can you share some of the data points and development that are contributing to the decision to include improving carrier activity during the second half within your services guidance? And then just a second topic, what is the road map for the LatAm portfolio to normalize its level of organic growth? How long does it take to get there and what is that level of organic growth that AMT can return to? Thanks.\nSteven Vondran: Thanks, Michael. Thanks for the well wishes there. So I'll start with your first question about the U.S. So we are predicting our guidance for OTBG in the U.S. is approximately 4.7%. And as you know, that's underwritten largely by our comprehensive MLAs that we have with our carriers. So we have a degree of insulation from the variability that you see in the deployment cadence there. We do have one of our big three carrier MLAs that has rolled off of its comprehensive portion of that MLA. And so that's gone to a little bit more of an a [indiscernible]. So you'll see that activity spread more through unloaded like it would have been in a comprehensive agreement. What we're seeing from the carriers in the U.S. is we are seeing an uptick in the conversations around activity. We've seen a modest increase in application levels already this year that's off to a pretty low base at the end of last year, but we are seeing some increase in activity. But before we get the applications, there's a degree of conversation, an inquiry that happens with our carriers. And especially with respect to our services business, we have a lot of conversation around that. And we're engaged on the front end of the process when they're doing their RF design sheets and trying to figure out what they're going to do for the year. And that's what's led us to believe that there's an uptick in activity, probably back-end loaded, and that's led to our increasing our guidance and our services business for next year. Now I would point out that if you look at our services guide, it's a little bit lower margin than previously. That's a result of having a little bit more construction services in that guide. And I do want to point out our construction business. That's something that we've not grown aggressively over the past. And when you think about that services business, we don't do that nationwide. We do it in pockets where we have the right resources and can you lean on third-party contractors to do the work. So if there are variabilities in the demand that we see there that we can cut our costs pretty quickly there. So that's one of the things we're seeing reflected in that services margin is a higher mix of construction services. But again, that's targeted by region, by carrier and it's not a huge business for us, but it's 1 that we think adds value to our customers, and it earns us a little bit more business.\nMichael Rollins: Yeah.\nRod Smith: Michael, I'll hit the LatAm question on the organic tenant billings. So let me just kind of recap a little bit where we're at. Our guide for 2024 is about 2% organic tenant billings growth. That comes with a pretty steady colocation and amendment level of activity of around 3%. We also are benefiting from the escalators that are tied to local inflation across the region, that's at about 4%. So you have that gross growth coming in, in the upper single digits, 7%. We do also have 5% churn in for 2024. We've had a couple of churn events that we've worked through in Latin America over the last couple of years. Noticeably in 2023, we worked through the Telefonica churn down in Mexico. I think you're well aware of that. One of the primary drivers of the churn in 2024 is the Oi churn in Brazil. So of that 5% churn, almost half of it is the Oi churn that we're assuming is going to come through in 2024, that's about $26 million of tenant billings for Oi that ends up coming off in 2024. So we look at the market there. And yes, we've gone through some consolidation churn. And that churn is really what's been reducing our overall organic tenant billings growth rate. We do expect to get through that churn and return to more normalized growth in the mid to upper mid-single digits but it's probably going to be a few years away before we get through that in the event, not that I want to talk too much about '25 and beyond, but the Oi churn will persist for a couple of more years. That's the one sort of to watch and to see how it rolls through. But once we get through that, we do see a good steady level of colocation amendment activity and the way our contracts are written. We do benefit from the escalations tied to inflation. We protect ourselves from some FX volatility as well.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess, two, if I could. First, maybe just Steve, I think the biggest question I'm getting is that what we're hearing from American Tower about maybe a better second half of visibility into higher activity levels into the second half of the year is different than maybe what we heard yesterday from one of your peers, which is that the year is going to be more front-end loaded that the back part of the year could be slower than the jumping off point for 2024 and the 2025 might be slower. So could you kind of maybe talk a little bit about your conviction level that the second half activity levels can be higher, maybe some of the differences between some of the MLAs you might have that others don't DISH relationships, etc., that would be very helpful, I think, for people to kind of reconcile what we're hearing in the last couple of days. And then the second question, Rod. Thank you for all the details around India. I think some people, I think, were surprised to see India in the full year guide, and people are trying to back out that one quarter in the back part of the year. Slide 20, you have an unlevered number that gets you to around $0.15, $0.16 per share. But in the text, you've got a number that you're pulling out for about $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter. Could you help us understand the difference between the unlevered and the levered numbers that in order to kind of get a level set for what we are really thinking will be the guide for 2024 AFFO per share. Thank you.\nSteven Vondran: Okay. I'll start with the first question, and talk about the U.S. growth. So I would just point out that as a result of our comprehensive MLAs that our revenue is decoupled from the levels of activity to some extent. So I think comparing us to someone else's estimations of leasing new business is a little bit tough, just given the fact that we have a level of locked-in activity. And a large part of our rental growth is, it's locked in, it's either signed because it was signed last year, it's commencing this year. It's part of our comprehensive MLAs or there's a degree of carryover revenue and the OTBG number carries forward because the trailing 12-month metric there. The better analog for activity is our services business. And as we've said in the past, it's notoriously hard to predict exactly where you're going to land. A couple of years ago, we had to take guidance up quite a bit. Last year, we brought it down. So what we're providing here is, our best estimate given the levels of activity we're seeing, but also some of it can be more market-driven. So it may be activity in a particular market versus more ubiquitous activity, given that that's how we're performing some of that service has worked. We do see a general uptick in conversation from our customers that make us believe that there will be an uptick in the second half of the year. But as you think about that activity and the service levels of the -- service business with that activity, you have to do quite a bit of services work before you actually sign a new lease, if you're driving an a la carte environment. So it could just be timing that we're referencing there. But at the end of the day, our belief is, our property revenue growth or rental growth is largely locked in, and we feel confident in the portion that's not locked in, but that will come through in the cadence, we believe. And on the services side, we believe that we'll see a continuing ramp in that activity and that's what led to the guide on that.\nRod Smith: Hey, David. Rod here. Regarding India, just a couple of points there. So you see in Page 20, we give you the breakdown for India, not just for the full year, but also on a quarterly basis so that to really help you figure out kind of what the impact may be up against a variety of closing dates, right? We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2024. And the process that we're going through is it's being reviewed by the Competition Commission in India. So that's kind of the gating action there. And of course, we reviewed kind of that process with local -- with our local team, with local advisers, lawyers in India based, lawyers in the U.S. and as well as doing the proper diligence around interested parties within India, and we feel pretty good about that approval process. With all that said, we do expect it to be approved and closed in the second half of the year, but we're not exactly sure what the date would be. So we wanted to give you the quarterly breakdown so that as we progress through the year, you'd have the ability to kind of look at it quarter-by-quarter. On a full year, we've got property revenue from India at about 1.2 -- just under $1.2 billion adjusted EBITDA at about $360 million. And unlevered AFFO at $285 million and again, you can see the way that breaks down per quarter. Essentially, the difference between that unlevered AFFO and what we look at is the potential dilution of $0.30 to $0.40 for the year, maybe $0.09 dilution on a quarterly basis is the assumption that we would take the proceeds from the sale, roughly the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in pay down revolving debt that is in the -- not that I want to give you the guide in terms of our interest rate, but you can kind of know where revolving debt is these days for us up in the 6% range or so, approximately. You put that -- those proceeds towards paying down that debt, and that's the differential that brings that dilution down into the $0.09 per quarter or between $0.30 and $0.40 for the year. The math is really that simple, David.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. That\u2019s really helpful, guys. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRichard Prentiss: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve, I appreciate you giving us your view and the refinement raising the capital allocation by all good details. First question I've got is, Rod, piggybacking on David's question about India. There is obviously some concentration there at Brookfield as far as how many towers they have in the marketplace. Have you heard anything from the competitive commission there about their comfort level or would there be any required divestitures?\nRod Smith: Yeah, Rick. Thanks for the question. So we're working through the process. I don't want to get into detailed discussions. We certainly haven't talked directly to the Competition Commission, but we've certainly done a fair amount of diligence. We're not sure where that will end up. We're pretty confident, very confident it gets approved. There could be some level of divestitures that was contemplated within the agreement that we work through. So nothing there that would concern us overly. And the other part is where Brookfield does have some towers the way they plan to run these also is competition friendly, I would say is the way that we kind of we view it there. So I don't want to go into more detail than that, but we do expect that the transaction would be approved and would have the ability to close it in the second half of 2024.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And then Steve, I appreciate the comments that you decouple service revenue really from leasing revenue because of the analyses versus others. Is it still kind of three, six months from the time you're getting applications having these talks before it shows up in the financials? And then can you give us a little color kind of then on the pacing you expect of that. I think, Rod, you said $180 million to $190 million of new leasing activity in U.S., Canada.\nSteven Vondran: Sure. It's hard to give an exact time line, Rick, because it's different by different customers. So I would say from application to revenue showing up on an a la carte basis, there's a variability there from call it, 60 days to six months kind of what you referred to there. It really depends on the customer and how urgent they are to get on the site, to be honest with you. In terms of the cadence for the contribution from the new leases and colocation, it's relatively flat across the period. Again, I just would point out that we had the comprehensive portion of 1 of our major MLAs expired at the end of last year. And so that got rid of some of the front-end loading that you saw in previous years. So it will be more evenly distributed this year.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And the last one, Rod, you cited out that there's a probability that the dividend could go down from the $1.70 paid in the fourth quarter to what would be paid evenly spread over 24 or maybe $1.62, while keeping it fairly flat '24 versus '23 annually. Help people understand, what was the thought process on why raise the dividend because we get this question a lot, why raise the dividend so much in 4Q '23 if you have to pull it optically down in 1Q '24, while keeping that flat for the year.\nSteven Vondran: Yeah. Rick, I'll take that one. Look, we didn't take the decision to hold the dividend flat lightly on that, and we were aware of the optics problem with a step down from Q4 to Q1. But we had committed to our shareholders to a certain dividend in 2023 and when we decided to hold it flat in 2024. If we didn't have the step up in Q4, then we would have -- then we wouldn't have hit the number that we had committed to. And so we like to do what we say we're going to do, and that's the reason we kept it there. And we think this has been very well telegraphed. We're trying to be very clear on our Q3 call about what was happening, and we've talked about it since then. And this is a one-time event. And so agree that it wasn't -- it's not the ideal situation, but we wanted to do what we say we're going to do and handle the dividend flat.\nRichard Prentiss: We always like executives doing what they say they're going to do. And I do think going spread evenly through the year is probably good as well. So thanks, guys and Steve, appreciate all the color is very insightful about how you're sitting in the seat on running the company. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: I appreciate the question. Steve, so you made it pretty clear deleveraging and investing in kind of more developed markets this year is a top priority. So maybe you could talk about the M&A environment right now as a potential use of capital? I know there are some consolidation opportunities out there in Europe. Just wondering if that's an area of expansion for you over time? And then one for Rod, I think you've talked aspirationally about getting to kind of a double-digit AFFO growth rate. Maybe you could just kind of update us longer term with the impact of refinancings in the coming years, the India transaction, where do you think you can get to when stripping out some of the noise from India and some of the changes in interest rates that we've seen recently? Thank you.\nSteven Vondran: So I'll start talking about the M&A environment. Look, we continue to monitor what's going on in the M&A activity across the portfolio. We're still seeing a dislocation between public and private multiples. And so there's no portfolio out there today that's trading that we think is strategically important that would meet our investment criteria. And that's one of the reasons that we're a little bit out of that market right now. One of the reasons that we're very focused on bringing our leverage down to the high end of our target range is to make sure that we're in a position to take advantage of inorganic opportunities when and if they come to market that we think are strategically important, but also to meet our investment criteria. So we're optimistic that there will be portfolios in the future that are something that we would be interested in. But right now, there's just nothing that I would point to you that we think is, is trading in a range that we would find compelling.\nRod Smith: Hey, Eric. Rod here. Thanks for the question. So regarding AFFO growth, let me just hit a couple of points. First, I'll just hit kind of generically what we look at as kind of a growth algorithm for the portfolio. And as Steve said, we're really pleased with the portfolio that we have the diversity that we have throughout developed markets as well as exposure to emerging markets. I would remind you and everyone that in those emerging markets, those are some of the largest populated industries in the world that need more and more infrastructure over time. And we do think having exposure to that is going to be really good for us and our investors in this growth algorithm. But the algorithm is really pretty straightforward. We look at it roughly 5% organic growth from the U.S. That includes some Sprint churn over the next few years there. We do expect that the non-U.S. properties will have incremental growth from there, maybe a couple of hundred basis points. And we think that's possible, certainly from Africa and Latin America over time, maybe not every year, but on average over a long period of time, which we expect to be there. We're looking at upper single-digit, double-digit growth rates from CoreSite with very nice returns. So that looks very good. And of course, as you move down the P&L, you end up with higher growth rates at gross margin and EBITDA margin, particularly with our focus on cost discipline reducing cost, managing costs, both direct costs as well as SG&A and driving expanded margins. So by the time you get down to AFFO, does that 5% U.S. growth, 7% international, double-digit CoreSite, all that can translate into upper single-digit AFFO growth pretty nicely. That's kind of what we look at. And then if you just look at 2023 and in 2024, in '23, we came in AFFO per share growth at around 1% or so. I'll just remind you that included 7% headwind from financing in the year. It included an additional 100 basis point headwind for the VIL reserve and maybe a full percentage point for FX. If you kind of do the math backwards, that core underlying business is solidly upper single-digit growth rate. In 2024, the guide is around 5%, getting us to that $10.33 per share. Financing headwinds in that is about 100 basis points. We have the reserve, broadly speaking, for India, and that's about a 100 basis point headwind as well. And with the FX volatility that we're seeing, and that's about a 200 basis point headwind again, you back up into that and you're getting into that upper single-digit kind of core growth. And I'll remind you that, that -- even that upper single-digit core growth has embedded in it higher-than-normal churn in some of the emerging markets as well as the Sprint churn in the U.S. As we go through that, being able to handle some modest FX and even financing items with churn being at a more normal level, certainly in the upper single-digit growth rates on AFFO and AFFO per share is in our line of sight.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations for Europe in terms of new leasing revenue growth beyond this year and how you think about your scale in the region? And I think there was a bit of a write-down in Spain, can you talk about what drove that? Thank you.\nSteven Vondran: I'll start with some leasing trends, Rod you can pick it up. So what we're seeing in Europe is we continue to see build-outs by the carriers. And we do see substantial 5G population coverage from the leading MNOs in Germany and Spain. So the pipeline of growth that we see remains solid, but it's more weighted toward colocations. In Germany, we are continuing to work through some of the market complexities that everyone's dealing with there, including some permitting delays and time for power connections. But we do feel good about the progress we've made there. We've brought in resources from other parts of our company to help with that and kind of utilizing best practices. So we do expect some improvement in our time lines there. So that's what we would expect to continue to see in Europe. There's a little bit more colocation driven activity and they're through the bulk of their 5G upgrades in most of our markets.\nRod Smith: Hey, Batya. Rod here. So regarding Spain, you obviously saw that we had a write-down in our Spain market of about $80 million, that is exclusively rate driven based on the cost of capital as a function of our annual impairment testing. And I would also add to that, that the Spain market is performing very well in terms of hitting its metrics and milestones up against our original business case. I'd also remind you that the Spain business was really the only business in Europe that is 100% from the Telsius acquisition. There was no legacy business there prior to that transaction. But simply put, the impairment of about $80 million was exclusively a function of rising cost of capital running through a discounted cash flow impairment model.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just one on data centers and one housekeeping. First, on data centers, how are the nature of conversations with your customers changing or evolving if at all, as AI use cases become a little bit more pervasive across enterprises. And I'm really getting at, do you sense that, that sort of edge data center builds that maybe was part of the CoreSite acquisition maybe rationale at least initially, the micro data centers at the basis of your towers, is that becoming something that's a little bit more near term or is that more still of a long-term opportunity? And then maybe for Rod, on D&A, what's driving the review and the decision to potentially extend the useful lives of the tower assets? I saw a pretty big step down implied in D&A and your guide for this year? Thanks.\nSteven Vondran: So I'll start with the data center question. In general, with CoreSite, what we're seeing is demand is still largely driven by enterprises moving to hybrid cloud environment. And that's people who either or either cloud native or primarily cloud or they were still in their on-prem facility, that's still a major driver. We are seeing AI inferencing pick up in our facilities. We've always had some AI applications that we're targeting our facilities. So we are seeing demand there. More broadly speaking, AI is reducing overall capacity in the market or overall supply of the markets, which is leading to some favorable pricing trends for us. When it comes to the Edge deployment, we do think that AI inferencing in particular, in the interface people have with AI will lead to opportunities there. Right now, the near-term opportunities that we're exploring are more niche markets. You may have seen one of our partners put out a blog that we're working with them on an Edge facility kind of in the automotive market to update software on their products. We have a number of POCs that we're working on with various partners that are more niche applications in particular. I think the micro data centers at the base of the towers, facilitating AI is still a little bit further out. And we'll continue to update you guys if there's something to talk about there. But in the meantime, we just continue to work with our customers or potential customers on iterating on what that's going to look like.\nRod Smith: Hey, Matt. Regarding the tower life adjustment that you saw running through our numbers here, we essentially increased the tower life from 20 years to 30 years for book purposes for our GAAP books. And that was simply put, it\u2019s just a function of matching up the book life here more closely with what the actual realized life is for the assets. So nothing really more complicated than that other than a realization that these assets last a lot longer than 20 years. So our books will not reflect that going forward.\nMatthew Niknam: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Hey. Thank you for taking the question. So when we look at the capital spending to the data center segment and your development pipeline, does that imply your development pipeline -- with your development pipeline, does that imply capital spending expansion beyond 2024, really, how does that inform your decision on spending around your remaining businesses in your tower segments? Thanks.\nSteven Vondran: Sure. Well, the record amount of sales that we've had is what's led to increasing the development pipeline there. And it really depends on what our sales are this year and how we continue to see the opportunities in that portfolio evolve as to what the future spending are. So it would be premature for me to kind of guide future years' capital there. What I would reinforce is that we have a degree of optionality in our capital spending and that we do have a structure with CoreSite where we also have partners in that business. And so there is some optionality in terms of how much capital we put in, and you could see us using our capital or somebody else's capital to expand if we thought that was a better option for us. But at this point, the development pipeline we have today, we're choosing to sell fine because we're achieving mid-teens stabilized returns, very low risk in our existing campuses, and we continue to see demand rise. So we'll make that assessment into what's appropriate for 2025 and later a little bit later, and we'll share that with you guys at the appropriate time.\nRod Smith: Hey, Brandon. Rod here. The only thing I would add to Steve's comments there is that we have full optionality kind of going forward. I think Steve alluded to this, but going beyond 2024 the fact that we're investing $450 million in the data center business in 2024 does not commit us to that level or a higher level of capital spending in that business going forward. So we have a fair amount of flexibility to deploy capital towards towers, towards data centers, towards towers in developed markets, emerging markets, certain countries, not other countries as we go year-to-year. So we will be looking to secure that optionality, protect that optionality so we can always make decisions with our capital that follow the best risk-adjusted rates of return around the globe for any given year.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thank you.\nAdam Smith: Thank you, everybody for joining today's call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2023 financial results and our expectations for 2024, I will highlight a few key achievements from the past year. First, we closed a successful 2023 with a strong fourth quarter, exceeding our prior outlook midpoints across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO per share with full year 2023 results comfortably beating our initial guidance from a year ago. For the year, performance was anchored by continued demand for our diverse global asset portfolio resulting in over 6% consolidated organic tenant billings growth, an acceleration of over 300 basis points as compared to 2022. With our U.S. & Canada and International segments each delivering record colocation and amendment growth of roughly $230 million in nearly $150 million, respectively. Additionally, we marked another record year of signed new business for CoreSite, supporting digital transformation across diverse workloads in emerging technologies, including more recently, AI use cases. Furthermore, our focus on cost management, combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and certain one-time benefits resulted in attractive year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I'll touch on in a moment. Second, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet through organic deleveraging and the successful issuance of approximately $7 billion in fixed rate debt. As a result of our 2023 actions, we've extended our average maturity and reduced our exposure to floating rate debt to less than 11% of the total debt stack, down from over 22% at the start of the year. Closing the fourth quarter with net leverage of 5.2 times, we are on track to meet the upper end of our 3 times to 5 times net leverage goal by the end of 2024. Finally, we concluded the strategic review of our India business earlier this year, reaching a definitive agreement to sell 100% of ATC India to Brookfield, which we will refer to as the India sale. We believe this transaction together with the Mexico fiber and Poland divestitures in 2023 enhances our global portfolio mix and risk profile and positions American Tower for sustained high quality earnings growth over the long term. Now let's discuss the details of our full year 2023 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was over 5% and nearly 7% on an FX neutral basis, tenant billings growth was 7.2% with organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%, complemented by the construction of nearly 3,200 new builds, primarily in our international markets. In the United States & Canada, property revenue growth was over 4%, with organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% or 6.6% excluding Sprint churn. Our international property revenue grew by over 5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 7.7%, with each segment meeting or exceeding our prior outlook. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we were able to reverse approximately $38 million of prior revenue reserves associated with customer collections in India, contributing to outperformance versus our prior outlook, closing the year with a net revenue reserve associated with customer collections in India of approximately $28 million. Finally, our data center segment contributed approximately $835 million to our total property revenue in 2023, representing year-over-year growth of nearly 9%, and as I mentioned earlier, delivering another record year of signed new business. Moving on. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 7% or around 7.5% on an FX neutral basis to over $7 billion. On a consolidated basis, cash adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 170 basis points year-over-year to 62.3%, primarily driven by strong organic growth and certain one-time benefits combined with a keen focus on cost management throughout the business, with cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down over 30 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7%. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by over 2% and 1%, respectively. Growth on a per share basis absorbed negative impacts of approximately 7% in financing costs and another 1% from FX. Now before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2024, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, and as Steve mentioned, we are committed to owning and operating the highest quality portfolio supported by a strong balance sheet. With that commitment in mind, we are focused on continuing to drive compelling organic growth across our diverse portfolio of assets, while maximizing the conversion of top line growth to profitability by taking costs out of the business. Together with reducing our aggregate capital intensity for the second year in a row and maintaining a relatively flat dividend payout in 2024 as compared to 2023, subject to Board approval, we believe these collective actions will maximize recurring cash flow growth, further strengthen our balance sheet, and as a result, accelerate our pathway to financial flexibility and optionality. We'll get into more detail shortly. Next, we are assuming a full year contribution of the India business in our outlook, representing over $1.16 billion in property revenue, $360 million of adjusted EBITDA and $285 million for unlevered AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders. Upon closing of the India sale, which we anticipate occurring during the second half of 2024, subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval. We will then revise our outlook assumptions to incorporate the transaction. For added transparency, we have included Slide 20 in this earnings presentation, which shows the India contributions to our outlook by quarter, assuming a potential closing on October 1, 2024, for your reference, we would anticipate a reduction of $295 million and $95 million to our presented outlook midpoints for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. Furthermore, we would estimate an approximately $0.09 reduction to attributable AFFO per share, which assumes anticipated proceeds at closing are used to pay down existing indebtedness. Also within the India segment, we have included approximately $65 million in incremental revenue reserves for the full year, translating to a reduction of $0.14 to attributable AFFO per share. Although, we are encouraged by the positive collection results realized in the second half of 2023, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative view at this point in time. Additionally, we've assumed the forward rate curve to support our 2024 interest rate assumptions, including the cost of our floating rate debt and assumptions for refinancing our 2024 senior note maturities. Lastly, on the FX side, our outlook reflects estimated negative translational impacts of $191 million on property revenue, $132 million for adjusted EBITDA and $82 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2023. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving to the details on Slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenue of over $11.1 billion, representing an increase year-over-year of greater than 1% and 3% on an FX neutral basis. Our guide includes cash revenue growth of around $200 million in the U.S. and Canada segment and $225 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions, excluding pass-through. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $80 million of growth in cash revenue in 2024, demonstrating nearly 10% growth year-over-year, excluding the impacts of straight line. Property revenue also includes an approximately $203 million stepdown in non-cash straight line revenue or approximately 2% headwind to growth partially offset by approximately $28 million increase in pass-through. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate an FX headwind of nearly 2% or $191 million to consolidated property revenue growth. Turning to Slide 8. We expect another solid year of organic growth contributions from our U.S. & Canada and International segments. In the U.S. & Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% or 6%, excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes another healthy year of colocation and amendment growth contributions of $180 million to $190 million, reflecting the expected step down from our record level achievement in 2023 though still approximately 20% higher than our 2016 to 2022 average. Internationally, starting with Africa, we expect a strong momentum from 2023 to continue with expected organic tenant billings growth of 11% to 12%. This includes colocation and amendment contributions of approximately 7%, along with escalator growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by churn of around 4%, which would represent a notable year-over-year improvement after incurring the largest impacts from carrier consolidation in 2023. Turning to Europe. 2024 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 5% to 6%. On the colocation and amendment front, we anticipate growth of 3% to 4%, an acceleration as compared to 2023, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 3%, consistent with 2023, churn is expected to remain low at around 1%. In Latin America, consistent with our previous messaging, we expect organic tenant billings growth to stepdown as compared to 2023 to approximately 2% for the year, as churn will remain elevated at around 5%, primarily due to Oi (ph) in Brazil. Churn is offset by relatively consistent colocation and amendment activity of approximately 3% and contributions from escalators of approximately 4%. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we are guiding to approximately 2% organic tenant billings growth in 2024, including colocation and amendment growth of approximately 3.5%, roughly 2.5% from escalators and churn of around 4%. Moving on to Slide 9. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of less than 1% and approximately 2.5% on an FX neutral basis, while absorbing a negative impact of over 3% associated with net straight line. Complementing the strong revenue growth trends I mentioned earlier, we're planning to reduce cash SG&A by approximately $30 million as compared to 2023, contributing to cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of around 30 basis points. Additionally, our outlook includes an expectation for approximately $17 million in year-over-year gross margin growth from our U.S. services business with the quarterly cadence, suggesting a ramp-up in carrier activity in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to grow approximately 5% year-over-year to $10.33 and approximately 6.5% on an FX neutral basis. Growth in cash adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in maintenance CapEx is partially offset by an increase in financing costs and cash taxes, together with higher minority interest adjustments due to growth in our European and data center JVs. Moving on to Slide 11. I'll review our capital plans for 2024 and our balance sheet priorities for the upcoming year. In 2024, we will continue to focus on organic growth, quality of earnings and operational efficiency, while prioritizing balance sheet strength, reducing risk and channel and discretionary spending into capital projects that support sustainable earnings growth and yield the most attractive risk adjusted returns. Consistent with the messaging, on our third quarter 2023 earnings call, the 2024 plan assumes maintaining an annual common dividend distribution of approximately $3 billion, representing a modest increase on an annual per share basis to $6.48 per share. We also expect to evenly distribute the dividend across each quarter of the year, which would suggest a one-time sequential stepdown from our fourth quarter 2023 declared dividend of $1.70 to $1.62 in the first quarter of 2024, all subject to Board approval. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.6 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. As Steve highlighted in his remarks, we view the flexibility of our CapEx deployments with options across a range of geographies and assets to be a distinct competitive advantage for American Tower and our ability to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders. In 2024, this means increasing our CapEx allocation and exposure towards our developed markets. This includes increasing development spend for existing CoreSite data center campuses to $450 million as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and 2023, and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity, while continuing to drive attractive targeted stabilized yields in the mid-teens. The balance of the development CapEx spend will support another year of solid new build volumes internationally, which assumes the construction of 3,000 sites at the midpoint. Moving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet in 2023 through recurring business growth, augmented with cost discipline and combined with the strategic management of our capital allocation plans, we anticipate meeting the upper end of our 3 times to 5 times net leverage range by year-end. Our steadfast commitment to maintaining investment grade credit rating and enhancing our balance sheet strength and financial flexibility remains unchanged. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary, our global business continued to demonstrate solid core growth and resiliency in 2023, augmented by strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our quality of earnings, driving operational efficiency and strengthening our already strong balance sheet. We believe successful execution of these initiatives provides a strong foundation for 2024 and enhances our position as a leader in the global communications infrastructure industry. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities, adapt to challenges and deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders for years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions. Hey, Simon. Maybe I would complement Steve's comments on Nigeria just briefly here. But just as a reminder, I know you know this, but for others in Nigeria, we also look to protect ourselves in the contract structures that Steve mentioned. So just as a reminder, we've got about $400 million in revenue, property revenue in Nigeria. 40% of that is actually passed through. Much of that is power, which is pegged to U.S. pricing. So we avoid the FX risk on those pass-through numbers. 60% of that $400 million roughly is the is the leasing revenue and 50% of that adjusts annually pegged to the U.S. dollar. So again, that's protected or sheltered from the FX volatility. That leaves about 30% of the revenue in Nigeria that's actually directly exposed to the FX fluctuations. And then with that said, of course, we build the Fisher effect into our models. We look for risk adjusted rates of returns, although in the short term, FX can be volatile, we do think our underwriting process catches the FX volatility that would be in a market like Nigeria and others over the long term. Michael, I'll hit the LatAm question on the organic tenant billings. So let me just kind of recap a little bit where we're at. Our guide for 2024 is about 2% organic tenant billings growth. That comes with a pretty steady colocation and amendment level of activity of around 3%. We also are benefiting from the escalators that are tied to local inflation across the region, that's at about 4%. So you have that gross growth coming in, in the upper single digits, 7%. We do also have 5% churn in for 2024. We've had a couple of churn events that we've worked through in Latin America over the last couple of years. Noticeably in 2023, we worked through the Telefonica churn down in Mexico. I think you're well aware of that. One of the primary drivers of the churn in 2024 is the Oi churn in Brazil. So of that 5% churn, almost half of it is the Oi churn that we're assuming is going to come through in 2024, that's about $26 million of tenant billings for Oi that ends up coming off in 2024. So we look at the market there. And yes, we've gone through some consolidation churn. And that churn is really what's been reducing our overall organic tenant billings growth rate. We do expect to get through that churn and return to more normalized growth in the mid to upper mid-single digits but it's probably going to be a few years away before we get through that in the event, not that I want to talk too much about '25 and beyond, but the Oi churn will persist for a couple of more years. That's the one sort of to watch and to see how it rolls through. But once we get through that, we do see a good steady level of colocation amendment activity and the way our contracts are written. We do benefit from the escalations tied to inflation. We protect ourselves from some FX volatility as well. Hey, David. Rod here. Regarding India, just a couple of points there. So you see in Page 20, we give you the breakdown for India, not just for the full year, but also on a quarterly basis so that to really help you figure out kind of what the impact may be up against a variety of closing dates, right? We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2024. And the process that we're going through is it's being reviewed by the Competition Commission in India. So that's kind of the gating action there. And of course, we reviewed kind of that process with local -- with our local team, with local advisers, lawyers in India based, lawyers in the U.S. and as well as doing the proper diligence around interested parties within India, and we feel pretty good about that approval process. With all that said, we do expect it to be approved and closed in the second half of the year, but we're not exactly sure what the date would be. So we wanted to give you the quarterly breakdown so that as we progress through the year, you'd have the ability to kind of look at it quarter-by-quarter. On a full year, we've got property revenue from India at about 1.2 -- just under $1.2 billion adjusted EBITDA at about $360 million. And unlevered AFFO at $285 million and again, you can see the way that breaks down per quarter. Essentially, the difference between that unlevered AFFO and what we look at is the potential dilution of $0.30 to $0.40 for the year, maybe $0.09 dilution on a quarterly basis is the assumption that we would take the proceeds from the sale, roughly the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in pay down revolving debt that is in the -- not that I want to give you the guide in terms of our interest rate, but you can kind of know where revolving debt is these days for us up in the 6% range or so, approximately. You put that -- those proceeds towards paying down that debt, and that's the differential that brings that dilution down into the $0.09 per quarter or between $0.30 and $0.40 for the year. The math is really that simple, David. Yeah, Rick. Thanks for the question. So we're working through the process. I don't want to get into detailed discussions. We certainly haven't talked directly to the Competition Commission, but we've certainly done a fair amount of diligence. We're not sure where that will end up. We're pretty confident, very confident it gets approved. There could be some level of divestitures that was contemplated within the agreement that we work through. So nothing there that would concern us overly. And the other part is where Brookfield does have some towers the way they plan to run these also is competition friendly, I would say is the way that we kind of we view it there. So I don't want to go into more detail than that, but we do expect that the transaction would be approved and would have the ability to close it in the second half of 2024. Hey, Eric. Rod here. Thanks for the question. So regarding AFFO growth, let me just hit a couple of points. First, I'll just hit kind of generically what we look at as kind of a growth algorithm for the portfolio. And as Steve said, we're really pleased with the portfolio that we have the diversity that we have throughout developed markets as well as exposure to emerging markets. I would remind you and everyone that in those emerging markets, those are some of the largest populated industries in the world that need more and more infrastructure over time. And we do think having exposure to that is going to be really good for us and our investors in this growth algorithm. But the algorithm is really pretty straightforward. We look at it roughly 5% organic growth from the U.S. That includes some Sprint churn over the next few years there. We do expect that the non-U.S. properties will have incremental growth from there, maybe a couple of hundred basis points. And we think that's possible, certainly from Africa and Latin America over time, maybe not every year, but on average over a long period of time, which we expect to be there. We're looking at upper single-digit, double-digit growth rates from CoreSite with very nice returns. So that looks very good. And of course, as you move down the P&L, you end up with higher growth rates at gross margin and EBITDA margin, particularly with our focus on cost discipline reducing cost, managing costs, both direct costs as well as SG&A and driving expanded margins. So by the time you get down to AFFO, does that 5% U.S. growth, 7% international, double-digit CoreSite, all that can translate into upper single-digit AFFO growth pretty nicely. That's kind of what we look at. And then if you just look at 2023 and in 2024, in '23, we came in AFFO per share growth at around 1% or so. I'll just remind you that included 7% headwind from financing in the year. It included an additional 100 basis point headwind for the VIL reserve and maybe a full percentage point for FX. If you kind of do the math backwards, that core underlying business is solidly upper single-digit growth rate. In 2024, the guide is around 5%, getting us to that $10.33 per share. Financing headwinds in that is about 100 basis points. We have the reserve, broadly speaking, for India, and that's about a 100 basis point headwind as well. And with the FX volatility that we're seeing, and that's about a 200 basis point headwind again, you back up into that and you're getting into that upper single-digit kind of core growth. And I'll remind you that, that -- even that upper single-digit core growth has embedded in it higher-than-normal churn in some of the emerging markets as well as the Sprint churn in the U.S. As we go through that, being able to handle some modest FX and even financing items with churn being at a more normal level, certainly in the upper single-digit growth rates on AFFO and AFFO per share is in our line of sight. Hey, Batya. Rod here. So regarding Spain, you obviously saw that we had a write-down in our Spain market of about $80 million, that is exclusively rate driven based on the cost of capital as a function of our annual impairment testing. And I would also add to that, that the Spain market is performing very well in terms of hitting its metrics and milestones up against our original business case. I'd also remind you that the Spain business was really the only business in Europe that is 100% from the Telsius acquisition. There was no legacy business there prior to that transaction. But simply put, the impairment of about $80 million was exclusively a function of rising cost of capital running through a discounted cash flow impairment model. Hey, Matt. Regarding the tower life adjustment that you saw running through our numbers here, we essentially increased the tower life from 20 years to 30 years for book purposes for our GAAP books. And that was simply put, it\u2019s just a function of matching up the book life here more closely with what the actual realized life is for the assets. So nothing really more complicated than that other than a realization that these assets last a lot longer than 20 years. So our books will not reflect that going forward. Hey, Brandon. Rod here. The only thing I would add to Steve's comments there is that we have full optionality kind of going forward. I think Steve alluded to this, but going beyond 2024 the fact that we're investing $450 million in the data center business in 2024 does not commit us to that level or a higher level of capital spending in that business going forward. So we have a fair amount of flexibility to deploy capital towards towers, towards data centers, towards towers in developed markets, emerging markets, certain countries, not other countries as we go year-to-year. So we will be looking to secure that optionality, protect that optionality so we can always make decisions with our capital that follow the best risk-adjusted rates of return around the globe for any given year."

            "name": "Steven Vondran",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying it's an honor and a privilege to step into the role of CEO at American Tower. I want to thank Tom Bartlett for his leadership over the last 15 years of the company and congratulate him on an exceptional career. I certainly recognize I have big shoes to fill and to all of our stakeholders, I look forward to continuing to build on the tremendous success we've achieved together to date. In recent weeks, I've been telling many of our employees, customers and investors that I'm more excited today by the opportunity ahead that I've been in my 20 plus years with the company. There are two key reasons for that. First, we're still in the early stages of a mobility and computing-driven technology wave that suggests distributed digital infrastructure is going to be a higher demand for the foreseeable future. Second, we spent the last two decades developing a leading global portfolio with real estate, power and interconnection platforms that will serve as the core backbone of this wave. I believe we're now positioned to harvest the benefits of the scaled, differentiated tower and data center platforms we've built to provide unique value for our customers and best-in-class growth, profitability and returns for our investors. To deliver on that opportunity, we're going to be zeroing in on a few key areas in 2024 and beyond. To begin, we're committed to operating the highest quality portfolio. This means owning and investing in assets in the most attractive geographies where secular demand trends signal the potential for long-term sustained growth. Equally, it is important, it means securing business with market leaders, maintaining contract structures that maximize organic growth and minimize downside risks, as well as attracting and securing accretive development opportunities afforded by our in-market scale and leading operational capabilities. We saw the clear benefits of these factors play out in 2023. In our [indiscernible] U.S. and Canada Tower business, the 5G investment cycle and contributions from our comprehensive MLAs drove a record of roughly $230 million in colocation and amendment growth. International performance was also driven by record organic new business growth contribution and further supported by critical CPI-linked escalator terms and growth from our build-to-suit and power as a service programs. Furthermore, our differentiated CoreSite interconnection business saw second consecutive year of record signed new business. Going forward, we're going to continue our focus on maximizing organic growth across our existing assets and complement that incremental revenue generation through select development opportunities. At the same time, we'll continue to actively assess and challenge our prior capital allocation decisions to ensure the opportunity we see ahead across our global footprint is still supportive of our original underwriting thesis and apply what we've learned over the last two decades to our deployment plans going forward. Ultimately, we're focused on operating a portfolio that provides the proper mix of risk exposure and can deliver high quality, sustained top line growth supported by an operating structure that drives outsized rates of conversion to profitability and commands a premium in the market. That's a good segue into the next area of focus, which is delivering the most efficient global operating model centered around cost discipline, margin expansion and increasing returns on invested capital. Our global regional scale and long operating track record present an opportunity to further improve on the operating leverage inherent in the neutral host infrastructure model. We're accelerating initiatives in our regional operations to bring down direct cost per site, we're also investing in experimentation and implementation of AI applications and other technologies that create a more cost and time-efficient equipment deployment cycle bring greater precision and lower cost to our maintenance operations and improved yields on renewable energy generation, just to name a few examples. What it cost our overhead costs, as you'll see in our 2024 guidance, we're targeting a reduction in SG&A, which combined with healthy top line growth is supporting an 80 basis point reduction in cash SG&A as a percentage of property revenue and approximately 200 basis point expansion in cash adjusted EBITDA margin since 2022. Continued improvement to our cost structure and driving profitability is going to be a cornerstone in our both algorithm going forward. Next, and as we've highlighted on past calls, we're working today to further reinforce our balance sheet as a strategic asset. Our investment grade credit rating is at the core of our strategy, and that's not going to change. In fact, I believe market access and cost of capital advantages may be of even more strategic importance in this cycle than they were over the last decade. As Rob will elaborate on further, we made substantial progress towards strengthening the balance sheet in 2023. And as we look to 2024 and beyond, our capital allocation program is going to prioritize resiliency and flexibility in this evolving economic environment. Together with other strategic initiatives like reducing our overall capital intensity of executing on cost savings across the business, we'll hold the dividend relatively flat in 2024, subject to board approval. In turn, we'll prioritize a reduction to our gross debt balance and accelerate the pathway to achieving our net leverage target and enhance financial flexibility. As we've highlighted in the past, while M&A is not a priority today, as a company, we want to be in a position of strength when and if strategically relevant portfolios that meet our investment criteria do come to the market. In our internal CapEx program, we'll continue investing to expand our existing tower and data center platforms by selecting the opportunities with the highest risk-adjusted rates of return. At American Tower, we've developed a unique ability to allocate capital between our U.S. and international tower businesses as well as our U.S. based CoreSite platform. We see this as a distinct competitive advantage. While we continue to view the tower business as the best model out there, the flexibility we're building into our CapEx program and the robust cash flow assets generate allow us to be nimble and responsive to market conditions as we make capital allocation decisions over time, which in the near term means growing our exposure to developed markets. In our outlook for 2024, a larger share of our development capital is going toward the U.S. and Europe including expanding within our CoreSite footprint, where the same demand trends that have resulted in two consecutive years of record new leasing are expected to drive stabilized returns in the mid-teens for ongoing development projects. We're balancing out the expectation to build around 3,000 new tower sites, primarily in our international markets. This does represent a decline in volumes compared to 2022 and 2023, particularly as we assess certain risks in our emerging market footprint, including the FX volatility we've seen recently in Africa. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see partnering with market leaders to grow our tower portfolio globally as a key component of our long-term growth algorithm. Simply put, the changes in the global macroeconomic environment we've seen over the last 24 months and our balance sheet priorities, have raised the bar when it comes to required returns. And you're seeing discipline and flexibility reflected in the capital allocation expectations that we're rolling out for 2024. Finally, and foundational to our strategy are the people throughout the global business. Everything I've talked about today hinge is of the dedication and performance of our teams across the globe and the impact we can make for our customers, investors and the communities we serve. I've been so impressed by the teams I've met with and heard from over recent weeks, and we're going to continue strengthening our organization around the world and focus on developing, attracting and rewarding the best talent in the industry. In closing, I want to reiterate my comments from the outset. I believe there's tremendous opportunity ahead for American Tower. Evolving technology trends continue to drive demand for more ubiquitous, dense, low latency distributed networks. Against those trends, we're going to leverage our leading tower and data center platforms, balance sheet strength, capital allocation discipline and the dedicated teams that are supporting our global business to present a truly differentiated value proposition and compelling growth and return opportunities for shareholders. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our 2023 results and 2024 outlook. Sure. Well, thanks, Simon. Thanks for the good wishes there. I'll take that in a couple of pieces here. So I'll start out with what do we mean by the highest quality portfolio. And what we mean by that is, we're constantly reassessing all of our portfolios, both domestically and abroad and rechallenging all the decisions we made about capital allocation in the past and say, do they still meet our investment criteria. And if there's a challenge in the business, our first choice is to say what can we do to fix that? How can we get it to meet those criteria? And then the second thing, we would look at is ongoing capital allocation and is it a market or a business we want to continue to put capital into. So when we talk about the best quality portfolio, what we're saying is that we continue to look at that we found our assumptions there, and I did mention in my comments that if you look at a market like Nigeria, the macroeconomic conditions, including some of the FX translation issues have caused us to raise the bar in terms of acquired returns. So when we talk about that portfolio, we're looking at the market, the asset class, the demand for the assets, the contract structures we have in place, what types of contractual protections we can get for something like an FX devaluation, and we're shaping the portfolio for that. Now having said that, there's nothing to report beyond what we've already talked about in terms of the strategic review we did in India. We've been very clear that we're going to exit that market. We did exit Poland because it wasn't to scale for us and we did choose to exit Mexico fiber. And we'll continue to look at those other businesses that we have and make assessments on those. But there's nothing I would point to today to say that we're going to make any portfolio changes in the near term. The second question, I think you asked was how do we think about a market like Nigeria, and we believe that the emerging market portfolio is still an important part of our growth algorithm going forward. And we think that having the appropriate level of risk there to complement our developed market strategy will continue to allow us to elongate our growth curve over time there. We are mindful that there are some near-term challenges that we're seeing there. And you're seeing that play out some of our capital allocation decisions as we're rotating some of our discretionary CapEx for developed markets versus the emerging markets. You've also seen that play out in recent years with some of the inorganic acquisitions we've done. We did inside in the U.S., CoreSite in the U.S., Telsius in Europe. And those all had the effect of reducing our emerging market exposure, divesting India will reduce our emerging market exposure if we continue to allocate more of our development CapEx to developed markets versus emerging markets, that will also decrease our margin market exposure. So what you're essentially seeing play out there is us rebalancing our portfolio a little bit in response to the macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing, which we think is the appropriate thing to do in any environment is to look at the portfolio and rebalance it. And so that leads back into that highest quality portfolio. The second question I think you had was around CoreSite and what are we focused on there? Right now, most of our development CapEx is focused on expanding our existing campuses. And if you look at how that business has performed, we've had two years of record leasing, and we need to replenish the capacity that we have sold in those campuses. And it's a very good use of our capital. Again, we're looking at stabilized returns in the mid-teens. And if you think about the projects we have in our development, they're more than 40% pre-leased as of the end of the year. And so when you think about that business, pre-leasing is something that wasn't as prevalent in CoreSite pre-acquisition and that pre-leasing really reduces the risk of all that development, and it shortens the time period that it takes to get to those stabilized mid-teens returns. And so that's why you're seeing us pick up the investment there a bit. We do evaluate some Tier 2 markets in the U.S. You saw us buy a small data center in Miami, and we'll continue to look at whether there are sort of tuck-ins that we might want to do in the U.S. if we have an anchor tenant that's going to give us a good return going into it. And if we think it can turn into a more material campus for us later on. But it's not a huge priority for us. You're not going to see us put a lot of capital into that. And with respect to international expansion in data centers, that's not something we're leaning into at this point. We do have customers that would love for us to have a larger footprint than we do today. And we'll consider those opportunities. But there's nothing that I would point to today to say that we're going to do anything outside the U.S. in the near term? Thanks, Michael. Thanks for the well wishes there. So I'll start with your first question about the U.S. So we are predicting our guidance for OTBG in the U.S. is approximately 4.7%. And as you know, that's underwritten largely by our comprehensive MLAs that we have with our carriers. So we have a degree of insulation from the variability that you see in the deployment cadence there. We do have one of our big three carrier MLAs that has rolled off of its comprehensive portion of that MLA. And so that's gone to a little bit more of an a [indiscernible]. So you'll see that activity spread more through unloaded like it would have been in a comprehensive agreement. What we're seeing from the carriers in the U.S. is we are seeing an uptick in the conversations around activity. We've seen a modest increase in application levels already this year that's off to a pretty low base at the end of last year, but we are seeing some increase in activity. But before we get the applications, there's a degree of conversation, an inquiry that happens with our carriers. And especially with respect to our services business, we have a lot of conversation around that. And we're engaged on the front end of the process when they're doing their RF design sheets and trying to figure out what they're going to do for the year. And that's what's led us to believe that there's an uptick in activity, probably back-end loaded, and that's led to our increasing our guidance and our services business for next year. Now I would point out that if you look at our services guide, it's a little bit lower margin than previously. That's a result of having a little bit more construction services in that guide. And I do want to point out our construction business. That's something that we've not grown aggressively over the past. And when you think about that services business, we don't do that nationwide. We do it in pockets where we have the right resources and can you lean on third-party contractors to do the work. So if there are variabilities in the demand that we see there that we can cut our costs pretty quickly there. So that's one of the things we're seeing reflected in that services margin is a higher mix of construction services. But again, that's targeted by region, by carrier and it's not a huge business for us, but it's 1 that we think adds value to our customers, and it earns us a little bit more business. Okay. I'll start with the first question, and talk about the U.S. growth. So I would just point out that as a result of our comprehensive MLAs that our revenue is decoupled from the levels of activity to some extent. So I think comparing us to someone else's estimations of leasing new business is a little bit tough, just given the fact that we have a level of locked-in activity. And a large part of our rental growth is, it's locked in, it's either signed because it was signed last year, it's commencing this year. It's part of our comprehensive MLAs or there's a degree of carryover revenue and the OTBG number carries forward because the trailing 12-month metric there. The better analog for activity is our services business. And as we've said in the past, it's notoriously hard to predict exactly where you're going to land. A couple of years ago, we had to take guidance up quite a bit. Last year, we brought it down. So what we're providing here is, our best estimate given the levels of activity we're seeing, but also some of it can be more market-driven. So it may be activity in a particular market versus more ubiquitous activity, given that that's how we're performing some of that service has worked. We do see a general uptick in conversation from our customers that make us believe that there will be an uptick in the second half of the year. But as you think about that activity and the service levels of the -- service business with that activity, you have to do quite a bit of services work before you actually sign a new lease, if you're driving an a la carte environment. So it could just be timing that we're referencing there. But at the end of the day, our belief is, our property revenue growth or rental growth is largely locked in, and we feel confident in the portion that's not locked in, but that will come through in the cadence, we believe. And on the services side, we believe that we'll see a continuing ramp in that activity and that's what led to the guide on that. Sure. It's hard to give an exact time line, Rick, because it's different by different customers. So I would say from application to revenue showing up on an a la carte basis, there's a variability there from call it, 60 days to six months kind of what you referred to there. It really depends on the customer and how urgent they are to get on the site, to be honest with you. In terms of the cadence for the contribution from the new leases and colocation, it's relatively flat across the period. Again, I just would point out that we had the comprehensive portion of 1 of our major MLAs expired at the end of last year. And so that got rid of some of the front-end loading that you saw in previous years. So it will be more evenly distributed this year. Yeah. Rick, I'll take that one. Look, we didn't take the decision to hold the dividend flat lightly on that, and we were aware of the optics problem with a step down from Q4 to Q1. But we had committed to our shareholders to a certain dividend in 2023 and when we decided to hold it flat in 2024. If we didn't have the step up in Q4, then we would have -- then we wouldn't have hit the number that we had committed to. And so we like to do what we say we're going to do, and that's the reason we kept it there. And we think this has been very well telegraphed. We're trying to be very clear on our Q3 call about what was happening, and we've talked about it since then. And this is a one-time event. And so agree that it wasn't -- it's not the ideal situation, but we wanted to do what we say we're going to do and handle the dividend flat. So I'll start talking about the M&A environment. Look, we continue to monitor what's going on in the M&A activity across the portfolio. We're still seeing a dislocation between public and private multiples. And so there's no portfolio out there today that's trading that we think is strategically important that would meet our investment criteria. And that's one of the reasons that we're a little bit out of that market right now. One of the reasons that we're very focused on bringing our leverage down to the high end of our target range is to make sure that we're in a position to take advantage of inorganic opportunities when and if they come to market that we think are strategically important, but also to meet our investment criteria. So we're optimistic that there will be portfolios in the future that are something that we would be interested in. But right now, there's just nothing that I would point to you that we think is, is trading in a range that we would find compelling. I'll start with some leasing trends, Rod you can pick it up. So what we're seeing in Europe is we continue to see build-outs by the carriers. And we do see substantial 5G population coverage from the leading MNOs in Germany and Spain. So the pipeline of growth that we see remains solid, but it's more weighted toward colocations. In Germany, we are continuing to work through some of the market complexities that everyone's dealing with there, including some permitting delays and time for power connections. But we do feel good about the progress we've made there. We've brought in resources from other parts of our company to help with that and kind of utilizing best practices. So we do expect some improvement in our time lines there. So that's what we would expect to continue to see in Europe. There's a little bit more colocation driven activity and they're through the bulk of their 5G upgrades in most of our markets. So I'll start with the data center question. In general, with CoreSite, what we're seeing is demand is still largely driven by enterprises moving to hybrid cloud environment. And that's people who either or either cloud native or primarily cloud or they were still in their on-prem facility, that's still a major driver. We are seeing AI inferencing pick up in our facilities. We've always had some AI applications that we're targeting our facilities. So we are seeing demand there. More broadly speaking, AI is reducing overall capacity in the market or overall supply of the markets, which is leading to some favorable pricing trends for us. When it comes to the Edge deployment, we do think that AI inferencing in particular, in the interface people have with AI will lead to opportunities there. Right now, the near-term opportunities that we're exploring are more niche markets. You may have seen one of our partners put out a blog that we're working with them on an Edge facility kind of in the automotive market to update software on their products. We have a number of POCs that we're working on with various partners that are more niche applications in particular. I think the micro data centers at the base of the towers, facilitating AI is still a little bit further out. And we'll continue to update you guys if there's something to talk about there. But in the meantime, we just continue to work with our customers or potential customers on iterating on what that's going to look like. Sure. Well, the record amount of sales that we've had is what's led to increasing the development pipeline there. And it really depends on what our sales are this year and how we continue to see the opportunities in that portfolio evolve as to what the future spending are. So it would be premature for me to kind of guide future years' capital there. What I would reinforce is that we have a degree of optionality in our capital spending and that we do have a structure with CoreSite where we also have partners in that business. And so there is some optionality in terms of how much capital we put in, and you could see us using our capital or somebody else's capital to expand if we thought that was a better option for us. But at this point, the development pipeline we have today, we're choosing to sell fine because we're achieving mid-teens stabilized returns, very low risk in our existing campuses, and we continue to see demand rise. So we'll make that assessment into what's appropriate for 2025 and later a little bit later, and we'll share that with you guys at the appropriate time."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Barlett, our President and CEO will discuss current technology trends, and how our distributed portfolio of assets is positioned to benefit from ongoing wireless technology evolution. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer will discuss our Q3 2023 results and revised full year outlook. We are also joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our current Executive Vice President and President of our U.S. Tower division, who as announced this morning will assume the role of Global Chief Operating Officer effective November 1, before assuming the role of our President and Chief Executive Officer on February 1, 2024. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. And my focus for today's call will be on the technology trends and network investments that drive demand for our leading tower and data center platforms as well as the developments we're seeing at the edge. While my comments will largely be focused on the 5G evolution and the progress we're seeing in the United States, we believe similar trends will prevail across our international footprint as they have historically. Beginning with our macro tower business, the fundamental factor that drives demand for our global power portfolio, growth in mobile data consumption continues unabated. This is true both in the United States and across the globe, where mobile network data traffic has almost doubled over the last two years alone to a staggering 126 exabytes per month. Looking out over the next five years, forecasted growth in data traffic per device remains compelling as more spectrum for 5G networks will be deployed at scale. Average monthly data usage per smartphone across our key developed markets like the U.S., Germany and Spain is expected to grow at a healthy compounded annual rate of 18% between 2023 and 2028. And I would note that these estimates have been somewhat conservative historically. So let's spend a moment on where we are in the 5G investment cycle in the U.S. and where we believe we're going over the next several years. Just as we saw with the 3G and 4G rollouts, we expect the 5G investment cycle to play out in three phases that represent discrete business cases for the carriers and these three phases will drive two peak periods of spend that are bridged by a temporary phase of more moderate activity. The first phase is coverage-driven and aimed at upgrading existing infrastructure with new spectrum bands and radio technology, its competition to provide broad nationwide coverage with the new G ramps up. At the same time, carriers are looking to realize the efficiency benefits of their investments in new software, hardware and upgraded user devices. Initial equipment upgrades and new spectrum deployment quickly deliver reduced cost per gigabyte resulting in the ability to maintain margin profiles. Absent this migration, any incremental investments in the prior generation would be expected to result in significantly diminished returns as the additional densification required to sustain increasing network traffic on existing spectrum bands would be cost prohibitive. As the cadence of initial coverage investments begin to moderate from record spend of over $40 billion in 2022, the first peak of the 5G cycle, we retain a high degree of conviction that there's a long tail of network investment to come. This belief is predicated on several factors, including our experience with past investment cycles, industry forecast for growth in mobile data consumption that apply a necessity for significant incremental coverage and capacity and the visibility into network needs, we get through our contract structures. Today, Phase 1 of the 5G rollout is winding down and we're heading into a second phase. We expect Phase 2 to be characterized by carriers beginning to harvest the network efficiency benefits of their initial investments, while moderating spend from the record levels of 2022 to roughly $35 billion in 2023, which is $5 billion in excess of 4G averages, representing the second highest level of annual spend on record. In this next phase, we will begin to see a seeping in of 5G technology across the wireless and enterprise landscape. For example, 5G smartphone penetration has now surpassed the 50% mark in North America, which will ultimately allow for the majority of network traffic to shift over to 5G networks which we would expect to occur in the 2025 time frame. We're also looking forward to the emergence of more ubiquitous accessibility of stand-alone 5G core networks, which will unlock improved 5G network quality, higher speeds and lower latency and provide a platform for the development of innovative services and consumer applications. Finally, we anticipate that the arrival of end-to-end 5G capabilities will facilitate additional monetization opportunities at the enterprise level through use cases like private networks, network slicing and other IoT services that are beginning to emerge today. Ultimately, these dynamics will culminate in a third capacity focused phase aimed at significant densification of 5G networks. We continue to believe that 5G will advance and enable the next generation of mass market consumer use cases, particularly once 3GPP-released 17 and 18 are in the market, coupled with 5G cores that provide the true benefits of the end-to-end technology upgrade at scale. That said, meeting industry forecasts for growth in mobile data consumption that will drive the need for substantial network capacity investments seems highly achievable when taking into account the technology we have at our fingertips today. In fact, industry estimates already show that 5G subscribers are consuming 2 times to 3 times more mobile data than the average 4G subscriber. So let's take the case of mobile video consumption, which has consistently shown to be a dominant use case across subscriber usage types. As you can see on Slide 6, today the average smartphone subscriber in North America utilizes roughly 21 gigabytes of mobile data per month, and this is expected to grow to about 48 gigabytes by 2028. Of the 21 gigabytes consumed today, the majority or approximately 19 gigabytes are attributed to video streaming, which corresponds to a little over an hour of daily video usage and 360 and 480 pixel videos currently make up around half of that time. So by simply assuming a modest level of incremental usage towards higher resolution streaming such as 8 minutes of 4K Ultra HD, we would see video consumption alone drive usage to the forecasted 48 gigabytes per month or approximately 2.3 times the current rate. Furthermore, the data already shows that 5G is driving increased usage of higher resolution video formats. A recent report from Ericsson found that since 2021, 5G users report a nearly 50% increase in time spent on enhanced video formats. For example, among that user base, usage of new video formats like 360 degree videos and multi-view streaming have increased by an average of 10 minutes and 15 minutes per day, respectively, while time spent streaming videos and standard resolution has decreased by 23 minutes over the same period. In short, we've already seen 5G adoption linked with a shift in behavior towards using more data intensive applications, a trend we firmly believe will continue going forward. And while we remain confident that new low latency, high bandwidth consumer applications will be born as 5G standalone networks are deployed at scale, we see a highly tangible case for densification requirements from where we stand today. With that, I'll briefly provide an update on CoreSite in our data center segment before shifting to the progress we're making at the edge. The case remains that demand in CoreSite's interconnection centric business is exceeding our initial expectations. Our teams delivered record signed new business in 2022, a record we are targeting to exceed in 2023. We've also seen consistent elevated growth in interconnection revenue, mark-to-market pricing increases that exceed our historical averages, low churn and ongoing performance that we believe positions us to deliver compelling results in the segment for many years to come. And much like we see in our tower business, the secular trends that underpin the business model like the migration of workloads from on-prem to hybrid multi-cloud environments and the emergence of AI use cases that will drive more demand in our ecosystem continue on a path toward long-term acceleration. For example, findings from our recent 2023 state of the data center report showed that 94% of IT leaders noted that native direct connection between co-location data centers, major cloud providers, which CoreSite provides is essential for improved performance, enhanced security, cost savings and hybrid cloud connectivity. Further, 92% of IT leaders are considering moving critical workloads from public cloud to colocation to accelerate revenue growth and support the increasing need for AI and machine learning applications. In this context, we continue to upgrade our offerings and capabilities within the business to support emerging use cases. For example, earlier this month, we launched new capabilities on our OCX, our pioneering software defined networking platform, enabling clients to rapidly create higher bandwidth virtual connections to Google Cloud and AWS Direct Connect and between CoreSite data centers, including 50 gigabit services. These upgrades reduce the time required for organizations to augment network capacity to support high bandwidth, low latency hybrid applications like AI, machine learning and digital media production. When it comes to current and future AI and machine learning applications, CoreSite's flexible, purpose-built design data centers position us to host power-intensive GPU services being used for AI and ML use cases. For example, we're already providing GPU capacity for applications like 3D visualization and rendering and for software development with a niche cloud environment. And for the densest AI applications, our purpose built facilities are designed to accommodate liquid cooling with modest development efforts when required. As we've stated previously, in the near term, we continue to believe the majority of today's generative AI workloads will provide hyperscale opportunities that don't meet our investment criteria or fit within the CoreSite ecosystem. However, as GEN AI evolves, we would expect the balance of workloads to shift from large language model development, intensive training and public prompts to specialized inference-based use cases as productivity gains from the deployment of custom models accelerates. At this stage, when low latency interconnection high power density and distributed high performance compute become the priorities, we believe CoreSite and ultimately, our distributed portfolio of franchise real estate assets across the U.S. are going to be optimally positioned to benefit. On that note, we've continued to see progress toward the realization of demand cases that support our initial edge thesis, and we believe we have an opportunity to enable a more efficient exchange of network traffic and support cloud services and peering in a more distributed manner. As a result, we've been working both internally and with external stakeholders to develop an edge model we can execute on as compelling opportunities present themselves. In our initial assumption that through CoreSite, our seat at the table and visibility into the customer demand environment would be materially enhanced is holding true. We're increasingly seeing interest from potential customers looking to extend technologies such as private cloud computing AI and 5G applications closer to the end device through a more distributed architecture. This is resulting from several key demand cases including availability of future power requirements, business efficiency, revenue generation opportunities and customer experience. When it comes to power, CoreSite has secured significant future power availability and is insulated from expected shortages in markets like Northern Virginia. However, power constraints in general are increasingly in focus in legacy data center markets. In this case, we believe our distributed land footprint in Tier 2 and 3 markets with significant power availability and capability to connect back to CoreSite campuses can serve more distributed power capacity needs, while enabling customers to enjoy the interconnection benefits of the CoreSite ecosystem. And as potential customers increasingly focus on new revenue opportunities and customer experience including through the proliferation of applications like next-generation gaming, AR and devices and wearables that leverage interactive AI, we believe we have a compelling combination of distributed points of presence and interconnection capabilities that can be extended to a broader edge. In addition, by prioritizing our existing owned real estate, which in many cases is already designated for use as digital infrastructure, we see an opportunity to drive a significant time to market advantage and reduce overall development costs, which could be compelling to customers and enhance returns on investment. As a result of these factors, we continue to work towards establishing a repeatable, rapidly deployable design with initial capacity in the 1 megawatt range, which could then be scalable to incremental megawatts with interconnection to multisite campuses as demand dictates. As always, we'll assess potential growth at the edge through the prism of our disciplined capital allocation framework committing capital only if the opportunity meets our investment criteria and aligns with our long-term strategic vision of growing our interconnection ecosystem in a way that maximizes shareholder value. In closing, the bottom line is that we remain at the relatively early stages of a 5G and network technology evolution that we believe will necessitate continuous incremental investment in existing infrastructure like towers, data centers and distributed edge infrastructure. We also believe that ongoing technology developments will unlock new capabilities that will drive the next wave of innovative and data intensive consumer and enterprise devices and applications. And American Tower, with its leading tower portfolio and real estate footprint combined with a highly interconnected data center ecosystem is in a truly differentiated position to serve the network infrastructure needs of the future. Before I hand the call over to Rod, I'd like to close my remarks by congratulating Steve Vondran, who effective November 1 will hold the role of Global Chief Operating Officer until February 1 of next year, at which point he'll transition to the position of Chief Executive Officer; and Bud Noel, who will become our new Executive Vice President and President of our U.S. Tower Division. The Board and I have worked diligently on succession planning weighing the merits of an external search against the talent we have within our organization. Steve joined American Tower in 2000 and currently serves as the Executive Vice President of our U.S. and Canada business, including both towers and data centers. For the past 23 years, Steve has been instrumental to the growth and sustainability of earnings from American Tower and has built tremendous credibility with our global organization his peers, the Board of Directors, the American Tower investor base and our customers. All this to say, Steve is a clear candidate to lead American Tower in its next growth phase. And over the next several months, I'll work closely with Steve, the executive leadership team and the Board to ensure a seamless transition. Lastly, I want to thank all of the incredible American Tower employees around the world both past and present, our customers and investors for their support and confidence you've demonstrated since I joined in 2009. Although, this is a difficult decision on my part, I look forward to the time ahead with family and friends and new challenges, while watching the company under Steve's leadership continue to succeed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to review our latest results and updated outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. In Q3, we continued our trend of strong performance, driven by solid demand for our diverse global portfolio of assets. Against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we remain focused on delivering results and creating value by driving organic growth across our existing portfolio and demonstrating global operational efficiency and cost management in support of attractive margin expansion. At the same time, we are committed to strengthening our balance sheet by enhancing our liquidity extending our maturities, reducing floating rate debt volatility and making progress towards our leverage target. These efforts coupled with the evolving technological trends highlighted by Tom, remain key drivers of our current performance and give us confidence in our ability to drive sustained growth over the long term. Before delving into the specifics of our Q3 results and raised outlook, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we saw a continuation of solid trends across our global operations, driving consolidated property revenue growth of 7%, consolidated organic tenant billings growth in our tower business exceeded 6% for the third consecutive quarter and was complemented by over 9% revenue growth in our data center business. As a result of this strong performance and visibility extending through the end of 2023, we raised our full year expectations across nearly all segments, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Next, our keen focus on cost management resulted in conversion rates exceeding 100% and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 290 basis points year-over-year and still over 215 basis points when normalized for the prior year VIL revenue reserves, complementing our operational efforts. On the balance sheet side, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of approximately 5.9% by utilizing the proceeds to pay down revolver balances, we reduced our floating rate debt exposure to approximately $4 billion or less than 11% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the third quarter down from over 22% at the start of the year. Finally, we're making significant progress on the strategic review of our India business. As we are in the final stages of this process, we remain committed to communicating the outcome to our shareholders before the end of the year, consistent with our past messaging. In Q3, we recorded $322 million in goodwill impairment charges associated with our India business. This was prompted by indications of value obtained through the process conducted over the past several months, supported by our own interim goodwill impairment test. We believe this impairment accurately reflects the current market conditions, evolving risk premiums associated with operating in the India market and more generally increases in the cost of capital. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, consolidated property revenue growth was 7% or 8% on an FX neutral basis. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was over 5%, which includes a nearly 2% headwind associated with a reduction in straight-line revenue, offset by timing benefits associated with certain non-recurring one-time items in the quarter. International growth was nearly 9% or approximately 11% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which included a 4% benefit associated with the full collection of VIL billings in India in the quarter, as compared to the approximately $48 million revenue reserve in the prior year. Finally, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, our data center business revenue increased by over 9% and continues to demonstrate solid outperformance as compared to our initial underwriting plan. As Tom mentioned earlier, we anticipate 2023 to again break the signed new business record just set in 2022, setting up CoreSite to drive sustained attractive levels of growth as the backlog of new business commences over the next several years. Moving to the right side of the slide. Strong performance across each of our segments drove consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%. Within our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.3% and greater than 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of colocation and amendment contributions of nearly $60 million. Our International segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily driven by higher new business in Africa and churn delays in Latin America and APAC resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9%. Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 10% to $1.8 billion for the quarter or approximately 11% on an FX neutral basis. As I highlighted in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 64.4%, a 290 basis point improvement compared to the previous year, primarily driven by solid organic growth, effective cost management throughout the business and the one-time revenue items I mentioned. In fact, despite the current inflationary environment, we have managed to maintain a relatively flat year-over-year cash SG&A profile remaining consistent with the themes from the first half of the year, with cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue standing at approximately 6.5% for the quarter, a nearly 70 basis point improvement versus Q3 of 2022. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share each increased by over 9%, driven by solid cash adjusted EBITDA growth partially offset by an approximately 5% headwind from financing costs. Now shifting focus to our revised full year outlook. I'll start by highlighting a few key items. First, as a result of our strong performance in the third quarter and the momentum taking us through the end of the year, we've raised our guidance for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. Next, our revised outlook includes a reduction in U.S. services, resulting in a $20 million decrease in gross margin compared to our previous expectations for the year. As we've highlighted in the past, although, quarter-to-quarter variations in tower leasing activity have impacted our services revenue in 2023, our leasing revenue remains unaffected, underpinned by the comprehensive master lease agreements currently in place. Finally, the updated midpoints include revised FX assumptions that have resulted in outlook to outlook headwinds of approximately $28 million for property revenue, $14 million for adjusted EBITDA and $5 million for attributable AFFO. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $60 million as compared to our prior outlook. Our revised expectations are driven by $31 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with approximately $45 million and $12 million in additional pass-through and straight-line revenues, respectively. Our revised guidance includes $10 million in outperformance associated with VIL collections with roughly half included in our core property revenue and the balance in the pass-through outperformance illustrated. Growth was partially offset by $28 million of negative FX impacts. Turning to Slide 11. We are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth across nearly all segments. In the U.S. and Canada, we are increasing our guidance to greater than 5% or approximately 6.5% excluding Sprint churn, now with an expectation for approximately $230 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. Growth is further benefiting from non-Sprint related churn delays, which we now anticipate occurring in 2024. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from approximately 4% up now to approximately 5%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from greater than 11% to approximately 12%, primarily due to a continued uptick in colocation and amendment demand. In APAC, we are increasing our guidance from approximately 4% to about 5% supported by a combination of strong new business in delayed churn. Moving on to Slide 12. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $60 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue highlighted earlier, coupled with prudent cost controls, resulting in an incremental $67 million in cash property gross margin outperformance along with an additional $14 million in cash, SG&A savings and $30 million of straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $20 million associated with our U.S. services business and a negative FX impact of $14 million. Turning to Slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint or approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.79 per share. Our performance was driven by the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $61 million partially offset by $16 million of other items, including an acceleration of certain maintenance projects in cash taxes, along with incremental minority interest due to outperformance in our JV businesses, partially offset by improvements to net interest. As I noted earlier, FX caused a headwind of approximately $5 million. Moving on to Slide 14. Let's review our capital allocation plans for the full year. Consistent with the expectations set at the beginning of the year, we are planning to distribute approximately $3 billion in common stock dividends which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 10% on a per share basis, subject to board approval. Our full year CapEx spend also remains consistent at $1.7 billion with the acceleration of certain non-discretionary projects that I mentioned earlier, offset by lower discretionary spend, which includes a reduction in development CapEx associated with lower anticipated new build volumes. As always, our goal is to execute a capital deployment strategy that maximizes total shareholder returns. In line with my earlier remarks, we're focused on creating incremental value through solid organic growth and quality of earnings optimizing global operational efficiency and expanding cash margins, all while strengthening our financial position by further reducing balance sheet risk and enhancing financial flexibility. As it relates to capital allocation and against the current economic backdrop, we believe it's optimal to prioritize balance sheet strength and keep discretionary spend focused on select capital expenditure projects that yield the best risk-adjusted returns and quality of earnings. Additionally, decoupled from our current line of sight to its attributable AFFO growth for next year, we anticipate maintaining a dividend per share profile in 2024 that closely aligns with our 2023 expectation of $6.45 per share resuming growth in a manner supportive of our REIT taxable income thereafter, all subject to Board approval. By focusing on the above priorities, we believe American Tower is positioned for sustained and compelling total shareholder returns supported through balance sheet strength over the long term. Consistent with our historical practice, we'll discuss our 2024 plans in more detail on our next earnings call. Moving to the right side of the slide and as highlighted earlier, as a result of the successful execution of our financing initiatives in the third quarter, we reduced our floating rate debt balance to below 11%, increased our liquidity to $9.7 billion, and our average maturity remains over six years. We closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5 times, which benefits from certain non-recurring items in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect to close the year slightly above 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic and potentially further accessing the debt capital markets, ensuring continued strength in our balance sheet, reducing risk and enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 15, and in summary, our diverse portfolio of global communications assets continue to demonstrate resiliency in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, producing attractive growth through organic leasing, further amplified by exceptional cost management at the margin. Complementing our operational performance, we continue to make progress in strengthening and de-risking our balance sheet. Furthermore, we remain committed to managing our capital structure, sources and uses and capital allocation priorities in a manner that positions American Tower to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Tom, all the best for the future. It's been great working with you over the years, even back to the Verizon use of cell days. And Steve, congratulations and best of luck in the new role. If we could come back to the capital allocation please. The comments around the dividend and perhaps, Rod, you could just talk about target leverage? Are you thinking about bringing leverage down more aggressively given the rate environment and the uncertain macro environment? Just any color around that would be great or any other drivers of the dividend decision? And perhaps how are you thinking about M&A more broadly outside of the India process that you referenced earlier. There's a big gap here between public and private markets. Any opportunities there that you see? And what about buybacks? Is that something that could come into your toolbox in the coming quarters here? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. Simon, good morning. Thanks for joining. I'll hit the leverage piece first, and then Tom will address the dividend more broadly. When you think about the leverage, we've been a little bit higher than our stated range. We've been up in the 5, 3 range. We did end this quarter at around 5.0 that was benefited from some non-recurring one-time revenue items. So we do expect that to tick back up towards the end of this year. And we expect to end this year, again, higher than our stated range of 3 to 5 times up in the 5.2%, 5.3% range. It is a priority of ours to bring that leverage down, along with driving organic growth operational efficiency, expanding margins, controlling the SG&A in the -- and ultimately, the AFFO and AFFO growth that we can drive. So the target is to get to 5.0 as soon as we can. We'll be working through that diligently next year. And a lot of these operational objectives around organic growth and driving AFFO as well as capital allocation, our capital plan, specifically you'll see a reduction -- you've seen a reduction in our capital plans this year versus last year. And that, again, is all in line with trying to drive down leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. We do think those are important steps to take to drive total shareholder return in the short term and the long term. So that's what it's really all about the dividend holding it flat next year is in line with that. I mean, I'll say, we believe that's the best use of capital in terms of strengthening the balance sheet in this time of uncertain rates. When it comes to M&A, we continue to not see compelling M&A opportunities in our pipeline. So it's not something that's hitting our radar screen in terms of capital allocation this year and we turn the corner into next year. Then I'll turn it over to Tom to hit and a little bit more directly.\nTom Bartlett: First of all, Simon, thanks for your kind words. But maybe with regards to the dividend, it's important just to just take a step back and understand how we really manage this dividend growth. Since we became a REIT over a decade ago back in 2012, we've always looked to complement AFFO growth with a compelling yield, which we've grown, as you all know, around 20% annually as compared to our AFFO per share growth, which has been closer to 10% over that same time period. We've aligned our distribution with REIT taxable income, as you would expect. And within REIT AI you do have a recurring run rate and more of one-time buckets, consistent of things like earnings and profits, settlements, throwbacks NOLs, which we used last decade, much of which is discretionary in the planning that are absolutely separate from AFFO. And these tools allow us for to manage a more predictable glide path on our dividend. So here we are in 2023, we're committed to a 10% dividend growth rate which, like other years, consisted of certain one-time items to manage the dividend path and ensure alignment between our distribution and REIT AI. And so although our recurring REIT AI bucket was negatively impacted by interest rates, we utilize certain one-time items to manage towards the distribution. And absent those items, like most years, we'd be overdistributed. So as we look ahead to '24, we see an opportunity to accelerate our glide path and reset REIT AI closer to the run rate, which means temporarily relatively flat dividends per share in '24 decoupled from our expectations for AFFO growth based on our line of sight today. So our priorities that Rod just laid out really remain on maximizing our total shareholder returns. And we see the optimal path to do so, really centered around strengthening and de-risking our balance sheet, which means, in part, reducing our debt balance and advancing our pathway to sub 5 times net leverage and with that, more financial flexibility. And we view the levers to accelerate this path through maximizing organic growth, reducing our cost base as we've done in '23 and will continue to do in '24 with disciplined capital allocation that Rod just referred to, together with managing the dividend in a relatively flat basis before resuming growth in line with our recurring REIT AI thereafter. So this isn't a decision we take lightly, as you would expect. But given the current macro volatility, we believe that the balance sheet strength and accelerating financial flexibility for future opportunities, which could include buybacks is the optimal approach from where we sit today. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense, at least in terms of how we're thinking about it and how it fits into our overall plans for creating value long term.\nSimon Flannery: Right. Yeah. That's very helpful. So just to be clear, the hope would be to resume dividend growth in '25 or into 25?\nTom Bartlett: Yes.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank a lot.\nOperator: And next, we go to Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thank and good morning. And Tom, I also want to express my thanks and best wishes for your upcoming retirement. Congratulations to Steve on your upcoming transition to the CEO role. Just a couple of questions for me. -- You're welcome. And again, thank you, it's both at Verizon and at AMP. We've been working...\nTom Bartlett: We got a long answer. My hairline has received more than years\nMichael Rollins: So a couple of things. So first, on activity levels in the domestic business. Curious, if you could just go deeper into what you're seeing as you're looking at the balance of this year and what it means for next year in terms of how that domestic business can grow relative to the long-term annual targets that you set for that business? And if you can -- within that context, also unpack the delays that you're seeing in Sprint related churn and what that means for that decommissioning pace as we look forward? Thanks.\nRod Smith: Sure. I'll take that one. So we're not going to give specific guidance for 2024 at this time, obviously. And I don't want to get into specific care activity levels because I want to leave it to them to talk about the rollout plans. But in general, we have seen activity levels moderate over the last several months from the recent highs. However, the visibility that we have into a baseline level of contractually guaranteed growth through these comprehensive MLAs allow us to reiterate our expectation that we're going to achieve an average annual OTBG growth rate of at least 5% in the U.S. and Canada segment between 2023 and 2027. And despite some of the concerns that people have in the market over the recent moderation we have visibility into a level of organic growth in 2024 that's supportive of that average. Now having said that, I want to break down the components a little bit, we do not have visibility into another year of $230 million growth from colocation and amendment activity. That's far away a record from American Tower. But we balance that with an expectation for some moderation in churn following 2023, excluding Sprint. Our MLAs do provide us visibility into a level of colocation and movement contributions that exceeds the average we've seen over the past several years. And again, it's supportive of that at least 5% average OTBG that we've guided to between 2023 and 2027. And to reiterate on our Sprint churn, the annual impacts of our Sprint churn have been $195 million in 2021, $60 million in 2022, and $50 million in 2023 and $70 million in 2024 for a total of $375 million. So we're past the peak of that churn, and there's no change to that cadence versus our prior guidance in that respect.\nTom Bartlett: And Mike, I would just add just to make it clear, the delays in churn that we're seeing in the U.S. is not Sprint related. It's other items that we were planning that could be moved out a bit, as Steve is saying the Sprint cadence has not changed. And when you think about next year 2024 in our long-term guide, it's unlikely that there's going to be material upside based on where we sit today. We do think there's potential for upside in the longer-term growth rates, but that would probably come in '26 and '27 and down the line, not necessarily in '24.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And just one quick one, what's the percent that you're seeing in terms of the mid-band upgrades, the percent of sites that have been upgraded for mid-band already versus the amount that might be remaining?\nRod Smith: It\u2019s a little over half at this point.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And next, we can go to David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions and let me echo Tom, the years we've spent together. It's been great and congrats to Budd and Steve on the new roles.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Dave.\nDavid Barden: So I guess, if I could start, just maybe more on the finance side, Rod. Slide 11, you talked about some of the increases we're seeing in some of the non-U.S. regions. Could you break that down into kind of core organic leasing and then some of the inflation driven escalators? And so is this real growth that we're seeing that could be sustained or is it more of an inflation driven bubble that we need to kind of be conscious of that might reverse? And then second, just on the India situation with the write-down, I think the tactic acknowledgment that maybe some of the loftier valuation ambitions were not there. I guess we're all sitting here trying to figure out what kind of dilution we should be baking into 2024? The latest press reports that India suggested kind of a $2 billion valuation, something like a 5 times EBITDA multiple. Obviously, it depends on kind of how big a stake you sell and when you sell it. But is there any kind of more color you can shed on the shape of what kind of dilution expectation we should be thinking about for '24? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah, David. So let me hit the first part of your question. I think I missed a little bit of the second, so I may ask you to repeat that. But when you think about the upside in terms of the growth rates, let me hit it by addressing the organic tenant billings piece first-off. So we are seeing increases in organic tenant billings really across the board. So you can see in the charts, they were increasing our overall organic tenant billings for the company to about 6%, that's up about 50 basis points from prior. And that kind of -- that theme is consistent across many of the regions. So as Steve just highlighted in the U.S., we're bringing that guide to beyond 5% from what was previously around 5%. International is coming up to greater than 7%. Prior, we were at greater than 6.5%. And then you look at the different parts of the company region by region, LatAm is going up to about 5% versus what was previously a 4%. APAC is coming up to about 5%. Previously, it was 4%. Europe was staying around where it was at 8%. And then Africa is also coming up to around 12% from what was prior higher than 11%. A couple of things that I would say, in terms of the stay ability or the durability of some of that growth, certainly, in the U.S., it's nice strong performance. There is a little bit of delayed churn, so we can expect to see that hit next year. Other than that, the U.S. is very steady in terms of the demand. Part of that is because of the way the contracts we have work out. When you think of Latin America, we do have higher levels of churn this year than we have had in prior years. Some of the outperformance is churn driven. So when you think about the LatAm over performance, it's really a delay in churn and probably not all that durable from that perspective. When you get into APAC, it's a similar situation. The increase there is delayed churn, maybe some delayed discounts. Europe is staying in line. In Africa, we're seeing higher levels of new business activity. So much of that is, in fact, durable and lasting, that's the way I would kind of articulate that. And then maybe on the second question, if you could maybe just repeat the question about the dilution, just so I get it right.\nDavid Barden: Hey. Yeah, Rod. Thank you. So I think we were just trying to \u2013 and thank you for those comments, that's helpful on the pieces part. The -- just the India write-down would seem to suggest that the bid-ask spread between what maybe AMT hopes to accomplish from a valuation standpoint and what's been offered has kind of collapsed down to the offer the side of the spread? And is that the right interpretation or reading through that write-down. And then obviously, we're all attempting to evaluate what the dilution effect for the sale might be on 2024. Any more color on whether it's a full divestiture or 50% divestiture and kind of timetable would help us kind of do that math? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. That's good, David. Thank you. So we're making good progress with the strategic review that we've set out. In terms of the write-down, we are writing the India business down about $322 million and sets the book value in around $2.2 billion or so. And as I stated in my prepared remarks, it really is based on our internal impairment review analysis, discounted cash flow driven and certainly, cost of capital plays a significant role in that. But also, as I highlighted in my comments, it does also consider indications of value that we've determined throughout the process. So I think you can understand what that means, and it will help you kind of think about where things might fit. We've also provided a little bit more breakout on the India financials and some of -- in the back of the presentation, which you'll see. But in terms of revenue, we're a little over $1 billion EBITDA. It's about $355 million. Unlevered AFFO is about $290 million. So that gives you a little bit more information to kind of piece through and kind of assume where we may -- the way we may have. I don't want to get into too much direct guidance. We'll certainly lay that out when we complete our strategic review, which -- the good news is we're happy with the way the process is evolving. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be concluding it this year just as we\u2019ve previously mentioned, once we do, we\u2019ll let the investors know exactly what we\u2019ve concluded and what we plan to do there. We\u2019ve said that our goal, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our goals, which is to sell a majority equity stake to a financial investor. We\u2019ve said between 51% and 100%, the reality is it\u2019s probably going to be a majority stake. We probably will retain a stake, so it will be somewhere between that 61% and 100%. That\u2019s where we\u2019re kind of directing the process at this point. But again, we are confident that the process will conclude in the next couple of months. And when it does, we\u2019ll let the investors know exactly what we\u2019ve done.\nDavid Barden: Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Good luck everybody.\nRod Smith: Thanks.\nOperator: And next, we'll move to Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRichard Prentiss: Guys, I'll echo the bell head, thanks for the memory, Tom. it's been great working with you. I think we went to your first NAREIT like, 14 years ago.\nTom Bartlett: Absolutely. You set up the table for us at the NAREIT conference, Rick, I remember that.\nRichard Prentiss: Yeah. And Steve, been great working with you in the past, and we look forward to the new role.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Rick.\nRichard Prentiss: Yeah. I want to go back to the dividend question from a couple of different angles as well. Rod, I think you mentioned $6.45 a share approximately current dividend announcing getting paid shortly would imply a little bit higher than that $6.48. Are we thinking it's in that range or is the $6.45 million more we should be thinking about?\nRod Smith: Yeah. I think at this point, think about it being flat year-on-year. So, of course, every quarter, we get the dividend approved by the Board. But our intention is to hold the dividend flat annually year-over-year to help support deleveraging balance sheet strength and ultimately, AFFO growth as well as total shareholder returns.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. I appreciate the comments that you're trying to kind of decouple from AFFO, more related to the REIT taxable income, it sounds like as well, but sort of implicit in that isn\u2019t also that thought that the India sale is anticipated and that also can kind of affect what the dividend might have been prior thoughts.\nRod Smith: Yeah. I guess, Rick, I would say that's not correct. The India business isn't in our REIT at this point. So it really doesn't drive into the retaxable income issue. I think Tom articulated all the drivers with that, which it's really -- this is a management decision and certainly supported by our Board to prioritize capital to prioritize deleveraging and balance sheet strength, it's not impacted by the India process at all. And Tom highlighted, there are certain REIT rules that allow one-time items in some pretax earnings to be moved from one period to another. So there have been times in the past where we've been over under distributed, and we can move some of that over or under distribution back and forth from year-to-year, which is helpful. So in this case, it really is a decision to drive balance sheet strength and using our capital in the best way we can again, to drive total shareholder return in the short term and in the long term. And in this market with uncertain interest rates going forward, we think that's prudent and that's really the driving factor.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And then, you said there was a small acquisition from AT&T/SBCs talking about history lesson. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the marketplace as far as multiples in the U.S., Europe and other places.\nRod Smith: Yeah, Rick. I would -- let me highlight first that we don't see compelling M&A on our pipeline. I think everyone kind of knows that, I'll just reiterate that. We are seeing some things out there. Certainly, there is -- not as robust, but there is a market in the U.S. with some smaller portfolios. And I don't want to get into a lot of detail in terms of what we see. I think we still see very high prices, even though they may have pulled back slightly from where they were, let's say, a year ago. And for that, we still look at the small deals if we can find compelling ways to expand total shareholder return. We have a little flexibility there. We don't see anything major. But we also just see the majority of the deals are probably still priced a little higher than what today's cost of capital would suggest that they should be. The small acquisition you see in our numbers is really just a buyout of a prior SBC sublease, which you'll be familiar with. It was a small tranche.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. Was that some of the final purchase option stuff as well?\nRod Smith: Yeah. That's exactly what it is. It's not the final one. It's just another tranche, and that will continue for a few more years.\nRichard Prentiss: Makes sense. And last one for me then. I think you've mentioned that all assets are coming on the tail we reviewed with India getting closer to this process. Any update as far as what you're looking at on the balance sheet that might be possible to say it's not where they are, where we thought it would be or maybe someone else wants to pay more, given private versus pilot multiples?\nRod Smith: Yeah. I would say, Rick, we routinely review the portfolio performance across our business globally. We do that from a couple of perspectives. One is, there could be capital recycling opportunities, which we think could be very good for our shareholders over the long term, that certainly the decisions we saw driving our exit from the Mexico fiber business. It also is what is driving our consideration around what we're doing in India. So I'll highlight that, I don't want to get into specific other places where we might be looking. But we are looking at our portfolio, and it's something we do constantly. The other thing we do is, we constantly look at our capital deployments. And from that perspective, we can throttle those back or up depending on where the opportunities are. We can also reallocate or redistribute that capital to where we feel that investments will most -- will be most aligned with our priorities of driving organic growth in the short term and the long term, quality of earnings and consistent durable industry-leading AFFO growth and ultimately, total shareholder return. So I wouldn\u2019t just look at whether or not we sell a business here or there, those would be kind of operational decisions as well as recycling capital, but also kind of our CapEx programs, how much are we investing? Where are we investing? What kind of assets. And again, those decisions are made each and every year, really each and every quarter, and they are meant to and do align with our priorities.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. Thanks, guys. And again, best wishes everybody.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: And next -- pardon me, next we go to Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two related to the U.S. Maybe first on services. So it was a pretty sizable drop off maybe less surprising in terms of what's going on in the industry, but services revenue looks like they dropped off in third quarter. Just wondering if you can share any color in terms of whether this is broad-based or related to one or two customers in particular and how to think about sort of forward trajectory into 4Q? And then, maybe on a somewhat related note, in terms of colo and amendment activity in the U.S., so, 3Q held in relatively stable to what you saw in the first half. I think the implied number for 4Q is around $53 million. Just wondering whether that's sort of an appropriate run rate to consider into next year or whether we should anticipate sort of incremental moderations by virtue of just a broader low in the industry? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: Sure. I'll start out and then, if you want to jump in, Rod. In terms of our service business, it's inherently a non-run rate business, and that makes it difficult to predict. And you saw that in 2021 when we raised our guide materially over a couple of quarters, we're seeing that this year as we've seen a moderation of activity. What I would say is because of our cooperative MLAs, that's not a direct read across to our property revenue, because we are somewhat insulated from the peaks and valleys of activity with the customers on that. And it's too early to be giving guidance for 2024 and where we see the activity levels going there. What I would just reiterate is this is consistent with what we've seen in other Gs of activity. And the carriers have an initial build phase that starts out with kind of a [indiscernible] of activity, and you'll see that moderate a little bit. We are seeing the capital spend moderate a bit, but it's still settling at levels higher than it was in 4G. And even with our reduced expectations this year for our services business, it's still higher than it was at the same point in 4G. So we're very optimistic that customers will continue to build throughout the cadence of this 5G build. There will be a restart of that activity. We don't know exactly when that's going to happen and we'll give better guidance on that in February as we get more visibility into 2024, what those activity levels are going to be.\nRod Smith: Yeah. And Matt, I'll just add a couple of data points. When you think about the co-location amendment additions. This year, we're anticipating a number of around $230 million for the U.S. You recall last year, we were around $150 million, we're at about $58 million this quarter and our guide anticipates a further reduction, but still a number that's greater than $50 million in Q4. I wouldn't just take that Q4 number and annualize. And I think you're better off and we won't give guidance, as Steve suggest until next year. But for modeling purposes, if you look at this year and last year and you split the difference, that's probably a safer place to put in your models today. And then, of course, we'll guide in February, and we'll be able to update that number. The only other thing I would say on services is the $140 million number is still higher than the historical average for services, and we're continuing to maintain a very nice gross margin in that business at all levels. So when we saw that go up to about $270 million, we were still in the 50s, low 50s, 53%, 54% margins as it tapered off a little bit to $140 million, we are able to drive up the margins based on the mix of the revenue and the way we service that revenue. So with a lower revenue, we\u2019re still able to mitigate some of that with higher margins in the upper 50s at this point.\nMatthew Niknam: Appreciate it. Thank you both.\nTom Bartlett: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we'll go to Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple on capital allocation. So given the recent increases in interest rates and cost of capital, I mean, to influence at all as you look into next year, kind of your build-to-suit ambitions internationally or is there any kind of valuation of maybe slowing that to reinvest in other areas and that could potentially be data centers where it seems like you've had really strong performance year-to-date. It seems like growth continues to ramp and maybe you need to allocate more capital to your data center business and how you kind of balance that versus other forms of shareholder return? That would be very helpful. Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. Good morning, Eric. Thanks for joining in. And absolutely, all those issues are on the table. We look at our capital allocation every year, certainly, and I would say, even more frequently than that in the idea and the approach is to make the best decisions we can to support long-term total shareholder return. With the increase in cost of capital, the increase in interest rates as well as other factors affecting our markets around the globe, those all play into how much capital we will be deploying, how many build-to-suits will be executing on and where those will be. So that certainly comes into play. I won't get into a lot of detail in terms of decision-making there. I would just maybe highlight again that capital this year is lower than it was last year. And the environment in interest rates, in particular, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty. So we will be continuing to kind of look at that capital plan to decide if putting the capital into build-to-suits around the globe is better than some of the other options we have and a continuation of capital reductions is probably what you'll end up seeing in this environment. That's kind of where we're looking at it. The other part of your question is absolutely, we look at putting capital into places that primarily or specifically drive and align with our priorities. So when you think about us focused on organic growth over the long term, we're focused on quality of earnings. We're focused on operational efficiencies and driving balance sheet strength, all of the different ways that we can execute on achieving those goals are in play. If that means allocating more capital to higher quality markets versus emerging markets or vice versa. If it means putting less into CapEx and more into debt reduction, if it means reducing the growth of the dividend and putting more towards balance sheet and debt reduction. We think about those things all the time and it plays into our capital allocation and it will next year as well, and we'll lay out what that will mean in February.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up question. Latin America, you've talked about some delayed churn in that business. So maybe you could just kind of walk us through the cadence of when that you expect that churn to kind of layer through and when you may be on the other side of it. And then, obviously, it seems like given a pretty big reduction in inflation in some of those markets like Brazil, would seem to seem like the CPI-linked escalators will be a bit of a headwind at least into next year. So maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces and the growth outlook there? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. A couple of things that I\u2019d \u2013 that I highlight relative to the LatAm market. I mean in 2022, we had roughly 5% churn that was part of embedded in our organic tenant billings growth. In Q3 here, it was 5.2%, so pretty consistent. For the full year of '23, we're projecting that to be around 6%. So that's what's driving. When we say elevated churn, that's exactly kind of what we're seeing there. We are seeing delays in churn. Much of that is tied to the oi churn (ph) that we're experiencing and will continue to experience down in Brazil. We also see churn from Telefonica up in Mexico. Those are kind of the two primary places where we see churn. We've laid out a lot of the different pieces of the oi churn. I won't do that again here. But I would say, we do expect elevated churn to continue into next year. I think you're absolutely right in terms of when inflation moderates in some of these markets, that will potentially lower the organic tenant billings growth from that perspective as well. So we'll be watching all of those issues. I think when it comes to LatAm, we'll be watching the churn as we go into next year. I can't tell you yet that we're beyond the peak here because of this churn that was delayed and potentially pushed into next year. But over the next couple of years, LatAm because of the reduction in inflation that could happen and the elevated churn, we could be in the low single digits in terms of organic tenant billings growth as we head into next year.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Great. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate it.\nRod Smith: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And next, we can go to Nick Del Deo with Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. And first of all, I want to echo others' comments and congratulate both Tom and Steve on the upcoming changes.\nTom Bartlett: All right. Thank you.\nNick Del Deo: Tom, just following up on the technology outlook you shared, is there any reason to believe that -- call it, the combination of the volume of spectrum that the carriers have been able to deploy and the capacity improvements enabled by 5G and massive MIMO, are going to allow them to stretch out their 5G upgrades over a longer period of time than may have been the case in the past, I think what you call the harvest phase of the 5G deployment or do you think those -- the impact of those improvements are just confident to what we've seen in the past with other technology upgrades?\nTom Bartlett: My sense is that they're more comparable with what we've seen in prior upgrades. Yeah. There are bigger swaps of spectrum in the market today that all of our customers are deploying, particularly in the mid-band. But the demand is disproportionate to what we've seen in the past. So my sense is that given the demand and the additional kind of usage that we would expect over the next several years, it will be very -- rarely, very, very consistent. The data intensity that I even talked about with regards to adding certain levels of video usage is really going to eat into a lot of that spectrum capacity that is out there. So as I said, there is definitely more spectrum out there, definitely more in the mid-band, but I would expect that the usage that we will see and experience over the next several years, we'll put it on the same path as what we've seen in 3G and 4G.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. And then maybe for Rod kind of a follow-up question on the dividend outlook. You noted that coming 2025, we should start to see the dividend grow at kind of in line with taxable income. I think historically, you had outlined sort of a 10% expectation. Should we think of your likely taxable income growth as being in that zone or is it going to be sort of a different level or is it just too early to say?\nRod Smith: I think, Nick, it -- we'll have to watch kind of the trajectory of the REIT taxable income. But in general, I think it's probably safe for you to assume that, that will be in line with all material respects with our AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth, that's probably a safe way to kind of think about it. It may not be exact all the time. But given the fact that we can't predict the future certain -- and certainly, we're not going to be guiding long term on that. If you think about where our AFFO and AFFO per share growth is going to be and you think about that being probably consistent with where re-taxable income might be and where the dividend growth could be. That's probably the safest bet. I'd just highlight again, we do have a requirement to dividend out 90% of our REIT taxable income. We typically dividend out closer to 100% because we think that's most beneficial to our shareholders from a tax perspective. So that's important to notice. But then, Tom, mentioned, there are other ways that we manage the dividend payout relative to REIT taxable income, and that's where there is a little bit more discretion on our end to try to match it up to AFFO growth. So that's probably the way to think about it. Think about what our AFFO growth is going to be over the long term, what our AFFO per share growth is going to be and a dividend growth very well may align with that. But with that said, we will be considering capital allocation and the best uses of capital for our shareholders each and every year and each and every quarter. And the dividend specifically, is approved by our Board each year in each quarter.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That's great. Thank you, Rod. And can I just -- one quick clarification on the one-time revenue benefits you called out. It looks like other was elevated in the U.S. in the quarter. I think that's really the Sprint payments. And any other one-timers that you would call out or be able to describe to us?\nRod Smith: The only thing it's really in the settlement area. I mean we had about -- I think it was about $50 million in settlements this quarter. Last year, same quarter was much lower, more in the $15 million range. There's a customer equipment removal settlement in the U.S. that was pulled forward from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, that was probably in the range of $25 million or so. But those are really the items. It's the one-time items, it's settlement fees. We get some small settlement fees throughout our other international markets and the timing of those can be somewhat bumpy. One thing you'll see from our guide is those settlement fees, those one-time items do drop off pretty substantially in Q4. So that's one of the things you can think about when you look at the bridge from Q3 to Q4 in terms of our AFFO, there will be a non-recurrence of close to $40 million, $45 million of those one-time items.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Tom ad Steve, I wish you all the best as well. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Rod, you mentioned that we'll end leverage at about 5.2, 5.3 at year-end. Where do you want that to be over the next year or two? And we will get specific guidance next year, but just directionally, do you expect AFFO to grow in '24, assuming India is sold at year-end? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Yeah. Hey, Batya. Nice to hear from you. Hope you are well. Yes, so we ended the quarter with 5.0 leverage. It's going to be a little higher than that at the end of the year, primarily driven because of those one-time items on the EBITDA side. But our clear focus is to delever to reduce debt as well as reduce our exposure to floating rate debt by driving the percentage of our debt that is exposed to floating rates, and we got that down to about 11% or so. Our goal is to get to 5 times really as soon as we can. And that's what we're focused on, and that's what's driving a lot of our capital allocation decisions is driving balance sheet strength and reducing leverage getting to that 5.0 as soon as we can. So that is clearly the goal. The goal will also -- the goal -- and it's specifically for 2024, that's where we hope to get to. And we're looking for all the opportunities we can find to drive that. And that could include reducing the capital program a little bit next year, that certainly is in line with the dividend decision that you heard us articulate today, you'll see that our SG&A is being held flat year-over-year. You'll see that our margins are expanding that's the result of a lot of global initiatives around operational efficiency to drive additional EBITDA and AFFO. Not only is that good for everyone. It also helps us get our leverage numbers down a little bit. It provides a little bit more cash flow to reduce the debt. So those are all the pieces that we're focused on. The short answer is 5 times as soon as possible. 5 times in 2024 would be great. That's possible, and we're driving towards that and we'll see if we can achieve it. And then with AFFO, I would absolutely say, our portfolio, consistent with the way we've explained this for years is really well positioned for durable AFFO per share growth. This year, that was interrupted primarily because of financing cost headwinds, driven by interest rates, additional shares that we issued for some of our prior acquisitions and some minority interest that we have because of some of the private capital that we raised in certain parts of our business. With our new AFFO per share outlook of around $9.79, we\u2019re pretty much flat with where we were prior year. So we\u2019ve been able to convert a 1% to 2% reduction in AFFO, AFFO per share up to closer to flat, which is good. But when you think about that number being flat and an 8% headwind from financing being embedded in it as well as a 2% headwind from VIL short payments or, let\u2019s say, the VIL reserve of $75 million we made, you adjust for those things, the underlying core operating performance of the assets that we own around the globe are driving double-digit growth without those headwinds. So we absolutely believe this business can drive growth over the long term and in 2024. The thing that we\u2019ll be watching that a potential interrupters would be any material volatility in FX. We don\u2019t know where rates will go. Rate uncertainty is something that we watch. But absent those sorts of items, we think the portfolio is well positioned to grow next year and over the long term.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nRod Smith: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'll hand the call back over to our team.\nAdam Smith: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me here at the Investor Relations team. Have a great day.\nOperator: And that does conclude the call for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. In Q3, we continued our trend of strong performance, driven by solid demand for our diverse global portfolio of assets. Against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we remain focused on delivering results and creating value by driving organic growth across our existing portfolio and demonstrating global operational efficiency and cost management in support of attractive margin expansion. At the same time, we are committed to strengthening our balance sheet by enhancing our liquidity extending our maturities, reducing floating rate debt volatility and making progress towards our leverage target. These efforts coupled with the evolving technological trends highlighted by Tom, remain key drivers of our current performance and give us confidence in our ability to drive sustained growth over the long term. Before delving into the specifics of our Q3 results and raised outlook, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we saw a continuation of solid trends across our global operations, driving consolidated property revenue growth of 7%, consolidated organic tenant billings growth in our tower business exceeded 6% for the third consecutive quarter and was complemented by over 9% revenue growth in our data center business. As a result of this strong performance and visibility extending through the end of 2023, we raised our full year expectations across nearly all segments, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Next, our keen focus on cost management resulted in conversion rates exceeding 100% and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 290 basis points year-over-year and still over 215 basis points when normalized for the prior year VIL revenue reserves, complementing our operational efforts. On the balance sheet side, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of approximately 5.9% by utilizing the proceeds to pay down revolver balances, we reduced our floating rate debt exposure to approximately $4 billion or less than 11% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the third quarter down from over 22% at the start of the year. Finally, we're making significant progress on the strategic review of our India business. As we are in the final stages of this process, we remain committed to communicating the outcome to our shareholders before the end of the year, consistent with our past messaging. In Q3, we recorded $322 million in goodwill impairment charges associated with our India business. This was prompted by indications of value obtained through the process conducted over the past several months, supported by our own interim goodwill impairment test. We believe this impairment accurately reflects the current market conditions, evolving risk premiums associated with operating in the India market and more generally increases in the cost of capital. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, consolidated property revenue growth was 7% or 8% on an FX neutral basis. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was over 5%, which includes a nearly 2% headwind associated with a reduction in straight-line revenue, offset by timing benefits associated with certain non-recurring one-time items in the quarter. International growth was nearly 9% or approximately 11% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which included a 4% benefit associated with the full collection of VIL billings in India in the quarter, as compared to the approximately $48 million revenue reserve in the prior year. Finally, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, our data center business revenue increased by over 9% and continues to demonstrate solid outperformance as compared to our initial underwriting plan. As Tom mentioned earlier, we anticipate 2023 to again break the signed new business record just set in 2022, setting up CoreSite to drive sustained attractive levels of growth as the backlog of new business commences over the next several years. Moving to the right side of the slide. Strong performance across each of our segments drove consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%. Within our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.3% and greater than 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of colocation and amendment contributions of nearly $60 million. Our International segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily driven by higher new business in Africa and churn delays in Latin America and APAC resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9%. Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 10% to $1.8 billion for the quarter or approximately 11% on an FX neutral basis. As I highlighted in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 64.4%, a 290 basis point improvement compared to the previous year, primarily driven by solid organic growth, effective cost management throughout the business and the one-time revenue items I mentioned. In fact, despite the current inflationary environment, we have managed to maintain a relatively flat year-over-year cash SG&A profile remaining consistent with the themes from the first half of the year, with cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue standing at approximately 6.5% for the quarter, a nearly 70 basis point improvement versus Q3 of 2022. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share each increased by over 9%, driven by solid cash adjusted EBITDA growth partially offset by an approximately 5% headwind from financing costs. Now shifting focus to our revised full year outlook. I'll start by highlighting a few key items. First, as a result of our strong performance in the third quarter and the momentum taking us through the end of the year, we've raised our guidance for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. Next, our revised outlook includes a reduction in U.S. services, resulting in a $20 million decrease in gross margin compared to our previous expectations for the year. As we've highlighted in the past, although, quarter-to-quarter variations in tower leasing activity have impacted our services revenue in 2023, our leasing revenue remains unaffected, underpinned by the comprehensive master lease agreements currently in place. Finally, the updated midpoints include revised FX assumptions that have resulted in outlook to outlook headwinds of approximately $28 million for property revenue, $14 million for adjusted EBITDA and $5 million for attributable AFFO. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $60 million as compared to our prior outlook. Our revised expectations are driven by $31 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with approximately $45 million and $12 million in additional pass-through and straight-line revenues, respectively. Our revised guidance includes $10 million in outperformance associated with VIL collections with roughly half included in our core property revenue and the balance in the pass-through outperformance illustrated. Growth was partially offset by $28 million of negative FX impacts. Turning to Slide 11. We are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth across nearly all segments. In the U.S. and Canada, we are increasing our guidance to greater than 5% or approximately 6.5% excluding Sprint churn, now with an expectation for approximately $230 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. Growth is further benefiting from non-Sprint related churn delays, which we now anticipate occurring in 2024. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from approximately 4% up now to approximately 5%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from greater than 11% to approximately 12%, primarily due to a continued uptick in colocation and amendment demand. In APAC, we are increasing our guidance from approximately 4% to about 5% supported by a combination of strong new business in delayed churn. Moving on to Slide 12. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $60 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue highlighted earlier, coupled with prudent cost controls, resulting in an incremental $67 million in cash property gross margin outperformance along with an additional $14 million in cash, SG&A savings and $30 million of straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $20 million associated with our U.S. services business and a negative FX impact of $14 million. Turning to Slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint or approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.79 per share. Our performance was driven by the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $61 million partially offset by $16 million of other items, including an acceleration of certain maintenance projects in cash taxes, along with incremental minority interest due to outperformance in our JV businesses, partially offset by improvements to net interest. As I noted earlier, FX caused a headwind of approximately $5 million. Moving on to Slide 14. Let's review our capital allocation plans for the full year. Consistent with the expectations set at the beginning of the year, we are planning to distribute approximately $3 billion in common stock dividends which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 10% on a per share basis, subject to board approval. Our full year CapEx spend also remains consistent at $1.7 billion with the acceleration of certain non-discretionary projects that I mentioned earlier, offset by lower discretionary spend, which includes a reduction in development CapEx associated with lower anticipated new build volumes. As always, our goal is to execute a capital deployment strategy that maximizes total shareholder returns. In line with my earlier remarks, we're focused on creating incremental value through solid organic growth and quality of earnings optimizing global operational efficiency and expanding cash margins, all while strengthening our financial position by further reducing balance sheet risk and enhancing financial flexibility. As it relates to capital allocation and against the current economic backdrop, we believe it's optimal to prioritize balance sheet strength and keep discretionary spend focused on select capital expenditure projects that yield the best risk-adjusted returns and quality of earnings. Additionally, decoupled from our current line of sight to its attributable AFFO growth for next year, we anticipate maintaining a dividend per share profile in 2024 that closely aligns with our 2023 expectation of $6.45 per share resuming growth in a manner supportive of our REIT taxable income thereafter, all subject to Board approval. By focusing on the above priorities, we believe American Tower is positioned for sustained and compelling total shareholder returns supported through balance sheet strength over the long term. Consistent with our historical practice, we'll discuss our 2024 plans in more detail on our next earnings call. Moving to the right side of the slide and as highlighted earlier, as a result of the successful execution of our financing initiatives in the third quarter, we reduced our floating rate debt balance to below 11%, increased our liquidity to $9.7 billion, and our average maturity remains over six years. We closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5 times, which benefits from certain non-recurring items in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect to close the year slightly above 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic and potentially further accessing the debt capital markets, ensuring continued strength in our balance sheet, reducing risk and enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 15, and in summary, our diverse portfolio of global communications assets continue to demonstrate resiliency in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, producing attractive growth through organic leasing, further amplified by exceptional cost management at the margin. Complementing our operational performance, we continue to make progress in strengthening and de-risking our balance sheet. Furthermore, we remain committed to managing our capital structure, sources and uses and capital allocation priorities in a manner that positions American Tower to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Yeah. Simon, good morning. Thanks for joining. I'll hit the leverage piece first, and then Tom will address the dividend more broadly. When you think about the leverage, we've been a little bit higher than our stated range. We've been up in the 5, 3 range. We did end this quarter at around 5.0 that was benefited from some non-recurring one-time revenue items. So we do expect that to tick back up towards the end of this year. And we expect to end this year, again, higher than our stated range of 3 to 5 times up in the 5.2%, 5.3% range. It is a priority of ours to bring that leverage down, along with driving organic growth operational efficiency, expanding margins, controlling the SG&A in the -- and ultimately, the AFFO and AFFO growth that we can drive. So the target is to get to 5.0 as soon as we can. We'll be working through that diligently next year. And a lot of these operational objectives around organic growth and driving AFFO as well as capital allocation, our capital plan, specifically you'll see a reduction -- you've seen a reduction in our capital plans this year versus last year. And that, again, is all in line with trying to drive down leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. We do think those are important steps to take to drive total shareholder return in the short term and the long term. So that's what it's really all about the dividend holding it flat next year is in line with that. I mean, I'll say, we believe that's the best use of capital in terms of strengthening the balance sheet in this time of uncertain rates. When it comes to M&A, we continue to not see compelling M&A opportunities in our pipeline. So it's not something that's hitting our radar screen in terms of capital allocation this year and we turn the corner into next year. Then I'll turn it over to Tom to hit and a little bit more directly. Sure. I'll take that one. So we're not going to give specific guidance for 2024 at this time, obviously. And I don't want to get into specific care activity levels because I want to leave it to them to talk about the rollout plans. But in general, we have seen activity levels moderate over the last several months from the recent highs. However, the visibility that we have into a baseline level of contractually guaranteed growth through these comprehensive MLAs allow us to reiterate our expectation that we're going to achieve an average annual OTBG growth rate of at least 5% in the U.S. and Canada segment between 2023 and 2027. And despite some of the concerns that people have in the market over the recent moderation we have visibility into a level of organic growth in 2024 that's supportive of that average. Now having said that, I want to break down the components a little bit, we do not have visibility into another year of $230 million growth from colocation and amendment activity. That's far away a record from American Tower. But we balance that with an expectation for some moderation in churn following 2023, excluding Sprint. Our MLAs do provide us visibility into a level of colocation and movement contributions that exceeds the average we've seen over the past several years. And again, it's supportive of that at least 5% average OTBG that we've guided to between 2023 and 2027. And to reiterate on our Sprint churn, the annual impacts of our Sprint churn have been $195 million in 2021, $60 million in 2022, and $50 million in 2023 and $70 million in 2024 for a total of $375 million. So we're past the peak of that churn, and there's no change to that cadence versus our prior guidance in that respect. It\u2019s a little over half at this point. Yeah, David. So let me hit the first part of your question. I think I missed a little bit of the second, so I may ask you to repeat that. But when you think about the upside in terms of the growth rates, let me hit it by addressing the organic tenant billings piece first-off. So we are seeing increases in organic tenant billings really across the board. So you can see in the charts, they were increasing our overall organic tenant billings for the company to about 6%, that's up about 50 basis points from prior. And that kind of -- that theme is consistent across many of the regions. So as Steve just highlighted in the U.S., we're bringing that guide to beyond 5% from what was previously around 5%. International is coming up to greater than 7%. Prior, we were at greater than 6.5%. And then you look at the different parts of the company region by region, LatAm is going up to about 5% versus what was previously a 4%. APAC is coming up to about 5%. Previously, it was 4%. Europe was staying around where it was at 8%. And then Africa is also coming up to around 12% from what was prior higher than 11%. A couple of things that I would say, in terms of the stay ability or the durability of some of that growth, certainly, in the U.S., it's nice strong performance. There is a little bit of delayed churn, so we can expect to see that hit next year. Other than that, the U.S. is very steady in terms of the demand. Part of that is because of the way the contracts we have work out. When you think of Latin America, we do have higher levels of churn this year than we have had in prior years. Some of the outperformance is churn driven. So when you think about the LatAm over performance, it's really a delay in churn and probably not all that durable from that perspective. When you get into APAC, it's a similar situation. The increase there is delayed churn, maybe some delayed discounts. Europe is staying in line. In Africa, we're seeing higher levels of new business activity. So much of that is, in fact, durable and lasting, that's the way I would kind of articulate that. And then maybe on the second question, if you could maybe just repeat the question about the dilution, just so I get it right. Yeah. That's good, David. Thank you. So we're making good progress with the strategic review that we've set out. In terms of the write-down, we are writing the India business down about $322 million and sets the book value in around $2.2 billion or so. And as I stated in my prepared remarks, it really is based on our internal impairment review analysis, discounted cash flow driven and certainly, cost of capital plays a significant role in that. But also, as I highlighted in my comments, it does also consider indications of value that we've determined throughout the process. So I think you can understand what that means, and it will help you kind of think about where things might fit. We've also provided a little bit more breakout on the India financials and some of -- in the back of the presentation, which you'll see. But in terms of revenue, we're a little over $1 billion EBITDA. It's about $355 million. Unlevered AFFO is about $290 million. So that gives you a little bit more information to kind of piece through and kind of assume where we may -- the way we may have. I don't want to get into too much direct guidance. We'll certainly lay that out when we complete our strategic review, which -- the good news is we're happy with the way the process is evolving. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be concluding it this year just as we\u2019ve previously mentioned, once we do, we\u2019ll let the investors know exactly what we\u2019ve concluded and what we plan to do there. We\u2019ve said that our goal, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our goals, which is to sell a majority equity stake to a financial investor. We\u2019ve said between 51% and 100%, the reality is it\u2019s probably going to be a majority stake. We probably will retain a stake, so it will be somewhere between that 61% and 100%. That\u2019s where we\u2019re kind of directing the process at this point. But again, we are confident that the process will conclude in the next couple of months. And when it does, we\u2019ll let the investors know exactly what we\u2019ve done. Thanks. Thanks, Rick. Yeah. I think at this point, think about it being flat year-on-year. So, of course, every quarter, we get the dividend approved by the Board. But our intention is to hold the dividend flat annually year-over-year to help support deleveraging balance sheet strength and ultimately, AFFO growth as well as total shareholder returns. Yeah. I guess, Rick, I would say that's not correct. The India business isn't in our REIT at this point. So it really doesn't drive into the retaxable income issue. I think Tom articulated all the drivers with that, which it's really -- this is a management decision and certainly supported by our Board to prioritize capital to prioritize deleveraging and balance sheet strength, it's not impacted by the India process at all. And Tom highlighted, there are certain REIT rules that allow one-time items in some pretax earnings to be moved from one period to another. So there have been times in the past where we've been over under distributed, and we can move some of that over or under distribution back and forth from year-to-year, which is helpful. So in this case, it really is a decision to drive balance sheet strength and using our capital in the best way we can again, to drive total shareholder return in the short term and in the long term. And in this market with uncertain interest rates going forward, we think that's prudent and that's really the driving factor. Yeah, Rick. I would -- let me highlight first that we don't see compelling M&A on our pipeline. I think everyone kind of knows that, I'll just reiterate that. We are seeing some things out there. Certainly, there is -- not as robust, but there is a market in the U.S. with some smaller portfolios. And I don't want to get into a lot of detail in terms of what we see. I think we still see very high prices, even though they may have pulled back slightly from where they were, let's say, a year ago. And for that, we still look at the small deals if we can find compelling ways to expand total shareholder return. We have a little flexibility there. We don't see anything major. But we also just see the majority of the deals are probably still priced a little higher than what today's cost of capital would suggest that they should be. The small acquisition you see in our numbers is really just a buyout of a prior SBC sublease, which you'll be familiar with. It was a small tranche. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. It's not the final one. It's just another tranche, and that will continue for a few more years. Yeah. I would say, Rick, we routinely review the portfolio performance across our business globally. We do that from a couple of perspectives. One is, there could be capital recycling opportunities, which we think could be very good for our shareholders over the long term, that certainly the decisions we saw driving our exit from the Mexico fiber business. It also is what is driving our consideration around what we're doing in India. So I'll highlight that, I don't want to get into specific other places where we might be looking. But we are looking at our portfolio, and it's something we do constantly. The other thing we do is, we constantly look at our capital deployments. And from that perspective, we can throttle those back or up depending on where the opportunities are. We can also reallocate or redistribute that capital to where we feel that investments will most -- will be most aligned with our priorities of driving organic growth in the short term and the long term, quality of earnings and consistent durable industry-leading AFFO growth and ultimately, total shareholder return. So I wouldn\u2019t just look at whether or not we sell a business here or there, those would be kind of operational decisions as well as recycling capital, but also kind of our CapEx programs, how much are we investing? Where are we investing? What kind of assets. And again, those decisions are made each and every year, really each and every quarter, and they are meant to and do align with our priorities. Yeah. And Matt, I'll just add a couple of data points. When you think about the co-location amendment additions. This year, we're anticipating a number of around $230 million for the U.S. You recall last year, we were around $150 million, we're at about $58 million this quarter and our guide anticipates a further reduction, but still a number that's greater than $50 million in Q4. I wouldn't just take that Q4 number and annualize. And I think you're better off and we won't give guidance, as Steve suggest until next year. But for modeling purposes, if you look at this year and last year and you split the difference, that's probably a safer place to put in your models today. And then, of course, we'll guide in February, and we'll be able to update that number. The only other thing I would say on services is the $140 million number is still higher than the historical average for services, and we're continuing to maintain a very nice gross margin in that business at all levels. So when we saw that go up to about $270 million, we were still in the 50s, low 50s, 53%, 54% margins as it tapered off a little bit to $140 million, we are able to drive up the margins based on the mix of the revenue and the way we service that revenue. So with a lower revenue, we\u2019re still able to mitigate some of that with higher margins in the upper 50s at this point. Yeah. Good morning, Eric. Thanks for joining in. And absolutely, all those issues are on the table. We look at our capital allocation every year, certainly, and I would say, even more frequently than that in the idea and the approach is to make the best decisions we can to support long-term total shareholder return. With the increase in cost of capital, the increase in interest rates as well as other factors affecting our markets around the globe, those all play into how much capital we will be deploying, how many build-to-suits will be executing on and where those will be. So that certainly comes into play. I won't get into a lot of detail in terms of decision-making there. I would just maybe highlight again that capital this year is lower than it was last year. And the environment in interest rates, in particular, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty. So we will be continuing to kind of look at that capital plan to decide if putting the capital into build-to-suits around the globe is better than some of the other options we have and a continuation of capital reductions is probably what you'll end up seeing in this environment. That's kind of where we're looking at it. The other part of your question is absolutely, we look at putting capital into places that primarily or specifically drive and align with our priorities. So when you think about us focused on organic growth over the long term, we're focused on quality of earnings. We're focused on operational efficiencies and driving balance sheet strength, all of the different ways that we can execute on achieving those goals are in play. If that means allocating more capital to higher quality markets versus emerging markets or vice versa. If it means putting less into CapEx and more into debt reduction, if it means reducing the growth of the dividend and putting more towards balance sheet and debt reduction. We think about those things all the time and it plays into our capital allocation and it will next year as well, and we'll lay out what that will mean in February. Yeah. A couple of things that I\u2019d \u2013 that I highlight relative to the LatAm market. I mean in 2022, we had roughly 5% churn that was part of embedded in our organic tenant billings growth. In Q3 here, it was 5.2%, so pretty consistent. For the full year of '23, we're projecting that to be around 6%. So that's what's driving. When we say elevated churn, that's exactly kind of what we're seeing there. We are seeing delays in churn. Much of that is tied to the oi churn (ph) that we're experiencing and will continue to experience down in Brazil. We also see churn from Telefonica up in Mexico. Those are kind of the two primary places where we see churn. We've laid out a lot of the different pieces of the oi churn. I won't do that again here. But I would say, we do expect elevated churn to continue into next year. I think you're absolutely right in terms of when inflation moderates in some of these markets, that will potentially lower the organic tenant billings growth from that perspective as well. So we'll be watching all of those issues. I think when it comes to LatAm, we'll be watching the churn as we go into next year. I can't tell you yet that we're beyond the peak here because of this churn that was delayed and potentially pushed into next year. But over the next couple of years, LatAm because of the reduction in inflation that could happen and the elevated churn, we could be in the low single digits in terms of organic tenant billings growth as we head into next year. You\u2019re welcome. I think, Nick, it -- we'll have to watch kind of the trajectory of the REIT taxable income. But in general, I think it's probably safe for you to assume that, that will be in line with all material respects with our AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth, that's probably a safe way to kind of think about it. It may not be exact all the time. But given the fact that we can't predict the future certain -- and certainly, we're not going to be guiding long term on that. If you think about where our AFFO and AFFO per share growth is going to be and you think about that being probably consistent with where re-taxable income might be and where the dividend growth could be. That's probably the safest bet. I'd just highlight again, we do have a requirement to dividend out 90% of our REIT taxable income. We typically dividend out closer to 100% because we think that's most beneficial to our shareholders from a tax perspective. So that's important to notice. But then, Tom, mentioned, there are other ways that we manage the dividend payout relative to REIT taxable income, and that's where there is a little bit more discretion on our end to try to match it up to AFFO growth. So that's probably the way to think about it. Think about what our AFFO growth is going to be over the long term, what our AFFO per share growth is going to be and a dividend growth very well may align with that. But with that said, we will be considering capital allocation and the best uses of capital for our shareholders each and every year and each and every quarter. And the dividend specifically, is approved by our Board each year in each quarter. The only thing it's really in the settlement area. I mean we had about -- I think it was about $50 million in settlements this quarter. Last year, same quarter was much lower, more in the $15 million range. There's a customer equipment removal settlement in the U.S. that was pulled forward from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, that was probably in the range of $25 million or so. But those are really the items. It's the one-time items, it's settlement fees. We get some small settlement fees throughout our other international markets and the timing of those can be somewhat bumpy. One thing you'll see from our guide is those settlement fees, those one-time items do drop off pretty substantially in Q4. So that's one of the things you can think about when you look at the bridge from Q3 to Q4 in terms of our AFFO, there will be a non-recurrence of close to $40 million, $45 million of those one-time items. Yeah. Hey, Batya. Nice to hear from you. Hope you are well. Yes, so we ended the quarter with 5.0 leverage. It's going to be a little higher than that at the end of the year, primarily driven because of those one-time items on the EBITDA side. But our clear focus is to delever to reduce debt as well as reduce our exposure to floating rate debt by driving the percentage of our debt that is exposed to floating rates, and we got that down to about 11% or so. Our goal is to get to 5 times really as soon as we can. And that's what we're focused on, and that's what's driving a lot of our capital allocation decisions is driving balance sheet strength and reducing leverage getting to that 5.0 as soon as we can. So that is clearly the goal. The goal will also -- the goal -- and it's specifically for 2024, that's where we hope to get to. And we're looking for all the opportunities we can find to drive that. And that could include reducing the capital program a little bit next year, that certainly is in line with the dividend decision that you heard us articulate today, you'll see that our SG&A is being held flat year-over-year. You'll see that our margins are expanding that's the result of a lot of global initiatives around operational efficiency to drive additional EBITDA and AFFO. Not only is that good for everyone. It also helps us get our leverage numbers down a little bit. It provides a little bit more cash flow to reduce the debt. So those are all the pieces that we're focused on. The short answer is 5 times as soon as possible. 5 times in 2024 would be great. That's possible, and we're driving towards that and we'll see if we can achieve it. And then with AFFO, I would absolutely say, our portfolio, consistent with the way we've explained this for years is really well positioned for durable AFFO per share growth. This year, that was interrupted primarily because of financing cost headwinds, driven by interest rates, additional shares that we issued for some of our prior acquisitions and some minority interest that we have because of some of the private capital that we raised in certain parts of our business. With our new AFFO per share outlook of around $9.79, we\u2019re pretty much flat with where we were prior year. So we\u2019ve been able to convert a 1% to 2% reduction in AFFO, AFFO per share up to closer to flat, which is good. But when you think about that number being flat and an 8% headwind from financing being embedded in it as well as a 2% headwind from VIL short payments or, let\u2019s say, the VIL reserve of $75 million we made, you adjust for those things, the underlying core operating performance of the assets that we own around the globe are driving double-digit growth without those headwinds. So we absolutely believe this business can drive growth over the long term and in 2024. The thing that we\u2019ll be watching that a potential interrupters would be any material volatility in FX. We don\u2019t know where rates will go. Rate uncertainty is something that we watch. But absent those sorts of items, we think the portfolio is well positioned to grow next year and over the long term. You\u2019re welcome."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. And my focus for today's call will be on the technology trends and network investments that drive demand for our leading tower and data center platforms as well as the developments we're seeing at the edge. While my comments will largely be focused on the 5G evolution and the progress we're seeing in the United States, we believe similar trends will prevail across our international footprint as they have historically. Beginning with our macro tower business, the fundamental factor that drives demand for our global power portfolio, growth in mobile data consumption continues unabated. This is true both in the United States and across the globe, where mobile network data traffic has almost doubled over the last two years alone to a staggering 126 exabytes per month. Looking out over the next five years, forecasted growth in data traffic per device remains compelling as more spectrum for 5G networks will be deployed at scale. Average monthly data usage per smartphone across our key developed markets like the U.S., Germany and Spain is expected to grow at a healthy compounded annual rate of 18% between 2023 and 2028. And I would note that these estimates have been somewhat conservative historically. So let's spend a moment on where we are in the 5G investment cycle in the U.S. and where we believe we're going over the next several years. Just as we saw with the 3G and 4G rollouts, we expect the 5G investment cycle to play out in three phases that represent discrete business cases for the carriers and these three phases will drive two peak periods of spend that are bridged by a temporary phase of more moderate activity. The first phase is coverage-driven and aimed at upgrading existing infrastructure with new spectrum bands and radio technology, its competition to provide broad nationwide coverage with the new G ramps up. At the same time, carriers are looking to realize the efficiency benefits of their investments in new software, hardware and upgraded user devices. Initial equipment upgrades and new spectrum deployment quickly deliver reduced cost per gigabyte resulting in the ability to maintain margin profiles. Absent this migration, any incremental investments in the prior generation would be expected to result in significantly diminished returns as the additional densification required to sustain increasing network traffic on existing spectrum bands would be cost prohibitive. As the cadence of initial coverage investments begin to moderate from record spend of over $40 billion in 2022, the first peak of the 5G cycle, we retain a high degree of conviction that there's a long tail of network investment to come. This belief is predicated on several factors, including our experience with past investment cycles, industry forecast for growth in mobile data consumption that apply a necessity for significant incremental coverage and capacity and the visibility into network needs, we get through our contract structures. Today, Phase 1 of the 5G rollout is winding down and we're heading into a second phase. We expect Phase 2 to be characterized by carriers beginning to harvest the network efficiency benefits of their initial investments, while moderating spend from the record levels of 2022 to roughly $35 billion in 2023, which is $5 billion in excess of 4G averages, representing the second highest level of annual spend on record. In this next phase, we will begin to see a seeping in of 5G technology across the wireless and enterprise landscape. For example, 5G smartphone penetration has now surpassed the 50% mark in North America, which will ultimately allow for the majority of network traffic to shift over to 5G networks which we would expect to occur in the 2025 time frame. We're also looking forward to the emergence of more ubiquitous accessibility of stand-alone 5G core networks, which will unlock improved 5G network quality, higher speeds and lower latency and provide a platform for the development of innovative services and consumer applications. Finally, we anticipate that the arrival of end-to-end 5G capabilities will facilitate additional monetization opportunities at the enterprise level through use cases like private networks, network slicing and other IoT services that are beginning to emerge today. Ultimately, these dynamics will culminate in a third capacity focused phase aimed at significant densification of 5G networks. We continue to believe that 5G will advance and enable the next generation of mass market consumer use cases, particularly once 3GPP-released 17 and 18 are in the market, coupled with 5G cores that provide the true benefits of the end-to-end technology upgrade at scale. That said, meeting industry forecasts for growth in mobile data consumption that will drive the need for substantial network capacity investments seems highly achievable when taking into account the technology we have at our fingertips today. In fact, industry estimates already show that 5G subscribers are consuming 2 times to 3 times more mobile data than the average 4G subscriber. So let's take the case of mobile video consumption, which has consistently shown to be a dominant use case across subscriber usage types. As you can see on Slide 6, today the average smartphone subscriber in North America utilizes roughly 21 gigabytes of mobile data per month, and this is expected to grow to about 48 gigabytes by 2028. Of the 21 gigabytes consumed today, the majority or approximately 19 gigabytes are attributed to video streaming, which corresponds to a little over an hour of daily video usage and 360 and 480 pixel videos currently make up around half of that time. So by simply assuming a modest level of incremental usage towards higher resolution streaming such as 8 minutes of 4K Ultra HD, we would see video consumption alone drive usage to the forecasted 48 gigabytes per month or approximately 2.3 times the current rate. Furthermore, the data already shows that 5G is driving increased usage of higher resolution video formats. A recent report from Ericsson found that since 2021, 5G users report a nearly 50% increase in time spent on enhanced video formats. For example, among that user base, usage of new video formats like 360 degree videos and multi-view streaming have increased by an average of 10 minutes and 15 minutes per day, respectively, while time spent streaming videos and standard resolution has decreased by 23 minutes over the same period. In short, we've already seen 5G adoption linked with a shift in behavior towards using more data intensive applications, a trend we firmly believe will continue going forward. And while we remain confident that new low latency, high bandwidth consumer applications will be born as 5G standalone networks are deployed at scale, we see a highly tangible case for densification requirements from where we stand today. With that, I'll briefly provide an update on CoreSite in our data center segment before shifting to the progress we're making at the edge. The case remains that demand in CoreSite's interconnection centric business is exceeding our initial expectations. Our teams delivered record signed new business in 2022, a record we are targeting to exceed in 2023. We've also seen consistent elevated growth in interconnection revenue, mark-to-market pricing increases that exceed our historical averages, low churn and ongoing performance that we believe positions us to deliver compelling results in the segment for many years to come. And much like we see in our tower business, the secular trends that underpin the business model like the migration of workloads from on-prem to hybrid multi-cloud environments and the emergence of AI use cases that will drive more demand in our ecosystem continue on a path toward long-term acceleration. For example, findings from our recent 2023 state of the data center report showed that 94% of IT leaders noted that native direct connection between co-location data centers, major cloud providers, which CoreSite provides is essential for improved performance, enhanced security, cost savings and hybrid cloud connectivity. Further, 92% of IT leaders are considering moving critical workloads from public cloud to colocation to accelerate revenue growth and support the increasing need for AI and machine learning applications. In this context, we continue to upgrade our offerings and capabilities within the business to support emerging use cases. For example, earlier this month, we launched new capabilities on our OCX, our pioneering software defined networking platform, enabling clients to rapidly create higher bandwidth virtual connections to Google Cloud and AWS Direct Connect and between CoreSite data centers, including 50 gigabit services. These upgrades reduce the time required for organizations to augment network capacity to support high bandwidth, low latency hybrid applications like AI, machine learning and digital media production. When it comes to current and future AI and machine learning applications, CoreSite's flexible, purpose-built design data centers position us to host power-intensive GPU services being used for AI and ML use cases. For example, we're already providing GPU capacity for applications like 3D visualization and rendering and for software development with a niche cloud environment. And for the densest AI applications, our purpose built facilities are designed to accommodate liquid cooling with modest development efforts when required. As we've stated previously, in the near term, we continue to believe the majority of today's generative AI workloads will provide hyperscale opportunities that don't meet our investment criteria or fit within the CoreSite ecosystem. However, as GEN AI evolves, we would expect the balance of workloads to shift from large language model development, intensive training and public prompts to specialized inference-based use cases as productivity gains from the deployment of custom models accelerates. At this stage, when low latency interconnection high power density and distributed high performance compute become the priorities, we believe CoreSite and ultimately, our distributed portfolio of franchise real estate assets across the U.S. are going to be optimally positioned to benefit. On that note, we've continued to see progress toward the realization of demand cases that support our initial edge thesis, and we believe we have an opportunity to enable a more efficient exchange of network traffic and support cloud services and peering in a more distributed manner. As a result, we've been working both internally and with external stakeholders to develop an edge model we can execute on as compelling opportunities present themselves. In our initial assumption that through CoreSite, our seat at the table and visibility into the customer demand environment would be materially enhanced is holding true. We're increasingly seeing interest from potential customers looking to extend technologies such as private cloud computing AI and 5G applications closer to the end device through a more distributed architecture. This is resulting from several key demand cases including availability of future power requirements, business efficiency, revenue generation opportunities and customer experience. When it comes to power, CoreSite has secured significant future power availability and is insulated from expected shortages in markets like Northern Virginia. However, power constraints in general are increasingly in focus in legacy data center markets. In this case, we believe our distributed land footprint in Tier 2 and 3 markets with significant power availability and capability to connect back to CoreSite campuses can serve more distributed power capacity needs, while enabling customers to enjoy the interconnection benefits of the CoreSite ecosystem. And as potential customers increasingly focus on new revenue opportunities and customer experience including through the proliferation of applications like next-generation gaming, AR and devices and wearables that leverage interactive AI, we believe we have a compelling combination of distributed points of presence and interconnection capabilities that can be extended to a broader edge. In addition, by prioritizing our existing owned real estate, which in many cases is already designated for use as digital infrastructure, we see an opportunity to drive a significant time to market advantage and reduce overall development costs, which could be compelling to customers and enhance returns on investment. As a result of these factors, we continue to work towards establishing a repeatable, rapidly deployable design with initial capacity in the 1 megawatt range, which could then be scalable to incremental megawatts with interconnection to multisite campuses as demand dictates. As always, we'll assess potential growth at the edge through the prism of our disciplined capital allocation framework committing capital only if the opportunity meets our investment criteria and aligns with our long-term strategic vision of growing our interconnection ecosystem in a way that maximizes shareholder value. In closing, the bottom line is that we remain at the relatively early stages of a 5G and network technology evolution that we believe will necessitate continuous incremental investment in existing infrastructure like towers, data centers and distributed edge infrastructure. We also believe that ongoing technology developments will unlock new capabilities that will drive the next wave of innovative and data intensive consumer and enterprise devices and applications. And American Tower, with its leading tower portfolio and real estate footprint combined with a highly interconnected data center ecosystem is in a truly differentiated position to serve the network infrastructure needs of the future. Before I hand the call over to Rod, I'd like to close my remarks by congratulating Steve Vondran, who effective November 1 will hold the role of Global Chief Operating Officer until February 1 of next year, at which point he'll transition to the position of Chief Executive Officer; and Bud Noel, who will become our new Executive Vice President and President of our U.S. Tower Division. The Board and I have worked diligently on succession planning weighing the merits of an external search against the talent we have within our organization. Steve joined American Tower in 2000 and currently serves as the Executive Vice President of our U.S. and Canada business, including both towers and data centers. For the past 23 years, Steve has been instrumental to the growth and sustainability of earnings from American Tower and has built tremendous credibility with our global organization his peers, the Board of Directors, the American Tower investor base and our customers. All this to say, Steve is a clear candidate to lead American Tower in its next growth phase. And over the next several months, I'll work closely with Steve, the executive leadership team and the Board to ensure a seamless transition. Lastly, I want to thank all of the incredible American Tower employees around the world both past and present, our customers and investors for their support and confidence you've demonstrated since I joined in 2009. Although, this is a difficult decision on my part, I look forward to the time ahead with family and friends and new challenges, while watching the company under Steve's leadership continue to succeed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to review our latest results and updated outlook. Rod? First of all, Simon, thanks for your kind words. But maybe with regards to the dividend, it's important just to just take a step back and understand how we really manage this dividend growth. Since we became a REIT over a decade ago back in 2012, we've always looked to complement AFFO growth with a compelling yield, which we've grown, as you all know, around 20% annually as compared to our AFFO per share growth, which has been closer to 10% over that same time period. We've aligned our distribution with REIT taxable income, as you would expect. And within REIT AI you do have a recurring run rate and more of one-time buckets, consistent of things like earnings and profits, settlements, throwbacks NOLs, which we used last decade, much of which is discretionary in the planning that are absolutely separate from AFFO. And these tools allow us for to manage a more predictable glide path on our dividend. So here we are in 2023, we're committed to a 10% dividend growth rate which, like other years, consisted of certain one-time items to manage the dividend path and ensure alignment between our distribution and REIT AI. And so although our recurring REIT AI bucket was negatively impacted by interest rates, we utilize certain one-time items to manage towards the distribution. And absent those items, like most years, we'd be overdistributed. So as we look ahead to '24, we see an opportunity to accelerate our glide path and reset REIT AI closer to the run rate, which means temporarily relatively flat dividends per share in '24 decoupled from our expectations for AFFO growth based on our line of sight today. So our priorities that Rod just laid out really remain on maximizing our total shareholder returns. And we see the optimal path to do so, really centered around strengthening and de-risking our balance sheet, which means, in part, reducing our debt balance and advancing our pathway to sub 5 times net leverage and with that, more financial flexibility. And we view the levers to accelerate this path through maximizing organic growth, reducing our cost base as we've done in '23 and will continue to do in '24 with disciplined capital allocation that Rod just referred to, together with managing the dividend in a relatively flat basis before resuming growth in line with our recurring REIT AI thereafter. So this isn't a decision we take lightly, as you would expect. But given the current macro volatility, we believe that the balance sheet strength and accelerating financial flexibility for future opportunities, which could include buybacks is the optimal approach from where we sit today. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense, at least in terms of how we're thinking about it and how it fits into our overall plans for creating value long term. Yes. We got a long answer. My hairline has received more than years And Mike, I would just add just to make it clear, the delays in churn that we're seeing in the U.S. is not Sprint related. It's other items that we were planning that could be moved out a bit, as Steve is saying the Sprint cadence has not changed. And when you think about next year 2024 in our long-term guide, it's unlikely that there's going to be material upside based on where we sit today. We do think there's potential for upside in the longer-term growth rates, but that would probably come in '26 and '27 and down the line, not necessarily in '24. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Dave. Absolutely. You set up the table for us at the NAREIT conference, Rick, I remember that. Thanks, Rick. Sure. I'll start out and then, if you want to jump in, Rod. In terms of our service business, it's inherently a non-run rate business, and that makes it difficult to predict. And you saw that in 2021 when we raised our guide materially over a couple of quarters, we're seeing that this year as we've seen a moderation of activity. What I would say is because of our cooperative MLAs, that's not a direct read across to our property revenue, because we are somewhat insulated from the peaks and valleys of activity with the customers on that. And it's too early to be giving guidance for 2024 and where we see the activity levels going there. What I would just reiterate is this is consistent with what we've seen in other Gs of activity. And the carriers have an initial build phase that starts out with kind of a [indiscernible] of activity, and you'll see that moderate a little bit. We are seeing the capital spend moderate a bit, but it's still settling at levels higher than it was in 4G. And even with our reduced expectations this year for our services business, it's still higher than it was at the same point in 4G. So we're very optimistic that customers will continue to build throughout the cadence of this 5G build. There will be a restart of that activity. We don't know exactly when that's going to happen and we'll give better guidance on that in February as we get more visibility into 2024, what those activity levels are going to be. You\u2019re welcome. All right. Thank you. My sense is that they're more comparable with what we've seen in prior upgrades. Yeah. There are bigger swaps of spectrum in the market today that all of our customers are deploying, particularly in the mid-band. But the demand is disproportionate to what we've seen in the past. So my sense is that given the demand and the additional kind of usage that we would expect over the next several years, it will be very -- rarely, very, very consistent. The data intensity that I even talked about with regards to adding certain levels of video usage is really going to eat into a lot of that spectrum capacity that is out there. So as I said, there is definitely more spectrum out there, definitely more in the mid-band, but I would expect that the usage that we will see and experience over the next several years, we'll put it on the same path as what we've seen in 3G and 4G."

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks Adam and thanks to everyone for joining this morning\u2019s call. Consistent with our past practice my comments today will focus on our international segment which consists of a well-diversified, high growth portfolio of assets across key developed and emerging geographies outside of the United States. Before diving into our international operations though and in light of the recent excitement surrounding the potential arising from AI workloads, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting the demand we're seeing in our CoreSite data center business, where we've seen 9% year-over-year growth, in both revenue and operating profit for the first six months of the year. Following record levels of signing new business in 2022 and Q1 of 2023, we continue to see demand for data centers outstripping supply in our initial underwriting expectations, elevated pre-leasing in a pipeline that points to an extended opportunity for increasingly profitable growth.  Each of these factors is contributing to strong pricing trends, and the ability to be selective in terms of signing new logos and expansions from existing customers, ensuring accretion to the value of the interconnection ecosystem and overall AFFO growth, particularly once we begin commencing the remainder of the record new business we've signed over the last year and a half. This is all before factoring in expectations for elevated demand from AI used cases. While much of the immediate demand in the market today is coming from hyper scale requirements, the longer term opportunity for interconnection hub like CoreSite, is just as significant and is arising from several key demand drivers.  First, we've already seen an acceleration in outsourcing to CoreSite as hybrid IT and multi cloud access are becoming more relevant for continued digital transformation across all workloads. As enterprises increasingly leverage new generative AI models for business and customer applications, they'll need to deploy servers that require more power and cooling than on premises data centers can typically handle. At the same time, we expect existing enterprise customers who are building AI into their products and operating models will expand their power and space requirements in CoreSite with its flexible and scalable model and speed to market benefits, is already well positioned to support these expected used cases today.  Second, we're seeing today's cloud enabled large language models requiring connections to proprietary distributed datasets use for training, which CoreSite as an interconnection ecosystem with a nationwide distribution of cloud on-ramps is well situated to serve. And finally we see a significant incremental opportunity arising from the use of hybrid and custom large language models for training and inferencing where low latency, high power density and distributed high performance compute is expected to result in elevated activity across our existing CoreSite campus footprint. Over time, we see a potential for these dynamic requirements to push demand for a more distributed compute infrastructure for which our CoreSite portfolio and ultimately our distributed footprint of land parcels on the Tower sites may be ideal locations over the long-term.  Simply put, the ongoing demand trends in the data center space and the emergence of generative AI used cases are providing American Tower from CoreSite an opportunity to play a central role as an infrastructure provider against a backdrop of technology evolution that's expected to drive a step up function increasing computing power demand. As a result, we see a compelling opportunity to continue delivering the industry leading yields on invested capital that CoreSite has historically achieved which Rod will touch on more later.  With that, let's turn to our international Tower business, where our objectives have remained clear, since we began expansion over two decades ago, leverage our proven capabilities and expertise to selectively invest in the world's largest free market democracies with regulatory structures that are supportive of the neutral host tower model, healthy competitive wireless industries, and high quality assets and counterparties. At the same time we focused on investing in markets that are in various stages of network technology development, and where we see a path to establishing nationwide scale. By bringing these factors together, we believe we could both augment and extend our growth trajectory, leverage our platform and expertise to create incremental value in selected markets, and add to an already compelling total return profile for American Tower shareholders.  As a critical component of this portfolio management and capital allocation program, we measure and analyze our assets on an ongoing basis to ensure the marriage identified and our initial investment underwriting remained consistent today. As you've seen recently, such evaluation has led to select divestitures including our Mexico fiber business and operations in Poland and a strategic review of our India business. The takeaways from these analyses together with our on the ground experiences across our global business continue to shape and evolve our approach to capital allocation. And the criteria we use to support ongoing capital investment and the setting of appropriate risk adjusted rates of return.  Today, we have a leading international portfolio of nearly 183,000 sites that are contributing approximately 45% and 36% towards consolidated property revenues and operating profit respectively, and are expected to deliver more than 8.5% in total tenant billings growth, including greater than a 6.5% organic growth in 2023. The secular demand trends driving our international growth remained consistent. Similar to the U.S., industry estimates forecasts roughly $35 billion in carrier CAPEX across our non-U.S. markets in 2023 and forecast suggest mobile data consumption is set to grow in the 20% to 30% range on average in these markets over the next several years, which would mark a continuation of the trends we've seen over the better part of the last two decades.  Globally, we've anchored our portfolio in key markets, which are in varying stages of network development relative to that of the U.S., where some level of 5G coverage deployed over a combination of low and mid band spectrum has reached approximately 95% of the population. In Europe, that number is closer to 60%, while Africa and Latin America are closer to 7% to 8%, suggesting a long tail of 5G and other next generation technology investments requiring significant incremental network density and sell side points of presence. Critical to our expansion strategy has been our discipline in establishing appropriate contract structures with the leading M&A [ph] in each geography. Although we've experienced certain consolidation driven churn events across our international portfolios over the past several years, we believe that through our proactive steps to increase exposure to leading multinational counterparties, we strategically reset our international customer base, enhancing the quality of our earnings and predictability of growth.  In fact, in Africa, approximately 90% of our Q2 property revenues are derived by market leaders Airtel, MTN, Vodafone, and Orange, as compared to roughly 80%, five years ago. In Europe, we similarly see over 80% of property revenue supported by Telefonica, Orange, Vodafone, and Deutsche Telekom versus less than 60% at the same time in 2018. In Latin America, which has a more fragmented customer base, given our operations across eight markets, we're still generating approximately 75% of our property revenues from Telefonica, At&T, American mobile, and Tim, up from a little over 60% over the same time period.  In addition to focusing on partnerships with market leaders, we've underwritten attractive leasing terms, including real estate REITs, and CPI linked escalators in the vast majority of our contracts outside of India. This disciplined approach to securing growth and critical contract terms is evident in our results in Q2, with a combination of gross organic new business and our escalator generated just under 13.5% growth in aggregate for Latin America, Europe, and Africa, roughly 300 basis points over our trailing five-year average. This reflects our ability to complement new site leasing with attractive amendment growth across our international operations, as we've done in the U.S. historically. In fact, looking again at Latin America, Europe, and Africa, of the roughly $100 million we've generated through colocation and amendment growth over the past 12 months, around half, both in each region and in the aggregate has come in the form of amendments, illustrating our ability to monetize various stages of network investment cycles, and our success in franchising our proven U.S. tower model throughout our global operations.  There's perhaps no better example of the benefits of remaining disciplined in terms of contract structure in Europe, where over the last several quarters, CPI linked escalators in Germany and Spain have provided a boost to our organic growth profile. And where again, roughly half of our new business growth has been driven by 5G related amendment activity on existing sites. In 2023, these factors as well as a healthy leasing environment are coming together to derive an expectation of approximately 8% organic kind of Billings growth in Europe, including an expectation for an acceleration in growth from colocations as we exit the year. As the 5G investment cycle continues our contract structures along with our work to develop leading operating capabilities in the region, and an ongoing expectation for low churn should allow us to deliver solid organic growth in the region for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the importance of the scale we built as a distinct competitive advantage has never been clear.  To our global diversified presence, and decades long track record of operational excellence, we've established American Tower as a trusted, strategic partner for our customers. This is exemplified by our new build program, where we partnered with leading carriers to rapidly deploy new sites, which has driven some of our highest returns on invested capital. In fact, since we began expanding internationally, we have built over 45,000 international sites, which are achieving a NOI yield of approximately 25%. And approximately 65% of these sites have been built since the start of 2017 alone shortly after we crossed the 100,000 international site mark. Nearly 8000 of these sites have been built in Africa, where our scale presence and strategic relationships with key wireless operators have afforded us the opportunity to build several 1000 new sites in recent years, that typically deliver mid teen yields on day one.  As we continue to augment our scale in key markets across the region, 4G investments, which are very much in the middle innings today are driving compelling organic tenant billings growth and our existing assets, including an expectation for greater than 11% growth in 2023, of which approximately 7% is coming from colocation and amendments, the highest of any region. And as the 4G cycle rounds out over the next few years, and we move toward 5G and the densification requirements that come with it, we expect capacity utilization across the assets we've built over the last several years to result in ongoing compelling growth.  Meanwhile, our regional scale and leading capabilities have resulted in the opportunity to invest in accretive platform extensions, such as our power as a service program in Africa. As you'll see in our recently published sustainability report, through 2022 we've invested approximately $345 million in this program, primarily in solar arrays and lithium ion battery solutions. As a result, we decreased annual diesel consumption at our sites in the region by an estimated 43.5 million liters when compared to business as usual operations and we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per tower by 21%, against our 2019 baseline. Based on the demand to extend this program, it seems clear that this solution provides compelling differentiated value to our customers.  At the same time, the program advances our progress toward meeting our science based targets and supports our customers network sustainability goals. Meanwhile, similar to our new build program, these investments have been among the highest return opportunities we've seen. And as more power intensive 5G begins to be deployed at scale more broadly, we believe we'll be well positioned to continue extending the reach of this high return program to new geographies over time. Finally, we're more focused than ever, on leveraging the benefits of our scale to maximize the margin profile of the business. For example, through our Global Business Services Organization, we've invested in standardization across lease management and other transactional processes that's driving both significant increase in productivity and run rate savings on an annual basis. Through our procurement organization we will begin to truly leverage our scale as a buyer to reduce input costs in our build to suit programs. Drive cost optimization when it comes to power and energy components and work with other critical vendors in our supply chain to realize incremental efficiencies. And while we're beginning to see the benefits of these and many other initiatives in our operations today, we believe we have a significant opportunity to transform our organization into one that is truly global, and capable of maximizing the operating leverage inherent to the business to expand on an already attractive margin profile.  In summary, we believe our global platform of assets is exceptionally positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a massive wave of incremental infrastructure demand required to support the technological advancements and network capabilities we're beginning to see in the market today. By complementing our U.S. platform, with a continued disciplined approach to international growth, and a focus on leveraging our scale, capabilities and learnings from over two decades of international U.S. operations we can provide compelling growth and margin expansion, and augmented return opportunity for investors, and a differentiated value proposition for our customers for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to go through the quarterly results and updated outlook.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong second quarter reflecting a continuation of resilient demand for our diversified global portfolio, and solid operational execution across our organization. Before I walk through the details of our Q2 results, and revised full year outlook, I'll start with highlighting a few items from the quarter. First, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, raising approximately $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt through a combination of Euro and U.S. dollar denominated senior notes at a weighted average cost of 4.9%. As a result, we decreased our exposure to floating rate debt to approximately $6 billion or less than 15% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the second quarter.  Next, the momentum experienced across our global business in Q1 continued into the second quarter with outperformance across new business, escalations and churn, resulting in another quarter of over 6% organic tenant billings growth, allowing us to raise our full year expectations across our Latin America, Europe, and Africa segments. We also had another strong quarter at CoreSite where elevated leasing volumes since our acquisition continued into Q2, and were further supported by solid pricing trends, high renewal rates, and interconnection growth of approximately 10%, which together with our tower business drove property revenue growth of over 4% in the quarter. Complementing top line growth, and as I highlighted last quarter, we are maintaining a strong focus on cost management. Once again in Q2, despite an elevated inflationary environment, we kept cash SG&A roughly flat year-over-year, helping to support an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points to 63.1% or over 100 basis points when normalizing for VIL reserves. Finally, we continue to engage in active discussions with a focused group of investors around the potential sale of a majority equity interest in our India business as we assess strategic options in the market, and exercise we anticipate completing in the second half of the year. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient with the goal of achieving the best outcome for American Tower and its shareholders. With that, please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, Q2 consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth was over 4% or over 6% on an FX neutral basis. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 5%, international growth of nearly 3%, or over 7%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and over 7% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter we recognized approximately $35 million in revenue reserves associated with VIL short payments, as collection patterns in Q2 were relatively consistent with that of Q1. Moving to the right side of the slide, we achieved another strong quarter of organic tenant billings growth, which stood at 6.2% on a consolidated basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and approximately 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of elevated colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million. Our international segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily due to a combination of higher than anticipated colocation and amendment growth and continued churn delays, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9% up from 7.5% in Q1. At a segment level, Africa, Europe, and APAC produce growth of 12.9%, 8.3%, and 5.6% respectively, each in acceleration off of Q1, with Africa representing a record for the region, APAC delivering its highest quarter since Q3 of 2017, and Europe demonstrating growth of over 575 basis points above its pre-Telsius [ph] average. In Latin America, we did see a modest deceleration of 5.4% as expected. Consistent with the last quarter, we continued to realize benefits associated with CPI linked escalators across the vast majority of our international markets while a continued delay in anticipated consolidation driven churn in Latin America has kept reported churn favorable to our initial expectations through the first half of the year.  Finally, strong leasing trends across our international business has driven an acceleration in colocation and amendment growth contributions across nearly all of our segments, resulting in an approximately 40 basis point improvement sequentially at a consolidated international level. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of more than 565 sites with virtually all of the step down relative to Q1 associated with India volumes, as we continue to prioritize capital deployments across our footprint to projects that demonstrate the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return.  Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 5% to over $1.7 billion or approximately 6% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 63.1% driven by elevated organic growth, combined with prudent cost controls throughout the business, which allowed for a conversion of over 85% of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth, again, on a normalized VIL basis. Cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 6.8%, and over 20 basis point improvement compared to prior year. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share decreased by less than 1% and approximately 2%, respectively. This decline includes financing cost headwinds of approximately 7% and 9% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, driven by the rise in interest rates over the past year.  Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, as mentioned earlier, we had a solid second quarter, and the core performance of the business continues to remain strong supporting an increase to our expectations for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share. Next, consistent with our prior outlook, we have maintained our VIL revenue reserve assumption of $75 million for the year. As I noted, we saw similar collection trends in the second quarter as compared to Q1 bringing our year-to-date reserves associated with VIL to approximately $70 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, VIL made a full payment for July's billings and has committed to paying at least 100% of billings moving forward. In this case, we could potentially see some upside to our outlook assumption. However, we believe it is prudent to leave the full year assumption unchanged at this time.  Additionally, we have assumed lower U.S. services volumes through the balance of the year, resulting in an approximately $40 million reduction in gross margin as compared to our prior outlook. While the recent pullback was more abrupt than our initial expectations, moderation in carrier spend following the recent historic levels of activity we've seen in the industry isn't unexpected and is consistent with past network generation investment cycles. Despite this reduction, we're still seeing healthy levels of activity on our sites, which we expect to continue, and our guide still assumes over $40 million in services gross margin contribution in the back half of the year which on an annualized basis, is still in excess of any year throughout the 4G cycle. It is also important to note that although our services business is non-run rate, more susceptible to in-period carrier activity and cyclical in nature, our comprehensive MLAs continue to provide us with a high degree of visibility and contractual protection against activity variability in our 2023 property revenue and organic tenant billings guide, as well as the growth we've assumed in our long-term U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth target. Finally, on the macro side, we have revised our FX and interest assumptions. Starting with FX our revised outlook includes the negative impact associated with the recent devaluation in the Nigerian Naira with impacts partially mitigated through the USD denomination of roughly half of our tenant revenues in the market. This is further offset by the strengthening of other currencies in our portfolio, resulting in minimal FX impacts versus our prior outlook. On the interest side, our guidance reflects a modest increase to interest expense based on the updated forward curve estimates of SOFR, partially offset by interest income.  With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $125 million as compared to our prior outlook. Outperformance was driven by approximately $65 million in core property revenue supported by increases to the U.S. and Canada segment, which includes the benefits of several non-recurring onetime items along with our U.S. data center and international segments. Complementing our core upside, we're also increasing our outlook by another $60 million, primarily associated with straight line and pass-through revenue. Moving to Slide 9, we are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth at a consolidated and international level. In the U.S. and Canada, we are maintaining our guidance of approximately 5% or over 6% excluding sprint churn, with an expectation for at least $220 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from greater than 2% to approximately 4%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. In Europe, we are raising our guidance to approximately 8%, up from 7% to 8% previously, supported by modest improvements in our escalator contributions, together with an expectation for colocation and amendment growth to be closer to the upper end of our initial 2% to 3% assumption as we continue to make operational progress in Germany on leasing up our rooftop assets. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from approximately 9% to greater than 11%, primarily due to a continuation of solid new business demand. Although we are pleased with the acceleration in organic tenant billings growth in APAC in Q2, we are maintaining our prior outlook of approximately 4% at this time.  Moving on to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $75 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue I just mentioned, facilitated through prudent cost controls resulting in an incremental $75 million in cash property gross margin, along with an additional $40 million, primarily due to straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $40 million associated with our U.S. services business.  Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $25 million at the midpoint, representing approximately $0.05 on a per share basis moving the midpoint to $9.70 per share. Updates to our expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $35 million, partially offset by approximately $10 million in other items, including the impacts of interest expense and also a slightly higher minority interest, which is the product of outperformance in our U.S. data center business.  Moving on to Slide 12, while our capital allocation plans remain consistent relative to our prior outlook, primarily consisting of $3 billion in common stock dividends, subject to Board approval and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, I'd like to spend a moment to review our approach to ensure adequate capacity for our CoreSite business as we support an elevated backlog and expectations for continued future demand. On the left side of the slide, you see our plans continue to assume approximately $360 million in discretionary spend allocated to our U.S. data center business in 2023. This level of spend supports a high watermark of cash backlog, driven by the record levels of leasing since closing our acquisition at the end of 2021.  Similarly, our retail and scale backlog, excluding hyperscale, is also at record levels, demonstrating the strength of the core business and diversification of new leasing which we expect to drive incremental ecosystem value and a continuation of the industry-leading returns CoreSite has produced historically. The differentiated nature of the CoreSite assets, representing a network, cloud and digital platform rich interconnection hub, which in conjunction with large-scale, purpose-built adjacent capacity uniquely positions CoreSite to support the high-performance workloads of today and in the future including expected incremental AI capacity needs.  Combined with the favorable supply and demand dynamics we're seeing across the data center industry, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive double-digit stabilized yields on our development investments, largely supported by the reinvestment of CoreSite's own cash flows with further support from American Tower and our partner, Stonepeak. In fact, our pre-leasing at the end of the quarter was approximately 36%, which further derisks our capital investments and illustrates the robust demand we're seeing across the space. While such demand drives the need for incremental investment, we are eager to support the business and realize the attractive rates of return CoreSite has historically proven, while remaining selective and disciplined in current and future development priorities and decisions. Moving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to execute on our financing initiatives in the quarter raising $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt, extending our average maturity to over six years while reducing our floating rate debt balance to below 15%. We also closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.3 times ahead of our own deleveraging path towards our targeted range of 3 to 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic in potentially further accessing the debt capital markets to appropriately manage our investment-grade balance sheet.  Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, our business continues to demonstrate resiliency and benefit from ongoing demand across our operations while effectively mitigating certain risks and variability through the strength of our customer agreements. Supported by a continuation and positive growth trends in Q2, we were able to increase the full year outlook midpoints across the majority of our key metrics, largely supported by core property outperformance across our tower and data center segments. We believe our global portfolio, strong balance sheet, best-in-class operating capabilities, disciplined approach to capital allocation, and keen focus to drive long-term efficiencies across our organization has American Tower well positioned to deliver strong, sustained growth in shareholder returns as we close 2023 and over the long term. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nEric Luebchow: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to touch on the U.S. domestic leasing environment. We heard from one of your peers that carrier activity had slowed substantially during Q2. It looks like you're seeing a little bit of that in your service revenues, but I wanted to talk more about your organic tenant billings growth. Obviously, you reiterated the guide this year, but as we look beyond 2023, I know you have I think, 75% locked in into your long-term guide, but could it sustain slowdown in carrier activity, put that 5% number potentially at risk beyond 2023, maybe you could just walk through some of the puts and takes there?\nRod Smith: Hey, Eric, good morning. And thanks for the question and thanks for joining the call. So as the other tower companies are experiencing the slowdown with the carrier spend, we're seeing that as well. You rightly point out, you see it mostly in the services revenue. So for us, you noticed we took our guide down from over $200 million down to about $175 million. In that process, we also were able to increase our margins and kind of mitigate some of that softness. The thing that I would point out there as it relates to services is the level of activity we see continuing into the back half of the year, even through the slowdown, it's still equal to or better than the high watermark of level of activity we experienced throughout the 4G cycle. So we still view the services business and activity levels as pretty healthy. And this is not inconsistent with what we've seen in other technology upgrades with the carriers to have an initial burst of spending they get their network upgraded on the new technology. Then you see a pullback in CAPEX and that sustained level of new CAPEX under the cycle is typically higher than the last cycle. And that's what we're seeing, that's what we expect. In terms of the longer-term guidance is you think the way that our comprehensive agreements are set up, we really are in very good shape we think, from now out to 2027. So I'll just remind you in terms of what our long-term guide was. We are seeing an average of about 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. from now until 2027. And the slowdown does not change our view there because the vast majority of that is fully contracted. That includes the incremental impact of sprint churn. Without that, we'd be at about 6%. And again, we don't see that changing because this pullback or slowdown as described from carriers because of the way that our holistic or comprehensive agreements were. So that's kind of -- that's the strong nature of those comprehensive agreements that we have. It really does protect us from these fluctuations in spend from quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. And within that guide, we do have 4% to 5% of activity base, new business kind of coming through. So I think from that perspective, we're in pretty good shape.\nEric Luebchow: Great, thanks Rod. And just one follow-up. I wanted to touch on the data center business. Maybe you could give a little more color on the strength you've seen there. Is it coming from more of your traditional retail colocation requirements or are you starting to see increased demand for larger footprint deals perhaps tied to some of the AI demand we've heard about in the market with the cloud service providers, and I guess, given the demand backdrop, do you think that maybe CAPEX needs in that business might need to go up in future years or do you feel kind of comfortable with where you're at in terms of capital intensity with CoreSite?\nTom Bartlett: Eric, maybe I'll start this one, and then Rod can finish on. I think the mix of customers has actually been pretty consistent across the cloud and enterprise and the network. I think as Rod mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see a kind of record levels of cash backlog that's contracted revenue that's going to hit a balance of this year and into 2024 and a little bit into 2025. We see a pipeline that's up roughly 70%. We see pricing and it's up 15% on a year-over-year basis. Even the renewal rate, the MLR [ph] renewal rates is up at the 7% level. So there is a significant demand for these assets. We have a significant amount under development and a significant amount in the pipeline. So we're really outpacing the way we even underwrote the transaction to begin with. So really pleased with what we're seeing across the data center platform.\nRod Smith: Yes, Eric, maybe I would add just a couple of other comments to Tom's answer there. The overall growth that we're seeing in CoreSite is really healthy. We saw 10% overall revenue growth in Q1. We're seeing high single-digit growth in Q2. So you put that together for the first half and the revenue was up high single digits, which is really robust. We continue to see healthy escalators in that business. The cash mark-to-market is still up in our range, at the high end of our range, even beyond the 3% high end of the range. The churn is well controlled and within our range of 6% to 8%. Interconnection growth, we've always targeted 6% to 8%. We're seeing a higher level of growth than that today. So that's that ecosystem that we have kind of at work producing what we hope to produce. And then hitting the CAPEX part of your question, we've got $360 million this year in CAPEX, we had about $300 million last year. And we do think that's a good run rate. It will fluctuate from time to time, but the purpose for our CAPEX program, of course, is really to make sure that we have the adequate capacity available to satisfy the new business and the demand in the backlog. So you can see from the chart, we have an average backlog of about $53 million, which will be deployed over the next 18 to 24 months or so. So we are ensuring that we have that capacity available. So that $360 million really is going into the 28 locations we have, the campuses either adding buildings into those campuses or adding conditioned space within existing buildings to make sure that we're keeping pace with the demand that we see. And the demand is robust. So certainly, there's opportunities to deploy even a little bit more capital. We'll continue to evaluate the returns and the growth rates and those sorts of things. But all in, we're exceptionally pleased with the way the data center business is performing. And we do think staying in that between 300 to 360 in and around that area is the right place in terms of ensuring we have the capacity available to meet the demand in our current facilities.\nEric Luebchow: Great, thank you for the questions. \nOperator: Next, we move to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good morning. Rod, I wanted to come back to the balance sheet if we could. Good updates on the floating rate debt and the leverage. You said in there, you want to continue to delever and I guess this also brings in Tom. You haven't done a lot of deals since the CoreSite deal. And I know you've been in this kind of focus on the balance sheet kind of period. So perhaps you just talk about what does -- where you want to get to on the leverage side of things and are you starting to think about being more opportunistic on the M&A side and maybe any commentary on the bid offer spreads, I know you talked about the India deal a little bit, but where do you see the opportunity to find things at a reasonable value, given the move in rates, etcetera? Thank you. \nRod Smith: Yes. Good morning Simon, thanks for joining the call. Thanks for the question. So delevering is a priority for us. We've talked about that for quite a while. It comes in a couple of forms, outright in reducing overall debt, we're focused on that as well. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. You saw that we ended Q2 at just over that at about 5.3 times. So a little outside that window. We want to get down below 5 times, and that's what we're really focused on going forward.  With that said, when we look at our capital program, our overall priorities haven't changed. We still prioritize the dividend and dividend growth so that's key. We see very good day one NOI yields and returns in the new build program. So this year, we're deploying about 1.7 billion in capital. We think that's a very good use of capital and resources for our shareholders. And then beyond that, when you look at M&A, as Tom has talked about in the past, in our pipeline today, we just don't see anything compelling. That's a combination of terms and conditions and markets where they're available in different criteria. So we look globally, we look at the pipeline, we continue to have a pipeline that we review. But again, nothing is compelling. So with that said, and in the specific environment where the rate -- the go-forward interest rate is still uncertain, we think it's very prudent to prioritize delevering and debt reduction. We think it's very prudent to reduce the amount of floating rate debt so we lock in our interest rates on a larger portion of our debt. So going forward, our target range is about 20% for floating rate debt. We've got that down to around 15%. And I think in Q3, you'll see us continue to be opportunistic depending on where the rates are in the U.S. and where the 10-year is in the U.S. and the benchmark over in Europe. You could see us back in the capital markets to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt even below the 15%. And you'll see us going forward this year and well into next prioritizing delevering and trying to get down below 5 times.\nTom Bartlett: Yes, Simon, I think I'll just underscore. I think it comes back to what Rod's saying is that there's nothing strategic out there. There's nothing compelling. We find it much more advantageous to invest in our own business that is through deleveraging, that is through investing through our capital. That's through buying back shares, I mean, given where we're trading. So we find it much more valuable to allocate our capital that way at this point in time than anything we see out in the market.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just two on international. I guess, first on the churn expectations. I think, Rod, you had alluded to maybe some reduced expectations for churn at least this year in LatAm, just wondering if you can give us any updates in terms of the outlook, both for LatAm and Africa and whether the ultimate sort of churn expectations have been reduced or is this more of a deferral than anything else? And then secondarily, just on India, if you could maybe give us any additional color in terms of updates on discussions. You mentioned, I think, second half in terms of when you'd like to have the process completed, so any additional color would be great there? Thanks. \nRod Smith: Hey Matt, good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding the debt, the simple answer here is the -- some of the increases in our organic tenant billings for the balance of the year is really a delay in churn, not an expectation that churn is going to be materially lower over the long term. So, it's primarily in Latin America driven by the oi churn, which is delayed. So we do anticipate that to pick up later in the year in Q3 and Q4. And that oi churn is about 2% of our overall -- within our organic tenant billings growth, it's 200 basis points in that revised kind of view of that approximately 4%. So it really is a timing issue there. And then in Africa, it's pretty consistent. We're seeing some delays, but nothing too material, and it's not a change in terms of our overall long-term view in Africa. We're still looking at some churn in AirtelTigo in Ghana and Cell C is churning off some sites down in South Africa. So churn ends up being approximately 6% in the African market. And Latin America, it's about 6.5% kind of in total for the year. The other thing I would highlight is in Africa, we are seeing elevated levels of new business and activity. So we've been really pleased with that. So that's the churn piece. I guess jumping over to India, I'll just make a couple of comments on our process there. So as you know and as we've talked about in the past, we're fully engaged in a process in India. It started with a full evaluation of the market, particularly the future impacts of that market under different scenarios. And we're also evaluating potential uses of capital that we may take out of that market as a result of this process. We are -- we continue to focus and we're very engaged with a few remaining select investors. We're highly focused on selling a majority stake in that business anywhere, and I'll be kind of broad the process is continuing here, but anywhere from 50% to 100% stake sale. I don't want to talk about any more details than that. Of course, valuation is always important. Terms and conditions are always important. They are primary key considerations for us as we work through it. And I would say at the moment, we're happy with the progress that we've made to date. We've been working on it for quite some time. We are in the late stages of the process. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect to complete a transaction sometime during the second half of this year. That's kind of what we're looking for. And our goal is to drive the best outcome for our shareholders through this process. We're going to remain very thoughtful, very disciplined, and very patient as we get through the final stages here. And we hope to update you all at some point soon in terms of the process and next steps here. But again, we're in late stages of the process.\nMatthew Niknam: Excellent, thank you. \nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to revisit some of the comments that you're providing around the carrier activity in the U.S. and specifically, is there a way to frame what changed relative to the carrier activity expectations that American Tower may have had earlier in the year for the full year 2023 and then given that customers under these comprehensive MLAs can execute a certain amount of capacity and if activity is less, does that mean they're not taking full advantage of the capacity they're paying for and then create some form of greater backlog of deployments that need to come through the system in the future?\nTom Bartlett: Hey Michael, maybe I'll start and then Rod can kind of kick in. And the types of questions you're asking for, I think, are probably more appropriate for them. We've seen T-Mobile come out and say they're rolling out more carriers. We've seen Verizon talk about their deployment and looking for more mid-band and how that's going to drive kind of the second wave. But I think if you kind of step back, the pullback that we're seeing in spending today is absolutely reflective of the cadence of network investment cycles that we've seen historically. I mean you and I have both been around long enough to see most of them and meet all of them and how that cadence has progressed. And the 5G cycle is no different, at least from my perspective, than what we saw with prior cycles.  I mean it -- when we looked at our long-term growth expectations for U.S. and Canada in 2021, we had and had anticipated having those comprehensive MLAs in place. And so it's obviously kind of straight line what we are looking at in terms of our overall growth and protects from -- as we've talked about this kind of signed wave, if you will, of development. But the cycles typically progress as there's a coverage cycle. It's what we've seen in past cycles, including 3G and 4G. It's an initial multiyear period of elevated coverage CAPEX, and it's tied to new G spectrum aimed at upgrading the existing infrastructure. It's largely cost based. I mean the carriers are dropping in new technology to bring down their overall cost per bit as well as then positioning themselves to be able to offer their customers, their consumers and enterprise customers more technology and more capability. It's then followed by some grooming that will go on. And perhaps that's kind of the stage that we're starting to see ourselves in at this point in time.  And then later in the cycle, it will fill back into a capacity stage where we'll start to see more densification going on. And so when we think of kind of the services and the cadence, if you will, every time it is difficult to predict because the cycles from each of the customers are so different. As Rod said, the $175 million or so that we're looking to service, it is kind of the third -- largest on record. Last two years, we're up, I think, north of the $200 million range. But there still is a sizable year for our services business. So -- and our customers themselves are spending still record level versus where they were spending in 4G. So I know there's a lot of this anticipation of what's going on in 5G, why is this pull back and spend in 5G. I think we need to take a look at kind of a broader period of time here and saying, okay, our customers have deployed 5G to a large extent, they're continuing to deploy. We still do see obviously, services activity from all of them and we would expect to move through over the decade further levels of investment as they continue to drive more value for enterprises as well as then more value for consumers.  So I'm hopeful that our investor base doesn't get spooked by the fact that this is a pullback. It's very consistent. The cadence is really spot on with what we've seen with other technologies. And we're going to -- we continue, as well as any of our customers do, heavily investments in the 5G networks over time.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we go to Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nRichard Prentiss: Thanks, good morning everybody. A couple of questions to follow up on some of the ones we had. Thanks for the updates on India, but a few extra ones. Can you remind us again how much you spent in India, where is that on your books right now as we look to maybe a transaction getting wrapped up here, hopefully?\nRod Smith: Yes, Rick, we've invested around $5 billion into the market. What we have on our books today is in the range of about $2.5 billion.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And earlier, I appreciate the color that India's Vodafone Idea looks like they're getting current and 100% going forward. At what point you thought you might take a stake on that receivable, is that kind of on pause as you go through wrapping up the strategic review, and did I hear you say you maybe have slowed down some of the builds in India, is that also related to kind of the process?\nRod Smith: I guess on the first piece, when you say a stake in the receivables, you might be talking about the idea of converting some of the receivables with VIL into a different type of financial instrument. We have done that, Rick. So we've got about $200 million of prior receivables that we've converted into more of a financial note or a note receivable. So that is in place, and I think it will certainly work to our advantage over time. We are seeing a slowdown in terms of the new builds in India. And it is partly driven by our view, a higher cost of capital kind of reviewing pricing and our overall appetite to invest in the market. It doesn't mean that those new builds might not accelerate again if the opportunities come through with some higher pricing and higher returns. But the -- we're focused on driving the highest returns on the opportunities that we have to build. But we are seeing kind of a reduction there in India. And it's not because the overall demand is down. It's really we're being very disciplined and patient. And we're also continuing to build towers in Europe and Africa and a handful in Latin America. So in this environment, we're just being very selective and putting our capital towards the sites that give us the highest growth, the highest risk-adjusted rates of return going forward, and we balance that with our desire to delever and prioritize some capital towards delevering this year and into next.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And then you also mentioned delevering is a priority, makes sense. But that stock buyback might make sense in the future, particularly compared to M&A out there. What would be the timing to think about putting a plan in place and how low does leverage have to get maybe?\nRod Smith: Yes. I would say, I mean, we want to be opportunistic there. But we're also -- we want to get down below 5 times. There's a combination of a couple of things, Rick. I think you want to watch where our leverage is getting down below 5 times. I've said in the past and we continue to be ahead of the delevering schedule with the rating agency. So from that perspective, where we sit today, we're very comfortable. We want to accelerate that delevering and get down below 5 times well ahead of the rating agency agreed plan because of the uncertainty around interest rates and the high cost of carrying debt these days as you've all experienced. So you want to watch kind of where our leverage goes and the closer we get to 5 times, the lower that overall leverage gets. And certainly, when it gets down below 5 times, we might hit a little bit more flexibility kind of in our capital allocation.  The other thing that we are watching is the rate environment and where that goes, and when there will be a little less uncertainty around rates. And when they peak and begin to come down, we're not making any bets on when that will happen, but that will be something we continue to watch. And depending on how that unfolds, we may be able to prioritize buybacks sooner rather than later or maybe not if rates continue to stay high and this continued uncertainty. So we'll be watching both the rate environment here in the U.S. And as you know, we do a lot of borrowing in Euro denominated debt as well, and we'll be looking at our overall leverage. Hopefully, that helps. And of course, the share price is part of that as well.\nRichard Prentiss: Yup, it all makes sense, all the calculus that you look at. Great, thanks. Everyone stay well. \nOperator: Next, we go to Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Atkin: Thanks very much. On the CoreSite strength, Tom, you talked about positive renewal spreads and pricing. I wondered, is that happening as a result of like higher price list for cabinets and for cross connects, is that kind of a deliberate action you're taking on both new business and applying it to the base or if you can kind of tell us a little bit about the source of that strength? And then I wanted to ask about -- I think just real quick on DISH with their -- Dave Mayo retiring and then some of the uncertainty around that, how should we think broadly about U.S. leasing trends beyond this year just in a qualitative sense? Thanks.\nTom Bartlett: I think relative to DISH, Dave has been a great partner of ours going forward as well as the entire business. So I'm sure while he will be missed I've got a great team in place there, Jonathan. So I don't think they're going to miss a beat. As I said, Dave is a great guy, really a great engineer, very, very technical and has been instrumental to driving the business. But they're a big business and like with ours. I mean, if we lost one person and that changed the direction of the business, that would be a sad thing. So they're a large institution, and I think they're well positioned and a good partner of ours. So I don't see any change there at all. With regard -- your first question, Jonathan, was?\nJonathan Atkin: Yes, of course, a little bit more color around the CoreSite, the strength you are seeing? \nTom Bartlett: Right, right. A lot of it is a function of our own pricing increase that we put in place. I mean looking at the market, looking at the demand, they were initiated by ourselves. The volumes are robust, as I said, the pricing is up 15% above first half of 2022. The funnel was healthy. As a matter of fact, on the funnel on the $54 million, I think 80% of it is actually retail and scale. So largely enterprise driven as opposed to even having a major piece driven by the scale. And on the 7%, historically, we've been in that 2% to 4% rate. So very pleased with the fact of those renewal rates being up significantly above where we've been historically.\nJonathan Atkin: I think anything around innovation initiatives around EDGE data centers, things of that nature?\nTom Bartlett: Yes. We have a number of projects going on within the business, candidly, Jonathan. No news to report. Working on several different pilots with potential customers. As I mentioned in the past, we have a number of sites that are -- have a significant ability to add capacity of power at each one of them. So still very early days, early innings of that. Hopeful that AI inferencing in particular, will drive even more of that need out at the customer prem. So we continue to explore, continue to work through a number of different pilots and projects, but nothing new to report at this point.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. \nOperator: Next, we go to Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. \nGregory Williams: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just the first one would be on the cadence of your U.S. new leasing going forward. So you hit about 119 in new leasing in the first half of the year, and you're guiding 220 for the full year, that implies a notable step down to like $50 million mark per quarter in the next two quarters. But you did give yourself leg room by saying at least $220 million here in full guidance. So I'm just trying to understand how much of this is conservatism versus taking our estimates down to the low 50s? And just second question, in that new leasing are you seeing a lot of DoD spectrum or dual-band radio spectrum being deployed and if not, could we then see another leg of growth as these dual-band radios and DoD get scaled and ready to deploy?\nRod Smith: Hey Greg, thanks for the question. Regarding the cadence here, I think you do want to plan for that lower 50 certainly by the time you get out to Q4. We'll see a slight deceleration from Q3 to Q4. So maybe you're up in the mid-50s and the low 50s by the time you get to Q4, but that's what we do expect and see in terms of the new business in the U.S. going forward. And it's very in line with kind of that 220, 220 plus sort of range. So we're certainly very happy with that, and it drives about a 5% new business growth contribution to that overall organic tenant balance growth.  And then in terms of the DoD and the spectrum, we're not seeing a lot of that. I'm not sure, Greg, if I would go out and say that, that upside is certainly not in the short term, if it would, it would probably be clearly small here this year. We wouldn't expect to see much of an impact. And to the extent that it is deployed later some of that may be within our holistic agreements as well with certain carriers.\nGregory Williams: Got it, thank you. \nRod Smith: You are welcome. \nOperator: And our next question is from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead. \nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. A couple of follow-ups. First, how do you think about your current scale in the data center business against the growing demand that you're experiencing? And on the services side, you did mention that there was an abrupt slowdown in carrier activity. Was that across the board or specific to one or two clients and do you provide the split for installation versus maybe managed services and one of your peers is getting out of the installation business, how do you think about that? Thank you. \nRod Smith: Hey Batya, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. I think when you think about data centers, we're happy with the scale that we have. We've got great facilities, 28 facilities across really eight key markets. Their eco -- the ecosystem there is very rich with cloud on-ramps and network companies and enterprise customers. And it really gives us kind of the backdrop and the footprint that we need. And we're not seeing any headwinds because of a lack of scale. So all the great financial results that we're seeing, we're able to do it, because of the quality of the ecosystem and the way that these facilities are distributed throughout the U.S. So from that perspective, we feel really good with our data center investment to date. Now certainly, adding a location here or there, you've seen us do that a little bit even before we bought CoreSite. That certainly could be in the cards going forward. But we really do like the assets we have. We're not overly focused on trying to ramp up the scale as we've talked about in the past. When it comes to services, I would say we are seeing a slowdown -- it's -- I don't know if abrupt is the right word to use there, but we did see kind of a slowdown. I wouldn't say that it's across the board. I don't want to get into specific carrier by carrier, of course. But some carriers continue to plug right along and others have slowed down a little bit. Again, it's not unexpected from our view. When it comes to the final part of your question, in terms of the construction services, that's always been a pretty small part of our business. We've been maybe a little different than some of our competitors from that perspective. It is a small piece and it continues to be a small piece of our business. Most of what we do is in the permitting zoning engineering kind of those preconstruction activities. We do some construction services and deployment but not a lot.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you. \nRod Smith: You are welcome.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up on the grooming comment that you made earlier. Does that typically last for just a few quarters or is that something longer? And then I have one more.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. I mean, it depends -- it will be depending on the carrier, on the customer themselves. Typically, as we've said in the past, I mean, things happen in the form of sign ways. We see heavy build, then we'll see a lighter build as it gets filled. I mean the carriers aren't going to be spending the money ahead of time until they see the network demand. And so there will be certain locations, certain geographies, urban parts of the market, mortgage and is more of the suburban, where you can see shorter cycles on the grooming side. So it really depends on the customer. And it's -- you can't really come up with a kind of an average, if you will, overall.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then on the expense side, are you seeing any pressure in the domestic business on ground lease renegotiations on renewals, given where CPI or inflation is?\nRod Smith: No, Richard, I would say we're really not. I mean we have long-term leases on the vast majority of these sites. We either own or have 20-year leases on more than 70% of our sites approaching 75%. So we're in good shape from that perspective. And we do a lot of work well ahead of expirations of the ground leases to renew these things and kind of move the exploration data out or buy the land through our capital program. So we don't see and we're really not exposed to any short-term significant spikes in land rent because of an inflationary environment. On average, our land goes up in line with our revenue in that 3%, 3% to 4% range.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. \nRod Smith: You are welcome. \nOperator: I'll now turn the conference back to the leadership team for closing comments.\nAdam Smith: Thanks, everyone for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to myself or the Investor Relations team with any further questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong second quarter reflecting a continuation of resilient demand for our diversified global portfolio, and solid operational execution across our organization. Before I walk through the details of our Q2 results, and revised full year outlook, I'll start with highlighting a few items from the quarter. First, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, raising approximately $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt through a combination of Euro and U.S. dollar denominated senior notes at a weighted average cost of 4.9%. As a result, we decreased our exposure to floating rate debt to approximately $6 billion or less than 15% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the second quarter.  Next, the momentum experienced across our global business in Q1 continued into the second quarter with outperformance across new business, escalations and churn, resulting in another quarter of over 6% organic tenant billings growth, allowing us to raise our full year expectations across our Latin America, Europe, and Africa segments. We also had another strong quarter at CoreSite where elevated leasing volumes since our acquisition continued into Q2, and were further supported by solid pricing trends, high renewal rates, and interconnection growth of approximately 10%, which together with our tower business drove property revenue growth of over 4% in the quarter. Complementing top line growth, and as I highlighted last quarter, we are maintaining a strong focus on cost management. Once again in Q2, despite an elevated inflationary environment, we kept cash SG&A roughly flat year-over-year, helping to support an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points to 63.1% or over 100 basis points when normalizing for VIL reserves. Finally, we continue to engage in active discussions with a focused group of investors around the potential sale of a majority equity interest in our India business as we assess strategic options in the market, and exercise we anticipate completing in the second half of the year. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient with the goal of achieving the best outcome for American Tower and its shareholders. With that, please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, Q2 consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth was over 4% or over 6% on an FX neutral basis. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 5%, international growth of nearly 3%, or over 7%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and over 7% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter we recognized approximately $35 million in revenue reserves associated with VIL short payments, as collection patterns in Q2 were relatively consistent with that of Q1. Moving to the right side of the slide, we achieved another strong quarter of organic tenant billings growth, which stood at 6.2% on a consolidated basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and approximately 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of elevated colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million. Our international segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily due to a combination of higher than anticipated colocation and amendment growth and continued churn delays, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9% up from 7.5% in Q1. At a segment level, Africa, Europe, and APAC produce growth of 12.9%, 8.3%, and 5.6% respectively, each in acceleration off of Q1, with Africa representing a record for the region, APAC delivering its highest quarter since Q3 of 2017, and Europe demonstrating growth of over 575 basis points above its pre-Telsius [ph] average. In Latin America, we did see a modest deceleration of 5.4% as expected. Consistent with the last quarter, we continued to realize benefits associated with CPI linked escalators across the vast majority of our international markets while a continued delay in anticipated consolidation driven churn in Latin America has kept reported churn favorable to our initial expectations through the first half of the year.  Finally, strong leasing trends across our international business has driven an acceleration in colocation and amendment growth contributions across nearly all of our segments, resulting in an approximately 40 basis point improvement sequentially at a consolidated international level. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of more than 565 sites with virtually all of the step down relative to Q1 associated with India volumes, as we continue to prioritize capital deployments across our footprint to projects that demonstrate the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return.  Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 5% to over $1.7 billion or approximately 6% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 63.1% driven by elevated organic growth, combined with prudent cost controls throughout the business, which allowed for a conversion of over 85% of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth, again, on a normalized VIL basis. Cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 6.8%, and over 20 basis point improvement compared to prior year. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share decreased by less than 1% and approximately 2%, respectively. This decline includes financing cost headwinds of approximately 7% and 9% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, driven by the rise in interest rates over the past year.  Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, as mentioned earlier, we had a solid second quarter, and the core performance of the business continues to remain strong supporting an increase to our expectations for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share. Next, consistent with our prior outlook, we have maintained our VIL revenue reserve assumption of $75 million for the year. As I noted, we saw similar collection trends in the second quarter as compared to Q1 bringing our year-to-date reserves associated with VIL to approximately $70 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, VIL made a full payment for July's billings and has committed to paying at least 100% of billings moving forward. In this case, we could potentially see some upside to our outlook assumption. However, we believe it is prudent to leave the full year assumption unchanged at this time.  Additionally, we have assumed lower U.S. services volumes through the balance of the year, resulting in an approximately $40 million reduction in gross margin as compared to our prior outlook. While the recent pullback was more abrupt than our initial expectations, moderation in carrier spend following the recent historic levels of activity we've seen in the industry isn't unexpected and is consistent with past network generation investment cycles. Despite this reduction, we're still seeing healthy levels of activity on our sites, which we expect to continue, and our guide still assumes over $40 million in services gross margin contribution in the back half of the year which on an annualized basis, is still in excess of any year throughout the 4G cycle. It is also important to note that although our services business is non-run rate, more susceptible to in-period carrier activity and cyclical in nature, our comprehensive MLAs continue to provide us with a high degree of visibility and contractual protection against activity variability in our 2023 property revenue and organic tenant billings guide, as well as the growth we've assumed in our long-term U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth target. Finally, on the macro side, we have revised our FX and interest assumptions. Starting with FX our revised outlook includes the negative impact associated with the recent devaluation in the Nigerian Naira with impacts partially mitigated through the USD denomination of roughly half of our tenant revenues in the market. This is further offset by the strengthening of other currencies in our portfolio, resulting in minimal FX impacts versus our prior outlook. On the interest side, our guidance reflects a modest increase to interest expense based on the updated forward curve estimates of SOFR, partially offset by interest income.  With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $125 million as compared to our prior outlook. Outperformance was driven by approximately $65 million in core property revenue supported by increases to the U.S. and Canada segment, which includes the benefits of several non-recurring onetime items along with our U.S. data center and international segments. Complementing our core upside, we're also increasing our outlook by another $60 million, primarily associated with straight line and pass-through revenue. Moving to Slide 9, we are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth at a consolidated and international level. In the U.S. and Canada, we are maintaining our guidance of approximately 5% or over 6% excluding sprint churn, with an expectation for at least $220 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from greater than 2% to approximately 4%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. In Europe, we are raising our guidance to approximately 8%, up from 7% to 8% previously, supported by modest improvements in our escalator contributions, together with an expectation for colocation and amendment growth to be closer to the upper end of our initial 2% to 3% assumption as we continue to make operational progress in Germany on leasing up our rooftop assets. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from approximately 9% to greater than 11%, primarily due to a continuation of solid new business demand. Although we are pleased with the acceleration in organic tenant billings growth in APAC in Q2, we are maintaining our prior outlook of approximately 4% at this time.  Moving on to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $75 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue I just mentioned, facilitated through prudent cost controls resulting in an incremental $75 million in cash property gross margin, along with an additional $40 million, primarily due to straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $40 million associated with our U.S. services business.  Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $25 million at the midpoint, representing approximately $0.05 on a per share basis moving the midpoint to $9.70 per share. Updates to our expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $35 million, partially offset by approximately $10 million in other items, including the impacts of interest expense and also a slightly higher minority interest, which is the product of outperformance in our U.S. data center business.  Moving on to Slide 12, while our capital allocation plans remain consistent relative to our prior outlook, primarily consisting of $3 billion in common stock dividends, subject to Board approval and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, I'd like to spend a moment to review our approach to ensure adequate capacity for our CoreSite business as we support an elevated backlog and expectations for continued future demand. On the left side of the slide, you see our plans continue to assume approximately $360 million in discretionary spend allocated to our U.S. data center business in 2023. This level of spend supports a high watermark of cash backlog, driven by the record levels of leasing since closing our acquisition at the end of 2021.  Similarly, our retail and scale backlog, excluding hyperscale, is also at record levels, demonstrating the strength of the core business and diversification of new leasing which we expect to drive incremental ecosystem value and a continuation of the industry-leading returns CoreSite has produced historically. The differentiated nature of the CoreSite assets, representing a network, cloud and digital platform rich interconnection hub, which in conjunction with large-scale, purpose-built adjacent capacity uniquely positions CoreSite to support the high-performance workloads of today and in the future including expected incremental AI capacity needs.  Combined with the favorable supply and demand dynamics we're seeing across the data center industry, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive double-digit stabilized yields on our development investments, largely supported by the reinvestment of CoreSite's own cash flows with further support from American Tower and our partner, Stonepeak. In fact, our pre-leasing at the end of the quarter was approximately 36%, which further derisks our capital investments and illustrates the robust demand we're seeing across the space. While such demand drives the need for incremental investment, we are eager to support the business and realize the attractive rates of return CoreSite has historically proven, while remaining selective and disciplined in current and future development priorities and decisions. Moving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to execute on our financing initiatives in the quarter raising $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt, extending our average maturity to over six years while reducing our floating rate debt balance to below 15%. We also closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.3 times ahead of our own deleveraging path towards our targeted range of 3 to 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic in potentially further accessing the debt capital markets to appropriately manage our investment-grade balance sheet.  Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, our business continues to demonstrate resiliency and benefit from ongoing demand across our operations while effectively mitigating certain risks and variability through the strength of our customer agreements. Supported by a continuation and positive growth trends in Q2, we were able to increase the full year outlook midpoints across the majority of our key metrics, largely supported by core property outperformance across our tower and data center segments. We believe our global portfolio, strong balance sheet, best-in-class operating capabilities, disciplined approach to capital allocation, and keen focus to drive long-term efficiencies across our organization has American Tower well positioned to deliver strong, sustained growth in shareholder returns as we close 2023 and over the long term. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions. Hey, Eric, good morning. And thanks for the question and thanks for joining the call. So as the other tower companies are experiencing the slowdown with the carrier spend, we're seeing that as well. You rightly point out, you see it mostly in the services revenue. So for us, you noticed we took our guide down from over $200 million down to about $175 million. In that process, we also were able to increase our margins and kind of mitigate some of that softness. The thing that I would point out there as it relates to services is the level of activity we see continuing into the back half of the year, even through the slowdown, it's still equal to or better than the high watermark of level of activity we experienced throughout the 4G cycle. So we still view the services business and activity levels as pretty healthy. And this is not inconsistent with what we've seen in other technology upgrades with the carriers to have an initial burst of spending they get their network upgraded on the new technology. Then you see a pullback in CAPEX and that sustained level of new CAPEX under the cycle is typically higher than the last cycle. And that's what we're seeing, that's what we expect. In terms of the longer-term guidance is you think the way that our comprehensive agreements are set up, we really are in very good shape we think, from now out to 2027. So I'll just remind you in terms of what our long-term guide was. We are seeing an average of about 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. from now until 2027. And the slowdown does not change our view there because the vast majority of that is fully contracted. That includes the incremental impact of sprint churn. Without that, we'd be at about 6%. And again, we don't see that changing because this pullback or slowdown as described from carriers because of the way that our holistic or comprehensive agreements were. So that's kind of -- that's the strong nature of those comprehensive agreements that we have. It really does protect us from these fluctuations in spend from quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. And within that guide, we do have 4% to 5% of activity base, new business kind of coming through. So I think from that perspective, we're in pretty good shape. Yes, Eric, maybe I would add just a couple of other comments to Tom's answer there. The overall growth that we're seeing in CoreSite is really healthy. We saw 10% overall revenue growth in Q1. We're seeing high single-digit growth in Q2. So you put that together for the first half and the revenue was up high single digits, which is really robust. We continue to see healthy escalators in that business. The cash mark-to-market is still up in our range, at the high end of our range, even beyond the 3% high end of the range. The churn is well controlled and within our range of 6% to 8%. Interconnection growth, we've always targeted 6% to 8%. We're seeing a higher level of growth than that today. So that's that ecosystem that we have kind of at work producing what we hope to produce. And then hitting the CAPEX part of your question, we've got $360 million this year in CAPEX, we had about $300 million last year. And we do think that's a good run rate. It will fluctuate from time to time, but the purpose for our CAPEX program, of course, is really to make sure that we have the adequate capacity available to satisfy the new business and the demand in the backlog. So you can see from the chart, we have an average backlog of about $53 million, which will be deployed over the next 18 to 24 months or so. So we are ensuring that we have that capacity available. So that $360 million really is going into the 28 locations we have, the campuses either adding buildings into those campuses or adding conditioned space within existing buildings to make sure that we're keeping pace with the demand that we see. And the demand is robust. So certainly, there's opportunities to deploy even a little bit more capital. We'll continue to evaluate the returns and the growth rates and those sorts of things. But all in, we're exceptionally pleased with the way the data center business is performing. And we do think staying in that between 300 to 360 in and around that area is the right place in terms of ensuring we have the capacity available to meet the demand in our current facilities. Yes. Good morning Simon, thanks for joining the call. Thanks for the question. So delevering is a priority for us. We've talked about that for quite a while. It comes in a couple of forms, outright in reducing overall debt, we're focused on that as well. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. You saw that we ended Q2 at just over that at about 5.3 times. So a little outside that window. We want to get down below 5 times, and that's what we're really focused on going forward.  With that said, when we look at our capital program, our overall priorities haven't changed. We still prioritize the dividend and dividend growth so that's key. We see very good day one NOI yields and returns in the new build program. So this year, we're deploying about 1.7 billion in capital. We think that's a very good use of capital and resources for our shareholders. And then beyond that, when you look at M&A, as Tom has talked about in the past, in our pipeline today, we just don't see anything compelling. That's a combination of terms and conditions and markets where they're available in different criteria. So we look globally, we look at the pipeline, we continue to have a pipeline that we review. But again, nothing is compelling. So with that said, and in the specific environment where the rate -- the go-forward interest rate is still uncertain, we think it's very prudent to prioritize delevering and debt reduction. We think it's very prudent to reduce the amount of floating rate debt so we lock in our interest rates on a larger portion of our debt. So going forward, our target range is about 20% for floating rate debt. We've got that down to around 15%. And I think in Q3, you'll see us continue to be opportunistic depending on where the rates are in the U.S. and where the 10-year is in the U.S. and the benchmark over in Europe. You could see us back in the capital markets to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt even below the 15%. And you'll see us going forward this year and well into next prioritizing delevering and trying to get down below 5 times. Hey Matt, good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding the debt, the simple answer here is the -- some of the increases in our organic tenant billings for the balance of the year is really a delay in churn, not an expectation that churn is going to be materially lower over the long term. So, it's primarily in Latin America driven by the oi churn, which is delayed. So we do anticipate that to pick up later in the year in Q3 and Q4. And that oi churn is about 2% of our overall -- within our organic tenant billings growth, it's 200 basis points in that revised kind of view of that approximately 4%. So it really is a timing issue there. And then in Africa, it's pretty consistent. We're seeing some delays, but nothing too material, and it's not a change in terms of our overall long-term view in Africa. We're still looking at some churn in AirtelTigo in Ghana and Cell C is churning off some sites down in South Africa. So churn ends up being approximately 6% in the African market. And Latin America, it's about 6.5% kind of in total for the year. The other thing I would highlight is in Africa, we are seeing elevated levels of new business and activity. So we've been really pleased with that. So that's the churn piece. I guess jumping over to India, I'll just make a couple of comments on our process there. So as you know and as we've talked about in the past, we're fully engaged in a process in India. It started with a full evaluation of the market, particularly the future impacts of that market under different scenarios. And we're also evaluating potential uses of capital that we may take out of that market as a result of this process. We are -- we continue to focus and we're very engaged with a few remaining select investors. We're highly focused on selling a majority stake in that business anywhere, and I'll be kind of broad the process is continuing here, but anywhere from 50% to 100% stake sale. I don't want to talk about any more details than that. Of course, valuation is always important. Terms and conditions are always important. They are primary key considerations for us as we work through it. And I would say at the moment, we're happy with the progress that we've made to date. We've been working on it for quite some time. We are in the late stages of the process. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect to complete a transaction sometime during the second half of this year. That's kind of what we're looking for. And our goal is to drive the best outcome for our shareholders through this process. We're going to remain very thoughtful, very disciplined, and very patient as we get through the final stages here. And we hope to update you all at some point soon in terms of the process and next steps here. But again, we're in late stages of the process. Yes, Rick, we've invested around $5 billion into the market. What we have on our books today is in the range of about $2.5 billion. I guess on the first piece, when you say a stake in the receivables, you might be talking about the idea of converting some of the receivables with VIL into a different type of financial instrument. We have done that, Rick. So we've got about $200 million of prior receivables that we've converted into more of a financial note or a note receivable. So that is in place, and I think it will certainly work to our advantage over time. We are seeing a slowdown in terms of the new builds in India. And it is partly driven by our view, a higher cost of capital kind of reviewing pricing and our overall appetite to invest in the market. It doesn't mean that those new builds might not accelerate again if the opportunities come through with some higher pricing and higher returns. But the -- we're focused on driving the highest returns on the opportunities that we have to build. But we are seeing kind of a reduction there in India. And it's not because the overall demand is down. It's really we're being very disciplined and patient. And we're also continuing to build towers in Europe and Africa and a handful in Latin America. So in this environment, we're just being very selective and putting our capital towards the sites that give us the highest growth, the highest risk-adjusted rates of return going forward, and we balance that with our desire to delever and prioritize some capital towards delevering this year and into next. Yes. I would say, I mean, we want to be opportunistic there. But we're also -- we want to get down below 5 times. There's a combination of a couple of things, Rick. I think you want to watch where our leverage is getting down below 5 times. I've said in the past and we continue to be ahead of the delevering schedule with the rating agency. So from that perspective, where we sit today, we're very comfortable. We want to accelerate that delevering and get down below 5 times well ahead of the rating agency agreed plan because of the uncertainty around interest rates and the high cost of carrying debt these days as you've all experienced. So you want to watch kind of where our leverage goes and the closer we get to 5 times, the lower that overall leverage gets. And certainly, when it gets down below 5 times, we might hit a little bit more flexibility kind of in our capital allocation.  The other thing that we are watching is the rate environment and where that goes, and when there will be a little less uncertainty around rates. And when they peak and begin to come down, we're not making any bets on when that will happen, but that will be something we continue to watch. And depending on how that unfolds, we may be able to prioritize buybacks sooner rather than later or maybe not if rates continue to stay high and this continued uncertainty. So we'll be watching both the rate environment here in the U.S. And as you know, we do a lot of borrowing in Euro denominated debt as well, and we'll be looking at our overall leverage. Hopefully, that helps. And of course, the share price is part of that as well. Hey Greg, thanks for the question. Regarding the cadence here, I think you do want to plan for that lower 50 certainly by the time you get out to Q4. We'll see a slight deceleration from Q3 to Q4. So maybe you're up in the mid-50s and the low 50s by the time you get to Q4, but that's what we do expect and see in terms of the new business in the U.S. going forward. And it's very in line with kind of that 220, 220 plus sort of range. So we're certainly very happy with that, and it drives about a 5% new business growth contribution to that overall organic tenant balance growth.  And then in terms of the DoD and the spectrum, we're not seeing a lot of that. I'm not sure, Greg, if I would go out and say that, that upside is certainly not in the short term, if it would, it would probably be clearly small here this year. We wouldn't expect to see much of an impact. And to the extent that it is deployed later some of that may be within our holistic agreements as well with certain carriers. You are welcome. Hey Batya, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. I think when you think about data centers, we're happy with the scale that we have. We've got great facilities, 28 facilities across really eight key markets. Their eco -- the ecosystem there is very rich with cloud on-ramps and network companies and enterprise customers. And it really gives us kind of the backdrop and the footprint that we need. And we're not seeing any headwinds because of a lack of scale. So all the great financial results that we're seeing, we're able to do it, because of the quality of the ecosystem and the way that these facilities are distributed throughout the U.S. So from that perspective, we feel really good with our data center investment to date. Now certainly, adding a location here or there, you've seen us do that a little bit even before we bought CoreSite. That certainly could be in the cards going forward. But we really do like the assets we have. We're not overly focused on trying to ramp up the scale as we've talked about in the past. When it comes to services, I would say we are seeing a slowdown -- it's -- I don't know if abrupt is the right word to use there, but we did see kind of a slowdown. I wouldn't say that it's across the board. I don't want to get into specific carrier by carrier, of course. But some carriers continue to plug right along and others have slowed down a little bit. Again, it's not unexpected from our view. When it comes to the final part of your question, in terms of the construction services, that's always been a pretty small part of our business. We've been maybe a little different than some of our competitors from that perspective. It is a small piece and it continues to be a small piece of our business. Most of what we do is in the permitting zoning engineering kind of those preconstruction activities. We do some construction services and deployment but not a lot. You are welcome. No, Richard, I would say we're really not. I mean we have long-term leases on the vast majority of these sites. We either own or have 20-year leases on more than 70% of our sites approaching 75%. So we're in good shape from that perspective. And we do a lot of work well ahead of expirations of the ground leases to renew these things and kind of move the exploration data out or buy the land through our capital program. So we don't see and we're really not exposed to any short-term significant spikes in land rent because of an inflationary environment. On average, our land goes up in line with our revenue in that 3%, 3% to 4% range. You are welcome."

            "name": "Tom Bartlett",
            "content": "Thanks Adam and thanks to everyone for joining this morning\u2019s call. Consistent with our past practice my comments today will focus on our international segment which consists of a well-diversified, high growth portfolio of assets across key developed and emerging geographies outside of the United States. Before diving into our international operations though and in light of the recent excitement surrounding the potential arising from AI workloads, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting the demand we're seeing in our CoreSite data center business, where we've seen 9% year-over-year growth, in both revenue and operating profit for the first six months of the year. Following record levels of signing new business in 2022 and Q1 of 2023, we continue to see demand for data centers outstripping supply in our initial underwriting expectations, elevated pre-leasing in a pipeline that points to an extended opportunity for increasingly profitable growth.  Each of these factors is contributing to strong pricing trends, and the ability to be selective in terms of signing new logos and expansions from existing customers, ensuring accretion to the value of the interconnection ecosystem and overall AFFO growth, particularly once we begin commencing the remainder of the record new business we've signed over the last year and a half. This is all before factoring in expectations for elevated demand from AI used cases. While much of the immediate demand in the market today is coming from hyper scale requirements, the longer term opportunity for interconnection hub like CoreSite, is just as significant and is arising from several key demand drivers.  First, we've already seen an acceleration in outsourcing to CoreSite as hybrid IT and multi cloud access are becoming more relevant for continued digital transformation across all workloads. As enterprises increasingly leverage new generative AI models for business and customer applications, they'll need to deploy servers that require more power and cooling than on premises data centers can typically handle. At the same time, we expect existing enterprise customers who are building AI into their products and operating models will expand their power and space requirements in CoreSite with its flexible and scalable model and speed to market benefits, is already well positioned to support these expected used cases today.  Second, we're seeing today's cloud enabled large language models requiring connections to proprietary distributed datasets use for training, which CoreSite as an interconnection ecosystem with a nationwide distribution of cloud on-ramps is well situated to serve. And finally we see a significant incremental opportunity arising from the use of hybrid and custom large language models for training and inferencing where low latency, high power density and distributed high performance compute is expected to result in elevated activity across our existing CoreSite campus footprint. Over time, we see a potential for these dynamic requirements to push demand for a more distributed compute infrastructure for which our CoreSite portfolio and ultimately our distributed footprint of land parcels on the Tower sites may be ideal locations over the long-term.  Simply put, the ongoing demand trends in the data center space and the emergence of generative AI used cases are providing American Tower from CoreSite an opportunity to play a central role as an infrastructure provider against a backdrop of technology evolution that's expected to drive a step up function increasing computing power demand. As a result, we see a compelling opportunity to continue delivering the industry leading yields on invested capital that CoreSite has historically achieved which Rod will touch on more later.  With that, let's turn to our international Tower business, where our objectives have remained clear, since we began expansion over two decades ago, leverage our proven capabilities and expertise to selectively invest in the world's largest free market democracies with regulatory structures that are supportive of the neutral host tower model, healthy competitive wireless industries, and high quality assets and counterparties. At the same time we focused on investing in markets that are in various stages of network technology development, and where we see a path to establishing nationwide scale. By bringing these factors together, we believe we could both augment and extend our growth trajectory, leverage our platform and expertise to create incremental value in selected markets, and add to an already compelling total return profile for American Tower shareholders.  As a critical component of this portfolio management and capital allocation program, we measure and analyze our assets on an ongoing basis to ensure the marriage identified and our initial investment underwriting remained consistent today. As you've seen recently, such evaluation has led to select divestitures including our Mexico fiber business and operations in Poland and a strategic review of our India business. The takeaways from these analyses together with our on the ground experiences across our global business continue to shape and evolve our approach to capital allocation. And the criteria we use to support ongoing capital investment and the setting of appropriate risk adjusted rates of return.  Today, we have a leading international portfolio of nearly 183,000 sites that are contributing approximately 45% and 36% towards consolidated property revenues and operating profit respectively, and are expected to deliver more than 8.5% in total tenant billings growth, including greater than a 6.5% organic growth in 2023. The secular demand trends driving our international growth remained consistent. Similar to the U.S., industry estimates forecasts roughly $35 billion in carrier CAPEX across our non-U.S. markets in 2023 and forecast suggest mobile data consumption is set to grow in the 20% to 30% range on average in these markets over the next several years, which would mark a continuation of the trends we've seen over the better part of the last two decades.  Globally, we've anchored our portfolio in key markets, which are in varying stages of network development relative to that of the U.S., where some level of 5G coverage deployed over a combination of low and mid band spectrum has reached approximately 95% of the population. In Europe, that number is closer to 60%, while Africa and Latin America are closer to 7% to 8%, suggesting a long tail of 5G and other next generation technology investments requiring significant incremental network density and sell side points of presence. Critical to our expansion strategy has been our discipline in establishing appropriate contract structures with the leading M&A [ph] in each geography. Although we've experienced certain consolidation driven churn events across our international portfolios over the past several years, we believe that through our proactive steps to increase exposure to leading multinational counterparties, we strategically reset our international customer base, enhancing the quality of our earnings and predictability of growth.  In fact, in Africa, approximately 90% of our Q2 property revenues are derived by market leaders Airtel, MTN, Vodafone, and Orange, as compared to roughly 80%, five years ago. In Europe, we similarly see over 80% of property revenue supported by Telefonica, Orange, Vodafone, and Deutsche Telekom versus less than 60% at the same time in 2018. In Latin America, which has a more fragmented customer base, given our operations across eight markets, we're still generating approximately 75% of our property revenues from Telefonica, At&T, American mobile, and Tim, up from a little over 60% over the same time period.  In addition to focusing on partnerships with market leaders, we've underwritten attractive leasing terms, including real estate REITs, and CPI linked escalators in the vast majority of our contracts outside of India. This disciplined approach to securing growth and critical contract terms is evident in our results in Q2, with a combination of gross organic new business and our escalator generated just under 13.5% growth in aggregate for Latin America, Europe, and Africa, roughly 300 basis points over our trailing five-year average. This reflects our ability to complement new site leasing with attractive amendment growth across our international operations, as we've done in the U.S. historically. In fact, looking again at Latin America, Europe, and Africa, of the roughly $100 million we've generated through colocation and amendment growth over the past 12 months, around half, both in each region and in the aggregate has come in the form of amendments, illustrating our ability to monetize various stages of network investment cycles, and our success in franchising our proven U.S. tower model throughout our global operations.  There's perhaps no better example of the benefits of remaining disciplined in terms of contract structure in Europe, where over the last several quarters, CPI linked escalators in Germany and Spain have provided a boost to our organic growth profile. And where again, roughly half of our new business growth has been driven by 5G related amendment activity on existing sites. In 2023, these factors as well as a healthy leasing environment are coming together to derive an expectation of approximately 8% organic kind of Billings growth in Europe, including an expectation for an acceleration in growth from colocations as we exit the year. As the 5G investment cycle continues our contract structures along with our work to develop leading operating capabilities in the region, and an ongoing expectation for low churn should allow us to deliver solid organic growth in the region for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the importance of the scale we built as a distinct competitive advantage has never been clear.  To our global diversified presence, and decades long track record of operational excellence, we've established American Tower as a trusted, strategic partner for our customers. This is exemplified by our new build program, where we partnered with leading carriers to rapidly deploy new sites, which has driven some of our highest returns on invested capital. In fact, since we began expanding internationally, we have built over 45,000 international sites, which are achieving a NOI yield of approximately 25%. And approximately 65% of these sites have been built since the start of 2017 alone shortly after we crossed the 100,000 international site mark. Nearly 8000 of these sites have been built in Africa, where our scale presence and strategic relationships with key wireless operators have afforded us the opportunity to build several 1000 new sites in recent years, that typically deliver mid teen yields on day one.  As we continue to augment our scale in key markets across the region, 4G investments, which are very much in the middle innings today are driving compelling organic tenant billings growth and our existing assets, including an expectation for greater than 11% growth in 2023, of which approximately 7% is coming from colocation and amendments, the highest of any region. And as the 4G cycle rounds out over the next few years, and we move toward 5G and the densification requirements that come with it, we expect capacity utilization across the assets we've built over the last several years to result in ongoing compelling growth.  Meanwhile, our regional scale and leading capabilities have resulted in the opportunity to invest in accretive platform extensions, such as our power as a service program in Africa. As you'll see in our recently published sustainability report, through 2022 we've invested approximately $345 million in this program, primarily in solar arrays and lithium ion battery solutions. As a result, we decreased annual diesel consumption at our sites in the region by an estimated 43.5 million liters when compared to business as usual operations and we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per tower by 21%, against our 2019 baseline. Based on the demand to extend this program, it seems clear that this solution provides compelling differentiated value to our customers.  At the same time, the program advances our progress toward meeting our science based targets and supports our customers network sustainability goals. Meanwhile, similar to our new build program, these investments have been among the highest return opportunities we've seen. And as more power intensive 5G begins to be deployed at scale more broadly, we believe we'll be well positioned to continue extending the reach of this high return program to new geographies over time. Finally, we're more focused than ever, on leveraging the benefits of our scale to maximize the margin profile of the business. For example, through our Global Business Services Organization, we've invested in standardization across lease management and other transactional processes that's driving both significant increase in productivity and run rate savings on an annual basis. Through our procurement organization we will begin to truly leverage our scale as a buyer to reduce input costs in our build to suit programs. Drive cost optimization when it comes to power and energy components and work with other critical vendors in our supply chain to realize incremental efficiencies. And while we're beginning to see the benefits of these and many other initiatives in our operations today, we believe we have a significant opportunity to transform our organization into one that is truly global, and capable of maximizing the operating leverage inherent to the business to expand on an already attractive margin profile.  In summary, we believe our global platform of assets is exceptionally positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a massive wave of incremental infrastructure demand required to support the technological advancements and network capabilities we're beginning to see in the market today. By complementing our U.S. platform, with a continued disciplined approach to international growth, and a focus on leveraging our scale, capabilities and learnings from over two decades of international U.S. operations we can provide compelling growth and margin expansion, and augmented return opportunity for investors, and a differentiated value proposition for our customers for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to go through the quarterly results and updated outlook. Eric, maybe I'll start this one, and then Rod can finish on. I think the mix of customers has actually been pretty consistent across the cloud and enterprise and the network. I think as Rod mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see a kind of record levels of cash backlog that's contracted revenue that's going to hit a balance of this year and into 2024 and a little bit into 2025. We see a pipeline that's up roughly 70%. We see pricing and it's up 15% on a year-over-year basis. Even the renewal rate, the MLR [ph] renewal rates is up at the 7% level. So there is a significant demand for these assets. We have a significant amount under development and a significant amount in the pipeline. So we're really outpacing the way we even underwrote the transaction to begin with. So really pleased with what we're seeing across the data center platform. Yes, Simon, I think I'll just underscore. I think it comes back to what Rod's saying is that there's nothing strategic out there. There's nothing compelling. We find it much more advantageous to invest in our own business that is through deleveraging, that is through investing through our capital. That's through buying back shares, I mean, given where we're trading. So we find it much more valuable to allocate our capital that way at this point in time than anything we see out in the market. Hey Michael, maybe I'll start and then Rod can kind of kick in. And the types of questions you're asking for, I think, are probably more appropriate for them. We've seen T-Mobile come out and say they're rolling out more carriers. We've seen Verizon talk about their deployment and looking for more mid-band and how that's going to drive kind of the second wave. But I think if you kind of step back, the pullback that we're seeing in spending today is absolutely reflective of the cadence of network investment cycles that we've seen historically. I mean you and I have both been around long enough to see most of them and meet all of them and how that cadence has progressed. And the 5G cycle is no different, at least from my perspective, than what we saw with prior cycles.  I mean it -- when we looked at our long-term growth expectations for U.S. and Canada in 2021, we had and had anticipated having those comprehensive MLAs in place. And so it's obviously kind of straight line what we are looking at in terms of our overall growth and protects from -- as we've talked about this kind of signed wave, if you will, of development. But the cycles typically progress as there's a coverage cycle. It's what we've seen in past cycles, including 3G and 4G. It's an initial multiyear period of elevated coverage CAPEX, and it's tied to new G spectrum aimed at upgrading the existing infrastructure. It's largely cost based. I mean the carriers are dropping in new technology to bring down their overall cost per bit as well as then positioning themselves to be able to offer their customers, their consumers and enterprise customers more technology and more capability. It's then followed by some grooming that will go on. And perhaps that's kind of the stage that we're starting to see ourselves in at this point in time.  And then later in the cycle, it will fill back into a capacity stage where we'll start to see more densification going on. And so when we think of kind of the services and the cadence, if you will, every time it is difficult to predict because the cycles from each of the customers are so different. As Rod said, the $175 million or so that we're looking to service, it is kind of the third -- largest on record. Last two years, we're up, I think, north of the $200 million range. But there still is a sizable year for our services business. So -- and our customers themselves are spending still record level versus where they were spending in 4G. So I know there's a lot of this anticipation of what's going on in 5G, why is this pull back and spend in 5G. I think we need to take a look at kind of a broader period of time here and saying, okay, our customers have deployed 5G to a large extent, they're continuing to deploy. We still do see obviously, services activity from all of them and we would expect to move through over the decade further levels of investment as they continue to drive more value for enterprises as well as then more value for consumers.  So I'm hopeful that our investor base doesn't get spooked by the fact that this is a pullback. It's very consistent. The cadence is really spot on with what we've seen with other technologies. And we're going to -- we continue, as well as any of our customers do, heavily investments in the 5G networks over time. I think relative to DISH, Dave has been a great partner of ours going forward as well as the entire business. So I'm sure while he will be missed I've got a great team in place there, Jonathan. So I don't think they're going to miss a beat. As I said, Dave is a great guy, really a great engineer, very, very technical and has been instrumental to driving the business. But they're a big business and like with ours. I mean, if we lost one person and that changed the direction of the business, that would be a sad thing. So they're a large institution, and I think they're well positioned and a good partner of ours. So I don't see any change there at all. With regard -- your first question, Jonathan, was? Right, right. A lot of it is a function of our own pricing increase that we put in place. I mean looking at the market, looking at the demand, they were initiated by ourselves. The volumes are robust, as I said, the pricing is up 15% above first half of 2022. The funnel was healthy. As a matter of fact, on the funnel on the $54 million, I think 80% of it is actually retail and scale. So largely enterprise driven as opposed to even having a major piece driven by the scale. And on the 7%, historically, we've been in that 2% to 4% rate. So very pleased with the fact of those renewal rates being up significantly above where we've been historically. Yes. We have a number of projects going on within the business, candidly, Jonathan. No news to report. Working on several different pilots with potential customers. As I mentioned in the past, we have a number of sites that are -- have a significant ability to add capacity of power at each one of them. So still very early days, early innings of that. Hopeful that AI inferencing in particular, will drive even more of that need out at the customer prem. So we continue to explore, continue to work through a number of different pilots and projects, but nothing new to report at this point. Yes. I mean, it depends -- it will be depending on the carrier, on the customer themselves. Typically, as we've said in the past, I mean, things happen in the form of sign ways. We see heavy build, then we'll see a lighter build as it gets filled. I mean the carriers aren't going to be spending the money ahead of time until they see the network demand. And so there will be certain locations, certain geographies, urban parts of the market, mortgage and is more of the suburban, where you can see shorter cycles on the grooming side. So it really depends on the customer. And it's -- you can't really come up with a kind of an average, if you will, overall."

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning. And thank you for joining American Tower\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning\u2019s call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. tower and data center businesses. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2023 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook; capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning\u2019s earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Bartlett: Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As is customary for our first quarter call, my comments today will focus on our U.S. business, which is principally comprised of our tower and data center platforms, which made up 55% of our consolidated property revenue and 64% of our property operating profit in the first quarter of 2023. With regard to our tower platform, the secular tailwinds that have supported outstanding growth over the last two decades remain consistent. Every year, U.S. wireless subscribers consume more mobile data through a growing number of devices and applications, requiring faster speeds and lower latency performance. As a result of the increasing levels of data being consumed, our customers are deploying more equipment on our towers to meet that demand. In addition, and more than ever before, our customers are utilizing multiple bands of spectrum to deliver those high-quality, ubiquitous levels of service. In 2022, U.S. carriers deployed around $40 billion in network capital to provide nationwide 5G services on mid-band spectrum. This record level of activity is reflective of the first major wave of the typical investment cycles we\u2019ve seen over the last 20 years, during which carriers amend existing sites to provide initial coverage and capacity with the new technology and harvest benefits from core network enhancements and spectral efficiencies. In previous cycles, these initial peaks have typically been followed by periods of moderation in overall spending, driven in part by reductions in spend on core upgrades, fiber and other infrastructure assets. However, we\u2019ve historically seen tower spend remain in focus as our customers look to support continuous growth in mobile data consumption and provide market-leading network quality and reliability. And we would expect more of the same over the 5G cycle. In 2023, while we\u2019re still in the relatively early stages of the overall 5G rollout, we continue to see customers making significant investments into their networks as part of their broader coverage initiatives, having yet to invest in densification at scale. These investments into adding and modifying equipment on our sites, which we\u2019ve monetized to our MLAs, is driving 5.6% organic growth in Q1 or nearly 7%, absent the impacts of the Sprint churn, our strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020. And for the full year, we expect $220 million in year-over-year growth contributions from colocations and amendments, a record for our U.S. business. Looking out over the next several years, we see an environment that is supportive of continued strong performance in the U.S. as the 5G investment cycle progresses and densification occurs. In American Tower, we\u2019ve underwritten this expectation into the comprehensive MLAs that underpin our expectation to deliver average annual organic growth of at least 5% or 6% excluding the Sprint churn over the next 5 years, which closely mirrors the 6.2% average organic growth we experienced between 2016 and 2020. Further, industry estimates suggest total monthly mobile data consumption that will require increased speed and lower latency is set to grow at a compounded annual rate of above 20% over the next five years, which we expect to be driven by continuous increases in mobile network utility, irrespective of potential impacts from any one category of new applications. As a result, we believe our customers\u2019 networks will need to provide at least 2 times the network capacity they have today in 3 to 4 years or roughly 3 times today\u2019s capacity as we approach the end of the decade. Over time, we expect our customers to meet this demand through continued network upgrade and densification initiatives, spectrum refarming and the deployment of 5G on new spectrum. In this context, we believe our portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to serve our customers across the balance of the 5G cycle with significant capacity to accommodate additional equipment and new tenancies even beyond what\u2019s been contractually locked in today. As we\u2019ve done historically, we anticipate leveraging our best-in-class internal processes to generate incremental efficiency in the business and higher levels of service for our customers with both resulting in increasing conversion of our top line growth to AFFO. Through a combination of organic growth and M&A, we\u2019ve added nearly $2.4 billion in annual property revenues to our U.S. and Canada segment since 2014, paired with less than $60 million in incremental SG&A expense or roughly 2% of the corresponding revenue growth. This prudent approach to cost management and operational efficiency has helped to drive operating profit margin expansion in the segment by roughly 400 basis points over the period. Going forward, given the benefits of our established scale, demonstrated ability to maximize the operating leverage potential inherent to our model and concerted efforts to further drive cost efficiencies at every level of the organization, we see a tremendous opportunity for capacity utilization in our existing assets to drive high-margin growth and expanding returns on invested capital as the 5G landscape continues to mature. Now, with respect to our CoreSite U.S. data center platform, we are equally excited about the prospects for value creation. Increasingly complex digital business demands require enhanced infrastructure performance and flexibility. CoreSite serves as an optimal nexus for the cloud service providers, service integrators, networks and enterprise customers inter-operate to propel their business initiatives forward. We continue to see customers landing and expanding with CoreSite because it provides native access to key cloud service platforms and a diverse ecosystem, which allows them to serve their customers in a way that is flexible, scalable and it drives growth and efficiency in their businesses. This is reflected in the continued strength of CoreSite\u2019s leasing results interconnection growth driven by both existing customers and new logos, as well as the ability to drive pricing, solid renewal rates and generate industry-leading returns. We also recognize that we\u2019re still in the early stages of a broader digital transformation movement. Each year, data center workloads and compute instances continue to grow at a rate of approximately 12% in the vast majority of all new IT architectures deployed into cloud and hybrid environments that CoreSite is uniquely positioned to support. Additionally, we continue to expect to generate long-term growth from enterprise digital transformations and IT hybridization as organizations face workload management challenges that require the operational -- optionality, agility and critical interconnection capabilities that our CoreSite data center platform offers. Importantly, the absorption of this type of demand drives incremental value to our interconnection ecosystem and further builds on the momentum behind the CoreSite flywheel and the value we can provide our customers. So, we see a long tail of opportunity to continue growing and scaling our campuses, and we have the added benefit of being able to prudently select opportunities that are accretive to our ecosystem. As a result, we\u2019ll continue to invest cash flows generated in the data center segment back into the business, provide our customers incremental confidence in a long runway for growth with CoreSite and generate highly attractive returns. Meanwhile, our teams continue working to develop solutions that leverage our combined communications real estate platforms to position American Tower as a leading infrastructure provider for the networks of the future and create incremental value for our customers and shareholders alike. In summary, our foundational U.S. tower and data center platforms are set to deliver continued growth and strong returns. We believe that the long-term secular tailwinds, the differentiated high-quality nature of both our U.S. tower portfolio and our data center interconnection platform, the value proposition they represent for our customers and the seasoned high talented teams managing them uniquely positions American Tower to create significant incremental value for the industry and our shareholders for many years to come. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our Q1 results and expectations for the balance of the year. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call. As you saw in our press release, we are off to a solid start to the year with performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. Before diving into the results and the revised outlook for 2023, I\u2019ll start with a few highlights from the quarter. First, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, strong demand trends continue to drive favorable leasing and growth across our global footprint, which is a testament to the resiliency and stability of our business. In Q1, we posted consolidated organic tenant billings growth of over 6%, our highest rate since 2017 and an over 300 basis-point acceleration as compared to Q1 of 2022. This includes growth through colocations and amendments of over 5%, our highest in three years, as carriers continue to leverage our leading macro tower portfolio to aggressively roll out their networks to meet customer demand. Organic leasing growth was further complemented by another quarter of strong new build volumes as we continue to leverage our scale and capabilities to attract accretive development opportunities from our leading customers across our international business. Finally, we had another record quarter of leasing from CoreSite, continuing the momentum from what was a record-breaking 2022 and exceeding our initial underwriting plan. Complementing our solid top line trends, our focus on cost management combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model, drove margin expansion of approximately 270 basis points as compared to Q1 of last year to 63.7%, with the benefits being more noticeable given the absence of material M&A. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to manage our business with cost discipline, maximizing the profitability of our strong reoccurring organic growth profile. Next, we access the debt capital markets, successfully issuing $1.5 billion in unsecured notes and $1.3 billion in secured notes at attractive terms. Proceeds from these offerings more than cover our Q1 maturities and the remainder together with the proceeds from various strategic initiatives, including the sale of the Mexico Fiber business, were used to pay down floating rate debt. As a result, we\u2019ve reduced our floating balance by nearly $800 million year-to-date, now representing slightly over 20% of our debt structure. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to further manage this balance over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to have constructive discussions with potential investors as we assess strategic options for our India business. We remain focused on executing an outcome that maximizes value and optimizes our global portfolio mix and the risk-adjusted return profile for American Tower and its stakeholders. As we move forward, we will keep our investors informed of any new developments. With that, please turn to slide 6, and I\u2019ll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you could see, Q1 consolidated property revenue growth was over 4% and approximately 7% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 4%, international growth of over 3% or nearly 9%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and approximately 10% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter, we benefited from accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, totaling approximately $39 million, partially offset by Vodafone Idea or VIL, revenue reserves of approximately $33 million, representing a modest improvement to payment trends as compared to the second half of 2022. Moving to the right side of the slide, organic tenant billings growth was a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth, standing at 6.4% on a consolidated basis, which as I mentioned, was our highest quarter since Q3 of 2017. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6% and nearly 7% absent Sprint-related churn, including a record quarter of colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million, a nearly 65% increase as compared to the growth reported in Q1 of 2022. Growth modestly exceeded our expectations, driven by some delays in churn, which we still anticipate to occur in the year and, to a lesser extent, new business upside. Similarly, our international operations experienced improvements across nearly all reported segments, generating organic tenant billings growth of 7.5% and over 180 basis-point acceleration from Q4 of 2022, which includes the benefits of CPI-linked escalator commencements across various contracts. Africa generated its highest quarter on record with organic tenant billings growth of 12.1%, including escalator contributions of over 10% and a continuation of solid new business of nearly 7%. Growth in the quarter benefited from some delays in previously communicated carrier consolidation-driven churn, which we still expect to occur in the year. Turning to Europe, we saw a growth of 8.2% and including over 6% from escalations, demonstrating our ability to monetize on CPI-linked escalators across the vast majority of our portfolio in the region. In Latin America, we saw a growth of 6.1%, which includes relatively consistent escalator and new business growth, partially offset by the continued elevated churn, as we\u2019ve highlighted on past calls. Churn in the quarter was favorable relative to our initial expectations as the decommissioning events have been slightly delayed to later in the year. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, we saw a growth of 3.4%, demonstrating steady improvement over the past three quarters. This growth acceleration was mainly driven by colocation and amendment contributions as carriers ramp up 5G deployments. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of over 1,300 sites in the quarter, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of exceeding 1,000 sites, primarily in Africa and Asia Pacific, as carriers continue to invest in their network coverage and densification needs across the regions. Initial returns remained solidly in the double digits with Q1 constructed sites yielding nearly 14% on day one. Turning to slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 9% to approximately $1.8 billion or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrated an approximately 270 basis-point improvement year-over-year to 63.7% and still an over 190 basis-point improvement when normalizing both periods of VIL-related revenue and bad debt reserves in India. This margin expansion was achieved through our continued focus on cost controls, allowing for approximately 100% conversion of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth. Again, on a normalized VIL basis and driving cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7.1% for the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO growth was 1.5%, while roughly flat on a per share basis, which includes financing cost headwinds of around 7.5% and 9.5% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, primarily driven by the rise in rates over the past year. Let\u2019s now turn to our revised full year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we had a strong first quarter, outperforming our initial expectations across the majority of our key metrics. While we are excited about the results to date and the sustainable demand trends that underpinned our performance, we have largely kept core and full year assumptions consistent to our prior guide, given our early position in the year and some of the timing benefits I alluded to earlier. This approach for our Q1 guidance is relatively consistent to past years. This also includes our assumptions around VIL-related revenue reserves, which we\u2019ve held at $75 million for the year. As noted earlier, we did record approximately $33 million in VIL reserves in Q1 with the guide applying an improvement for the duration of the year, notably in the back half. This assumption is supported by certain factors that we\u2019ve considered in our risk assessment, including the customers\u2019 contractual obligations for 2023, our latest conversations with VIL management, where they\u2019ve committed to meet these contractual obligations, and a demonstrated improvement in payments by the customer in Q1 relative to the second half of 2022. Key updates to our revised outlook include the impacts from the recent sale of the fiber business in Mexico, together with the upsides from FX derived using our standard methodology and several small adjustments below EBITDA at the attributable AFFO level. With that, let\u2019s dive into the numbers. Turning to slide 8. We are reducing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million versus our prior outlook, driven by $45 million related to the sale of the fiber business in Mexico, partially offset by $25 million associated with the positive impacts of FX. Moving to slide 9. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across our regions, and we\u2019ll continue to assess the positive momentum coming from our strong first quarter as we work further into the year. Moving on to slide 10. We are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook with a decline of approximately $25 million related to the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by $25 million from positive impacts of FX. Turning to slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $20 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.05 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.65 per share. Updates to our expectations, aside from FX, include the cash adjusted EBITDA reduction driven by the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by favorable net interest in part due to the use of the sale proceeds to pay down debt and some cash tax savings. On an isolated basis, the Mexico Fiber sale resulted in a $15 million decline to attributable AFFO as compared to our prior outlook midpoint. Moving on to slide 12. I\u2019ll review our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities for 2023. Beginning on the left side of the slide, our capital allocation priorities for 2023 remain consistent with our prior outlook, which includes approximately $3 billion towards our common dividend, subject to Board approval, representing 10% growth year-over-year on a per share basis. In addition, our CapEx outlook midpoints remain unchanged across all categories and support our initial plans to construct approximately 4,000 new sites across our international footprint. Moving to the right side of the slide. And as I highlighted earlier, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet in the first three months of the year, extending our average maturity profile to nearly six years, while reducing our floating rate debt balance to slightly over 20%. Additionally, we closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.2 times, well on track towards our deleveraging target of 3 to 5 times. Consistent with our past remarks, we remain focused on driving shareholder value through our growing dividend and accretive CapEx program while strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging, maximizing liquidity, managing a diverse pool of capital sources and an ongoing assessment of market conditions to potentially further term out floating rate debt and extend our maturity profile. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. Q1 was another strong quarter across our business with incremental steps taken towards strengthening our balance sheet. Underpinned by sustained demand trends across our global footprint, our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets generated accelerating leasing growth, while our capabilities as an operator and partner continue to afford us opportunities to deploy accretive capital to its high-yielding development projects. We believe we are well positioned to drive compelling growth, supported by attractive secular trends across our global footprint and deliver solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to the line of Brett Feldman. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: I was hoping I can ask about some background on the sale of the Mexican fiber asset. What led to that? Was that something you were actively shopping, or was there an inbound that came there? And then if we maybe just take a higher-level approach to this. You gave us an update you\u2019re considering and evaluating a potential equity sale in the India business. You just sold a piece of your Mexican business. Are you undertaking a broader portfolio rationalization strategy? And if that is the case or even if it was just India, where you would pull some additional proceeds in, how do we think about applying those proceeds especially now that you\u2019re getting close to the high end of your target leverage range? Thank you.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. Hey Brett, I\u2019ll start, and Rod can also obviously add on here. We look at every one of our assets in our markets repeatedly. And continually, you\u2019re looking at where are the best rates of return that we can drive, are there better places for us to reallocate capital. And so, this is -- it\u2019s an ongoing process that we do internally. We also do it with our Board every year as well. And the business that we\u2019ve had in -- the fiber business that we\u2019ve had in Mexico, we\u2019ve had for several years, was really part of our kind of initial innovation and platform extension approach. And the piece of that particular business was just a business that we couldn\u2019t generate the kinds of returns on that we had expected. And we felt that it would be a better -- could be in better hands with somebody who had broader scale in the marketplace. And so, as a result of our kind of ongoing review, it was a business that we\u2019ve actively marketed over the last several months. And this is consistent with how we\u2019re thinking about even a market like India, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. It goes through that same kind of disciplined approach that we have. And we look at, okay, in each given market, again, like India, is there a better place to be able to reallocate some of that capital or invest in other products and services. And so, that\u2019s the process that we\u2019re going through right now. And Rod and I talked about it on the last call with you all. And we\u2019ll look to, as we did with the fiber, I mean, our goal from a balance sheet perspective is to delever, as we\u2019ve talked about right now, and we use those proceeds from the fiber sale to do just that. And we will continue to look at kind of delevering the balance sheet really over the next 12 to 18 months until we get it to a spot that we\u2019re really comfortable with.\nRod Smith: Brad, if I could just add a couple of points there. Thanks for the question. You see in our quarterly numbers here, we got our leverage down to 5.2% (sic) [5.2x]. And of course, as constant, we did use the proceeds from the fiber business to pay down debt, not just to delever, but to actually reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, which we did, and we\u2019re down around that 20% number. And that really shows our commitment to our investment-grade balance sheet in this environment, looking to delever. That\u2019s definitely top of the list when it comes to capital allocation once you get beyond paying the dividend and the dividend growth that we have. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on delevering the business until we get down within our target range of 3 to 5 times. And we\u2019re also continuing to focus on reducing our exposure to floating rate debt. So, we\u2019re within our policy now right at about 20%. But we\u2019re going to be looking at that and working to try to reduce that exposure on the floating rate side even more than that in the coming quarter. So, you\u2019ll see us pretty active in that space.\nBrett Feldman: Great. If you don\u2019t mind as a quick follow-up question. I mean, just being at 5.2 turns, which is so close to the high end of your range. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would take 12 to 18 months to get into that target range. And so, is the right interpretation of that statement to say that in this environment, all things being equal, you would likely just continue to delever and particularly to pay down floating rate debt absent something that\u2019s highly compelling, meaning you may drift below 5 times and closer to 3 times, if that\u2019s just the case?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, absolutely, Brett. You\u2019re exactly right. And now whether we go back down to 3 times, it could be a bit of a stretch. But clearly, we want to get sub-5. And as Rod said, we really do want to lessen the exposure to the floating rate debt that we have on the balance sheet.\nRod Smith: One thing, Brett, that I\u2019ll just alert you to is don\u2019t be surprised if you see the 5 float back up a little bit, even maybe a 5.3 in the coming quarters before you see it trending back down. That will just be a function of kind of where our EBITDA -- our quarterly annualized EBITDA might end up landing. But that should not make you think that our commitment to delevering isn\u2019t as strong as we\u2019re suggesting it is, because it is, but you may see it flow back up just a touch before you see it come back down.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nLandon Park: Good morning. This is Landon Park on for Simon. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019m wondering if we can start on the data center side. You mentioned another record bookings quarter for CoreSite. Can you maybe provide any more color there in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the market and where that demand is coming from? And on the data center side, can you give us an update on your edge data center project that you were trying to get built out this year to start scaling on that front?\nTom Bartlett: Yes, sure. Let me start, and then Rod, you can continue -- or can add to it. To continue -- continuation of what we saw in 2022. I mean, the demand from -- for the kind of the digital infrastructure that we have just continues to be strong throughout the country. And it\u2019s a really nice balance between enterprise accounts, between operators as well as the cloud. So, the pipeline remains really healthy, and we\u2019ve been able and have taken advantage of the opportunity to capture some strong pricing actions throughout the year, particularly as we really continue to drive all the interconnection growth. So, we\u2019re really pleased with what the team has done, with the types of business that they\u2019ve generated, and it really resulted again in a really strong Q1, and we continue to have really strong expectations for the business going forward. With regards to kind of all of the edge work, we continue to work internally on identifying particular locations where we can actually drive 1 meg or 2 meg of power. We have a number of sites that are shovel-ready at this point, and we\u2019re looking to move on them. We continue to have conversations with all the service operators as well as the hyperscalers and all the cloud players to continue to move forward and figure out that value proposition that we think can be a profitable one for all of us. And so, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s still early stages of it, but we continue to remain really excited about the ultimate opportunity.\nLandon Park: And just one follow-up on that. Where are you at in terms of the design phase for that sort of edge data center that you guys were hoping, I think, to design this year and something that could be scaled relatively easily going forward?\nTom Bartlett: From a design and engineering perspective, we really have the specs really well laid out such that, as I said before, we\u2019re shovel-ready on a couple of locations to start to deploy it. And so, the teams know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like, have identified who the vendors are that are going to be providing a lot of the resources and pieces of it. And so, we\u2019re really far along on the overall design.\nLandon Park: What does the cost per megawatt look like for that design?\nTom Bartlett: I don\u2019t know that I want to get into -- at this point in time. When we\u2019re ready to roll it and deploy it, we can give more -- we\u2019ll give more specifics as to the overall economics.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRick Prentiss: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I want to follow up on Brett\u2019s question a little bit on the Mexico Fiber sale. Let\u2019s go deeper into what lessons that you learned there. I think you were hoping to see some small cell. But is it just that the fiber business is dramatically different than the power business and small cells weren\u2019t playing. But what specifically did you learn? And I got a U.S. question.\nTom Bartlett: Rick, it\u2019s consistent with some of the experiences candidly that we\u2019ve had in the past in the business, and we thought we might be able to do things differently and unique. That particular asset came with at tens of thousands of sites in Mexico City, which was also very interesting to it and remains very interesting to us, and we still have the right to those particular assets as our customers deploy and densify in Region IX or in Mexico City itself. But what we continue to learn on the retail side, just how difficult it is to be able to provision circuits and make money, providing lit services to enterprise accounts and then just how competitive it is. And the SLAs that go along with them, how difficult it is to be able to maintain them in a very profitable manner. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of competition in the marketplace. And so, as a result, it just makes sense for us to put those particular capabilities in the hands of somebody that just does that 24/7. And hopefully, they will find more success there. But it\u2019s consistent with what we see in the fiber business in all of our markets, including the U.S., where we think that there\u2019s really an opportunity for fiber is when you\u2019re bringing it to the tower. That\u2019s kind of a slam dunk for us because that\u2019s obviously improving the capability and the capacity of a particular site. So, when we start to get into the retail aspects of it, it\u2019s just such a competitive, capital intensive, low margin opportunity that it just made sense for us to move out of it.\nRick Prentiss: In this debt environment, good to reduce your floating rate and save some interest. On the U.S. side, can you update us as far as in aggregate what kind of percent of your towers do you think have been touched with mid-band spectrum by the carriers. And we\u2019ve heard a lot of talk that private networks are going slowly, but starting to ramp, but that some of the carriers are wanting to see private networks before we get to the edge. So just trying to gauge in the U.S. where we\u2019re at as far as mid-band touches and what you\u2019re seeing on private networks.\nTom Bartlett: Yes. I mean, Rick, it still is in that kind of that 50% range. Some are a bit higher, some are a bit lower. But in the aggregate, it\u2019s at that 50% range I think that have been touched. Again, it\u2019s largely been coverage. There are some pockets of densification going on, still largely amendment-driven, if you will, in terms of getting that ubiquitous coverage on a nationwide basis. So the carriers all remain active. And as Rod mentioned, the overall capital spend, we expect it to be lower in \u201823 versus \u201822. But as you well know, our comprehensive MLAs really protect us from that type of volatility, if you will. And so, while the carriers may spend at different levels on a consolidated basis, slowed down a bit as would be expected in \u201823, we really are protected from that. On the private side, yes, there is a lot more dialogue going on candidly relative to private networks. I mean I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a surge of deployments. But I do see our sales teams entering into different types of conversations with carriers, enterprises, looking at deploying kind of private 5G types of networks. We have some that we\u2019re experimenting with and deploying. I think there\u2019s more to come on that. But clearly, 5G, I think, plays -- will play a significant role in developing that aspect of the market.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Just following up on the domestic leasing environment. Curious how much of the leasing strength is coming from outside of the big three national wireless carriers? And what\u2019s the sensitivity to performance, both for \u201823 and as you look out to your multiyear guidance, if that activity from these others, which could include DISH, were to significantly increase or significantly decrease? And then if I could just throw in a second question, the common theme from some of the market-by-market commentary with delay of churn. And so just curious if there\u2019s more to unpack in what\u2019s causing those delays in certain markets. And if those delays should help the \u201823 outlook and just be something we should be considerate of in terms of a possible headwind for part of 2024? Thanks.\nRod Smith: Hey, Michael. Good morning. Thanks for joining, and thanks for the question. We\u2019ve talked about in the past we are seeing an acceleration in the leasing environment in the U.S. in terms of our numbers and specifically the incremental revenue that we\u2019re seeing from new business coming from colocations and amendment. So, we had a really strong quarter in Q1 in the U.S. We booked about $60 million of incremental colocation amendment revenue. That\u2019s well on track to achieve our $220 million target for the year, which is a nice step-up over last year, which was about $150 million. So, that\u2019s the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing. That is primarily coming from the primary carriers, the big three certainly. And DISH is also a contributor in that. And I think you know and most everyone on the call knows that we have holistic deals with the carriers in the U. S. environment. So not that we\u2019ll go through any specifics with how they work carrier by carrier, but what it does is it has our revenue contracted in there. So, we have about 90% of our revenue and revenue growth for this year fully contracted, and there\u2019s no variability in that. So, we feel really good about that. And then when you look at the long-term going out through 2027, you\u2019ve heard us talk about that 5% on average OTBG in the U.S. We have about 75% visibility out over that long period of time of the underlying revenue as colored for revenue growth. So we feel really good about that. But the vast majority of that activity is the big three plus DISH. Certainly, we have kind of this other category with some broadcasters, some local independent radio companies and other people that use our towers like government agencies. And they always contribute a piece there, and they\u2019re kind of in the range that they\u2019ve always been at. But the vast majority really is the big guys in the U.S. When you think about churn, we did have delays in churn, which helps support our growth rates for the quarter. So, we\u2019re up to about 6.4%. Our churn came in at about 3.4% for the quarter. And the places where it\u2019s noticeable, it\u2019s a slight improvement in the U.S. because of churn, but that\u2019s not the biggest piece. It\u2019s probably more dropping down into Latin America. Within our overall guide for Latin America, we had 8 percentage points in for churn. And that is primarily coming from two big carriers: Telefonica, which everyone knows what\u2019s happening with Telefonica in Mexico as well as Oi down in Brazil. Oi represents about 2% within that 8%. And what\u2019s happening is just the delay. So we fully expect the churn for the Telefonica churn as well as the Oi churn to kind of catch up here during the year. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing a change to our organic tenant billings outlook for the full year. So, we do expect to kind of catch up with that. So, we\u2019ll take the positive benefits for Q1, and we\u2019re still kind of being realistic and maybe a little conservative in terms of keeping our organic tenant billings growth consistent. But that\u2019s really where it is. We also have elevated churn in Africa with Cell C down in South Africa and even AirtelTigo over in Ghana. And again, we\u2019re not changing our full year outlook with just the timing is moving around just a bit.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on India, if there\u2019s any more color you can give or update in terms of where that process is and when you may expect to have that resolved. And then, maybe to dovetail on the prior question, obviously, this year has been impacted by interest, FX, some VIL reserves. As we kind of move past that, is high-single-digit type AFFO per share growth maybe a more viable aspirational target to consider in 2024 onwards, or are there other maybe headwinds we should be contemplating as we start to roll the calendar? Thanks.\nRod Smith: Let me hit the India process first, and then I\u2019ll jump into the next question. So, we are running a process, as Tom and I have talked about here on this call and in the prior call. It\u2019s very similar to the process we walked through when we sold an equity stake in our data center business in the U.S. as well as the European joint venture that we did. So, we\u2019ve gone out to the top couple dozen highly professional, large investors that are in the infrastructure space. Our goals remain the same that in the other transactions we did, really, which is to partner to or sell the equity to a very strong investor that understands the space that can help run the business, has government connection, has carrier connections, all those sorts of things. So bringing more than just capital, but also a willingness and some experience to be a strategic partner in the business. So that process continues. I would say at this point, it\u2019s progressing. And we\u2019ve got the list worked down from the full couple of dozen to a smaller list here, still very active. And I think we\u2019ll figure out where we head and what that transaction might look like in the coming quarter. So, there\u2019ll be more to update you on probably in the next call. But we\u2019ll be patient. We\u2019ll be opportunistic as we kind of work through it, and we\u2019ll see what the opportunities there look like. And when we decide what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019ll have the best interest of the shareholders in mind, of course, and as well as the employees and the customers there in India. But it\u2019s a very similar process that we\u2019ve kind of gone through before. I guess when you think about the -- jumping into the next question here in terms of AFFO. You know we have AFFO per share growth in our guide here that\u2019s a little less than zero, so a negative growth rate. And I\u2019ll just remind you that the headwinds there, as you highlighted, is really the financing interest cost, but also the issuance of the shares that we did middle of last year to help finance the CoreSite business as well as FX. So, we are seeing roughly an 8% headwind for the year around the financing pieces, including the spike in interest rates. We\u2019re seeing about a 1% headwind roughly on FX. And the VIL reserve that we\u2019re taking, that $75 million that we talked about, that represents about a 2% headwind as well. So, when you put all that together, the core underlying business is in fact growing in that 8% to 9% range this year. And we think that feels like a pretty good place for us. So to the extent that we drive 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S., we drive a little bit higher organic tenant billings growth in our international markets, we complement that with another 100 basis points or so with new builds. We expand margins as we drop down through the P&L. And then, we deployed capital in a prudent way. We certainly think that upper single-digit growth rate is achievable. Now with that said, there are a few things that could still be items that we need to watch. The VIL situation is a situation that\u2019s ongoing that we continue to -- the need to watch. We don\u2019t know exactly where interest rates will go. So, we\u2019re certainly being prudent in trying to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, get ahead of refinancings and reduce refinancing risk. And this year, we\u2019ve already issued just under $3 billion of new bonds, new notes. And that removes the refinancing risk from \u201823 entirely. Now, we\u2019re beginning to look at \u201824 to remove that. But you put all that together, as long as interest rates cooperate if that bag kind of hangs in there, which we\u2019re seeing favorability in the spot rates, so that\u2019s kind of trending in a good direction. If we sort out the VIL kind of India volatility, then upper single digits certainly is achievable in this business. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio of assets in a lot of really good places, and we\u2019ve got customers that are actively leasing the site. So, we feel really good about the core performance of this portfolio.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: So two, if I could. So first one for Rod. I just want to make sure I understand this Vodafone Idea situation. So, when we came out of the second half and you gave guidance for 2023, you said that you assumed that the collections rate would be roughly equivalent to the second half run rate for 2023. And that number was -- and then you changed to a cash accounting method maybe 70% to 80% of what you expected would be realized. And yet then you said today that you\u2019re actually in the first quarter had better-than-expected collections. But then you also made a provision, which was almost half the reserves that you expected for the whole year. So, I don\u2019t know if I understand how all that\u2019s working. So, if you can kind of help us through that and how it will work, that would be super helpful. And then the second piece would be, Tom, DISH, stock is hitting a 24-year low. The bonds are yielding 20% to 30% for the next three years. It\u2019s in a distressed position. And there\u2019s a lot of questions I field from people about kind of how comfortable you feel with your contractual relationship? How does that contribute to growth? And then for those of us who maybe aren\u2019t as grizzled as some of us veterans, how do you think if a bankruptcy emerged in the wireless space, how would that work in this day and age? Thanks.\nRod Smith: Hey David, good morning. I\u2019ll take the first one on Voda. So the collections rate that we\u2019re seeing in Q1, it\u2019s not better than our expectation. It\u2019s right in line with our expectation. We expect the level of collection that we had in Q1 to continue into Q2 as kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it. I\u2019m not sure if I heard all the detail in your question, but I\u2019ll try to clarify for you. That collections rate that we experienced in Q1 is slightly better than what we experienced in Q4 of last year and what we experienced in Q3 of last year. So that\u2019s where we talk about the improvement in terms of the collections from Vodafone. It\u2019s really the first half of this year, let\u2019s say, compared to the last half of last year. The other part of your question, I think it kind of leads into what\u2019s happening later in the year. And we do expect an improvement in collections from Vodafone as we enter into the second half of this year. And so, that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re looking. And we talk to Voda quite frequently. We have -- you have seen -- we\u2019ve seen that the government converted their equity. That does kind of clear the way a little bit for Voda to work on their balance sheet and to potentially raise equity and debt. And we gather that they\u2019re working aggressively on that. You may have seen a new Board appointment over in India. We think that\u2019s a really good fact as well. And we do believe that Voda management is committed to and capable of increasing their payments to us in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s reflected in our outlook. So that\u2019s kind of how those bits and pieces worth most of the $75 million serve that we have in there will be booked and realized in the first half of this year.\nTom Bartlett: Dave, with regards to DISH, they remain very active in the market. They are investing throughout the country to meet all of their FCC requirements. They\u2019re -- have always been a good partner. I have a lot of faith in their leadership team there in terms of being able to develop the network and drive strategies that make sense for them. So from our perspective, there has been a very strong player and a very strong partner. I\u2019m not going to speculate on bankruptcies and all the other types of things candidly. But just to let you know that I believe that they are really strong leadership team, really smart and being, I think, very intelligent in terms of how they\u2019re building out their network.\nDavid Barden: Tom, if I could just follow up. I think that there is a spectrum of relationships that tower companies have with DISH. Some are activity-related, some are kind of minimum take rates with contractual escalators and such. And I think that you\u2019re in the latter camp. Is that fair to say?\nTom Bartlett: I mean we\u2019ve been working with DISH for a number of years in terms of helping them look at the engineering of their network and building out their network. And I would say that our U.S. leadership team has had, I think, a really strong relationship with them right out of the gate. I can\u2019t speculate on other types of relationships with some of the other tower cos. But we\u2019ve been really comfortable with the relationship and how it\u2019s been built over the years. And I think that there\u2019s a mutual respect for -- between both entities.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi: Can you talk a little bit about how you will approach M&A? There seems to be a number of portfolios available in some of the Asian markets that you don\u2019t currently have a presence in and maybe some in Europe. If you could just talk about your interest and how you would prioritize portfolio growth in the next couple of years, that would be great. And a second question maybe just specifically in Europe. What do you see in terms of the carrier activity? And if there\u2019s any update on how one-on-one is contributing to your growth? And if they decide to grow the MVNO route, should we expect any impacts on your growth outlook? Thank you.\nRod Smith: Hey Batya, good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding M&A, our view today is consistent with where it\u2019s been in the last couple of -- the last few months, certainly the last couple of quarters, which is in this environment, given what\u2019s available and kind of the differences that we see in pricing between private tower sales and, let\u2019s say, public tower equities, along with some terms and conditions that, of course, are important, when you look at portfolio by portfolio and region by region, we continue to look at the pipeline. And in our evaluation, there\u2019s nothing in there that we see that\u2019s compelling at the moment. Nothing in there that we see that would require us or prompt us to make any kind of a move. So then we settle back in. And we\u2019re firmly kind of committed to our capital allocation approach here going forward. And one of the things that helps guide us is the uncertainty around rates and ensuring that we\u2019re reducing our leverage getting back below our 5 times in a prudent amount of time, also reducing that floating rate exposure, making sure we\u2019re aggressively managing interest rates along with providing a dividend and a growing dividend to our shareholders. So, when you look at the totality of opportunities available, we\u2019re fully committed to the dividend and dividend growth. Next, we allocate capital to our capital programs, our internal programs where we build towers. We\u2019ll build around 4,000 this year around the globe. Those come in at very high day one NOI yields, roughly mid-teens. 14% is the number for the -- for Q1. So, we feel that that\u2019s really good. We\u2019re also allocating some capital within our capital number for this year towards CoreSite in the mid-$300 million, let\u2019s call it, $360 million or so. And as we\u2019ve discussed, that\u2019s kind of within their cash flow generation. They produce EBITDA or gross margin, let\u2019s say, in the mid-400s. So we\u2019re comfortably kind of reinvesting -- their cash flow back into their business to make sure that we have capacity to continue to satisfy the customers and keep up with the record demand that we experienced last year in the first quarter of this year. And I\u2019ll highlight again for the folks on the call here that our capital program this year is slightly below last year, not materially below, but they\u2019re slightly below. And that\u2019s kind of a function of allocating capital towards balance sheet and reducing leverage and reducing our floating rate exposure. When you think about Europe and Asia, like we would want to be larger in there. We think that market is very constructive for us. We do think there are some interesting portfolios there, but nothing that we\u2019ve seen yet in terms of terms and conditions and pricing and all the different pieces lining up where it would need to be. And we don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. But over the next several years, let\u2019s call it, 2 to 5 years, Europe is a place where we could be active in looking at different portfolios. We think there\u2019s really good backdrop in Europe. With that said, if we don\u2019t buy anything in Europe, we\u2019ve got a really good portfolio and feel good about our position day one. And when you think of Asia where we spent a lot of time in the last couple of years looking at different transactions in Asia, and again, nothing kind of lined up and met our criteria. We\u2019re very-disciplined when it comes to pricing terms and conditions, counterparty and also country evaluations and things like that. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined. And I do think you\u2019ll see us be very committed to balance sheet, reducing leverage, reducing floating rate debt and not active in any major way in M&A in the near term. And then, maybe in Europe, the other thing just to hit your other question, we\u2019re seeing good activity across Europe. It\u2019s a -- when you think about Germany, kind of the center point that Drillisch 1&1 is just beginning to ramp up their network build in a full greenfield 5G build. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of revenue activity from that. But we\u2019re excited to support them in their endeavor to build out a network there. And we do think that we\u2019ll see more activity with them in the second half of this year and certainly in years to come. But then when you think about France and Germany and Spain across the board, we think there\u2019s a really good backdrop, a good set of counter-parties and carriers there for us to support. And we feel really good about the growth rates and our position within those markets. We guided when we did the Telxius transaction that we would be achieving mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth. We\u2019ve been above that since we acquired the portfolio in this year, we\u2019re again looking at upper single digits in that 7% to 8% range, which is a really nice place. We\u2019re benefited from the activity that we\u2019re seeing from the carriers in terms of the leasing. We\u2019re also benefited from the contract terms where we have untapped escalators in Germany and in Spain, which is very helpful. And then we\u2019re seeing very low churn rates again, because of the demand that we see from the carriers to build out networks and also the way the contracts work that we\u2019ve been able to negotiate. So, we feel really good about our position in Europe. We feel really good about our ability to support the carriers\u2019 endeavors to build out networks in Europe, and we think there are some good things to come in Europe.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBrandon Nispel: I guess when we look at the U. S. leasing colo line, $60 million I think was a record for the Company ever. Are we at the point where that colo number is peaking? And just because if we look at the midpoint of the guide $220 million, it would imply some deceleration. And then, can you just help us just refresh us in terms of how your master lease agreements work in terms of the use fee provided to your customers. I guess my understanding is in year one of those contracts, it\u2019s typically the highest use fee contribution and that those generally fall off as the term of the contract extends. But I was hoping you can help explain it for us. Thanks.\nRod Smith: So, you are correct in terms of the organic new bid, the incremental new bids we get from colocations and amendments. That $60 million number, we do see that at the peak for the year. But with that said, it will be -- we expect that number on a quarterly basis to be between $50 million and $60 million for the next three quarters for the full year. So, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re going to see a big drop off. It is pretty linear there the way things work. So -- but you will see it drift down a little bit, and that is kind of a function of the timing of the MLAs and the use right fees. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail about the contracts and the way the contracts work. But you can have timing differences here where you have use right fees that step up in a certain quarter. They\u2019re mostly front-end loaded. And then you also have the ability to get additional revenue over and above that, which can be more variable kind of throughout the quarter. I would say that that -- the $220 million that we\u2019re seeing this year, there is kind of a function there with the MLAs and kind of some of the transition period that we had kind of moving in and out of different MLAs, that does help support that number a bit. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that number is a little bit lower next year. But with that said, we\u2019re still seeing kind of the acceleration of that revenue kind of as we enter the beginning of this year. And again, it will taper off on a quarterly basis. But we\u2019ll hit the $220 million for the full year. That again is up almost 50% from the $150 million that we that we hit last year. And we continue to feel really good about everything that we see and work on in terms of the U.S. business being in a strong position to achieve 5% organic tenant billings growth on average out over the time period through 2027.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. That will come from the line of Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Maybe just quickly touching on the data center business, obviously, continuing to perform well. Maybe you could talk about the accelerated growth you\u2019re seeing there and kind of disaggregate it between just new leasing and then also pricing. We\u2019ve heard that supply is really historically tightened data centers and a lot of operators are continuing to push rents. And then you made a comment, I think, that you\u2019re seeing some pockets of densification in certain markets. Maybe you can talk about how you think the cadence of that evolves over the next few years, especially as some of the mid-band spectrum upgrades, amendment revenue starts to taper off in the next couple of years?\nRod Smith: So, we\u2019re very excited about the data center business that we have. I think you\u2019ve heard us say in the past that it\u2019s a differentiated set of assets to the extent that it\u2019s a cloud-rich standard facilities, multiple cloud on-ramps and lots of the facilities that we have, their network and lots of enterprise customers in there. And that really means there\u2019s a lot of interconnection. People come into these facilities for those multiple cloud on-ramps and to interconnect with everyone else, the cloud, the networking companies and the other enterprise companies. That is helping drive this record growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, as we\u2019ve talked about, we saw record new bids for CoreSite through the full year 2022. And we also saw a continuation of that where we had a record new business performance for Q1 kind of quarter-over-quarter from prior year, I should say, from Q1 of last year. So that strong performance certainly is continuing. That resulted in a 10% revenue growth year-on-year for that business. That\u2019s higher than what we underwrote that business for. We\u2019ve talked about kind of upper single-digit 6% to 8% economic growth in that set of assets. That\u2019s the way we underwrote it. And we outperformed last year. We\u2019ve got a really good start this year. Maybe that 10% thinks back a little bit. But we should be solidly in the upper single-digit growth rate and within our underwriting targets for that business. We\u2019re also seeing really strong growth in interconnection revenue, up about 9.5%. And that\u2019s really key because that really represents what these customers are doing within our facilities and why they\u2019re there. And it makes the revenue that we have a lot more durable, dependable and sticky because they\u2019ve got these relationships with other enterprise customers and into all these networking companies. So, that is a really good fact. We\u2019re also increasing prices within that market being sensitive to customers as well, but also trying to drive growth in that business and making sure we\u2019re getting the value that these assets are contributing to our customers. So, we continue to see cash mark-to-market increases in the 3% to 5% range, 3% to 4% range, which is -- which is going well. We have escalators in lots of our contracts, so we generally see a 3% escalator kind of in our underlying contracts. The churn rate continues to be in the mid-single digits in that business, in the 6.5% range, well within our 6% to 8% target. And our maintenance CapEx is right within our target range of about 2% of revenue, runs in between $20 million and $30 million a year. So, we\u2019re really pleased with the way that the team is running that business and the way those assets are performing for us. And quite frankly, what those assets do for our customers, which they\u2019re really important assets for the customers. And we\u2019re continuing at a gross margin that\u2019s almost 60%. So, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with the performance of the data center business and the future outlook, quite frankly, and the optionality that those assets provide us when you think about the edge and potentially connecting those assets into our towers and into edge compute facilities closer to our customers\u2019 base radios on the wireless side, but also closer to network companies as well as enterprise customers that are scattered throughout the U.S. So, that business and the future outlook there is really strong.\nAdam Smith: Great. Thank you everybody for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or the Investor Relations team. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call. As you saw in our press release, we are off to a solid start to the year with performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. Before diving into the results and the revised outlook for 2023, I\u2019ll start with a few highlights from the quarter. First, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, strong demand trends continue to drive favorable leasing and growth across our global footprint, which is a testament to the resiliency and stability of our business. In Q1, we posted consolidated organic tenant billings growth of over 6%, our highest rate since 2017 and an over 300 basis-point acceleration as compared to Q1 of 2022. This includes growth through colocations and amendments of over 5%, our highest in three years, as carriers continue to leverage our leading macro tower portfolio to aggressively roll out their networks to meet customer demand. Organic leasing growth was further complemented by another quarter of strong new build volumes as we continue to leverage our scale and capabilities to attract accretive development opportunities from our leading customers across our international business. Finally, we had another record quarter of leasing from CoreSite, continuing the momentum from what was a record-breaking 2022 and exceeding our initial underwriting plan. Complementing our solid top line trends, our focus on cost management combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model, drove margin expansion of approximately 270 basis points as compared to Q1 of last year to 63.7%, with the benefits being more noticeable given the absence of material M&A. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to manage our business with cost discipline, maximizing the profitability of our strong reoccurring organic growth profile. Next, we access the debt capital markets, successfully issuing $1.5 billion in unsecured notes and $1.3 billion in secured notes at attractive terms. Proceeds from these offerings more than cover our Q1 maturities and the remainder together with the proceeds from various strategic initiatives, including the sale of the Mexico Fiber business, were used to pay down floating rate debt. As a result, we\u2019ve reduced our floating balance by nearly $800 million year-to-date, now representing slightly over 20% of our debt structure. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to further manage this balance over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to have constructive discussions with potential investors as we assess strategic options for our India business. We remain focused on executing an outcome that maximizes value and optimizes our global portfolio mix and the risk-adjusted return profile for American Tower and its stakeholders. As we move forward, we will keep our investors informed of any new developments. With that, please turn to slide 6, and I\u2019ll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you could see, Q1 consolidated property revenue growth was over 4% and approximately 7% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 4%, international growth of over 3% or nearly 9%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and approximately 10% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter, we benefited from accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, totaling approximately $39 million, partially offset by Vodafone Idea or VIL, revenue reserves of approximately $33 million, representing a modest improvement to payment trends as compared to the second half of 2022. Moving to the right side of the slide, organic tenant billings growth was a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth, standing at 6.4% on a consolidated basis, which as I mentioned, was our highest quarter since Q3 of 2017. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6% and nearly 7% absent Sprint-related churn, including a record quarter of colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million, a nearly 65% increase as compared to the growth reported in Q1 of 2022. Growth modestly exceeded our expectations, driven by some delays in churn, which we still anticipate to occur in the year and, to a lesser extent, new business upside. Similarly, our international operations experienced improvements across nearly all reported segments, generating organic tenant billings growth of 7.5% and over 180 basis-point acceleration from Q4 of 2022, which includes the benefits of CPI-linked escalator commencements across various contracts. Africa generated its highest quarter on record with organic tenant billings growth of 12.1%, including escalator contributions of over 10% and a continuation of solid new business of nearly 7%. Growth in the quarter benefited from some delays in previously communicated carrier consolidation-driven churn, which we still expect to occur in the year. Turning to Europe, we saw a growth of 8.2% and including over 6% from escalations, demonstrating our ability to monetize on CPI-linked escalators across the vast majority of our portfolio in the region. In Latin America, we saw a growth of 6.1%, which includes relatively consistent escalator and new business growth, partially offset by the continued elevated churn, as we\u2019ve highlighted on past calls. Churn in the quarter was favorable relative to our initial expectations as the decommissioning events have been slightly delayed to later in the year. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, we saw a growth of 3.4%, demonstrating steady improvement over the past three quarters. This growth acceleration was mainly driven by colocation and amendment contributions as carriers ramp up 5G deployments. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of over 1,300 sites in the quarter, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of exceeding 1,000 sites, primarily in Africa and Asia Pacific, as carriers continue to invest in their network coverage and densification needs across the regions. Initial returns remained solidly in the double digits with Q1 constructed sites yielding nearly 14% on day one. Turning to slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 9% to approximately $1.8 billion or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrated an approximately 270 basis-point improvement year-over-year to 63.7% and still an over 190 basis-point improvement when normalizing both periods of VIL-related revenue and bad debt reserves in India. This margin expansion was achieved through our continued focus on cost controls, allowing for approximately 100% conversion of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth. Again, on a normalized VIL basis and driving cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7.1% for the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO growth was 1.5%, while roughly flat on a per share basis, which includes financing cost headwinds of around 7.5% and 9.5% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, primarily driven by the rise in rates over the past year. Let\u2019s now turn to our revised full year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we had a strong first quarter, outperforming our initial expectations across the majority of our key metrics. While we are excited about the results to date and the sustainable demand trends that underpinned our performance, we have largely kept core and full year assumptions consistent to our prior guide, given our early position in the year and some of the timing benefits I alluded to earlier. This approach for our Q1 guidance is relatively consistent to past years. This also includes our assumptions around VIL-related revenue reserves, which we\u2019ve held at $75 million for the year. As noted earlier, we did record approximately $33 million in VIL reserves in Q1 with the guide applying an improvement for the duration of the year, notably in the back half. This assumption is supported by certain factors that we\u2019ve considered in our risk assessment, including the customers\u2019 contractual obligations for 2023, our latest conversations with VIL management, where they\u2019ve committed to meet these contractual obligations, and a demonstrated improvement in payments by the customer in Q1 relative to the second half of 2022. Key updates to our revised outlook include the impacts from the recent sale of the fiber business in Mexico, together with the upsides from FX derived using our standard methodology and several small adjustments below EBITDA at the attributable AFFO level. With that, let\u2019s dive into the numbers. Turning to slide 8. We are reducing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million versus our prior outlook, driven by $45 million related to the sale of the fiber business in Mexico, partially offset by $25 million associated with the positive impacts of FX. Moving to slide 9. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across our regions, and we\u2019ll continue to assess the positive momentum coming from our strong first quarter as we work further into the year. Moving on to slide 10. We are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook with a decline of approximately $25 million related to the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by $25 million from positive impacts of FX. Turning to slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $20 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.05 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.65 per share. Updates to our expectations, aside from FX, include the cash adjusted EBITDA reduction driven by the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by favorable net interest in part due to the use of the sale proceeds to pay down debt and some cash tax savings. On an isolated basis, the Mexico Fiber sale resulted in a $15 million decline to attributable AFFO as compared to our prior outlook midpoint. Moving on to slide 12. I\u2019ll review our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities for 2023. Beginning on the left side of the slide, our capital allocation priorities for 2023 remain consistent with our prior outlook, which includes approximately $3 billion towards our common dividend, subject to Board approval, representing 10% growth year-over-year on a per share basis. In addition, our CapEx outlook midpoints remain unchanged across all categories and support our initial plans to construct approximately 4,000 new sites across our international footprint. Moving to the right side of the slide. And as I highlighted earlier, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet in the first three months of the year, extending our average maturity profile to nearly six years, while reducing our floating rate debt balance to slightly over 20%. Additionally, we closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.2 times, well on track towards our deleveraging target of 3 to 5 times. Consistent with our past remarks, we remain focused on driving shareholder value through our growing dividend and accretive CapEx program while strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging, maximizing liquidity, managing a diverse pool of capital sources and an ongoing assessment of market conditions to potentially further term out floating rate debt and extend our maturity profile. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. Q1 was another strong quarter across our business with incremental steps taken towards strengthening our balance sheet. Underpinned by sustained demand trends across our global footprint, our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets generated accelerating leasing growth, while our capabilities as an operator and partner continue to afford us opportunities to deploy accretive capital to its high-yielding development projects. We believe we are well positioned to drive compelling growth, supported by attractive secular trends across our global footprint and deliver solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Brad, if I could just add a couple of points there. Thanks for the question. You see in our quarterly numbers here, we got our leverage down to 5.2% (sic) [5.2x]. And of course, as constant, we did use the proceeds from the fiber business to pay down debt, not just to delever, but to actually reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, which we did, and we\u2019re down around that 20% number. And that really shows our commitment to our investment-grade balance sheet in this environment, looking to delever. That\u2019s definitely top of the list when it comes to capital allocation once you get beyond paying the dividend and the dividend growth that we have. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on delevering the business until we get down within our target range of 3 to 5 times. And we\u2019re also continuing to focus on reducing our exposure to floating rate debt. So, we\u2019re within our policy now right at about 20%. But we\u2019re going to be looking at that and working to try to reduce that exposure on the floating rate side even more than that in the coming quarter. So, you\u2019ll see us pretty active in that space. One thing, Brett, that I\u2019ll just alert you to is don\u2019t be surprised if you see the 5 float back up a little bit, even maybe a 5.3 in the coming quarters before you see it trending back down. That will just be a function of kind of where our EBITDA -- our quarterly annualized EBITDA might end up landing. But that should not make you think that our commitment to delevering isn\u2019t as strong as we\u2019re suggesting it is, because it is, but you may see it flow back up just a touch before you see it come back down. Hey, Michael. Good morning. Thanks for joining, and thanks for the question. We\u2019ve talked about in the past we are seeing an acceleration in the leasing environment in the U.S. in terms of our numbers and specifically the incremental revenue that we\u2019re seeing from new business coming from colocations and amendment. So, we had a really strong quarter in Q1 in the U.S. We booked about $60 million of incremental colocation amendment revenue. That\u2019s well on track to achieve our $220 million target for the year, which is a nice step-up over last year, which was about $150 million. So, that\u2019s the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing. That is primarily coming from the primary carriers, the big three certainly. And DISH is also a contributor in that. And I think you know and most everyone on the call knows that we have holistic deals with the carriers in the U. S. environment. So not that we\u2019ll go through any specifics with how they work carrier by carrier, but what it does is it has our revenue contracted in there. So, we have about 90% of our revenue and revenue growth for this year fully contracted, and there\u2019s no variability in that. So, we feel really good about that. And then when you look at the long-term going out through 2027, you\u2019ve heard us talk about that 5% on average OTBG in the U.S. We have about 75% visibility out over that long period of time of the underlying revenue as colored for revenue growth. So we feel really good about that. But the vast majority of that activity is the big three plus DISH. Certainly, we have kind of this other category with some broadcasters, some local independent radio companies and other people that use our towers like government agencies. And they always contribute a piece there, and they\u2019re kind of in the range that they\u2019ve always been at. But the vast majority really is the big guys in the U.S. When you think about churn, we did have delays in churn, which helps support our growth rates for the quarter. So, we\u2019re up to about 6.4%. Our churn came in at about 3.4% for the quarter. And the places where it\u2019s noticeable, it\u2019s a slight improvement in the U.S. because of churn, but that\u2019s not the biggest piece. It\u2019s probably more dropping down into Latin America. Within our overall guide for Latin America, we had 8 percentage points in for churn. And that is primarily coming from two big carriers: Telefonica, which everyone knows what\u2019s happening with Telefonica in Mexico as well as Oi down in Brazil. Oi represents about 2% within that 8%. And what\u2019s happening is just the delay. So we fully expect the churn for the Telefonica churn as well as the Oi churn to kind of catch up here during the year. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing a change to our organic tenant billings outlook for the full year. So, we do expect to kind of catch up with that. So, we\u2019ll take the positive benefits for Q1, and we\u2019re still kind of being realistic and maybe a little conservative in terms of keeping our organic tenant billings growth consistent. But that\u2019s really where it is. We also have elevated churn in Africa with Cell C down in South Africa and even AirtelTigo over in Ghana. And again, we\u2019re not changing our full year outlook with just the timing is moving around just a bit. Let me hit the India process first, and then I\u2019ll jump into the next question. So, we are running a process, as Tom and I have talked about here on this call and in the prior call. It\u2019s very similar to the process we walked through when we sold an equity stake in our data center business in the U.S. as well as the European joint venture that we did. So, we\u2019ve gone out to the top couple dozen highly professional, large investors that are in the infrastructure space. Our goals remain the same that in the other transactions we did, really, which is to partner to or sell the equity to a very strong investor that understands the space that can help run the business, has government connection, has carrier connections, all those sorts of things. So bringing more than just capital, but also a willingness and some experience to be a strategic partner in the business. So that process continues. I would say at this point, it\u2019s progressing. And we\u2019ve got the list worked down from the full couple of dozen to a smaller list here, still very active. And I think we\u2019ll figure out where we head and what that transaction might look like in the coming quarter. So, there\u2019ll be more to update you on probably in the next call. But we\u2019ll be patient. We\u2019ll be opportunistic as we kind of work through it, and we\u2019ll see what the opportunities there look like. And when we decide what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019ll have the best interest of the shareholders in mind, of course, and as well as the employees and the customers there in India. But it\u2019s a very similar process that we\u2019ve kind of gone through before. I guess when you think about the -- jumping into the next question here in terms of AFFO. You know we have AFFO per share growth in our guide here that\u2019s a little less than zero, so a negative growth rate. And I\u2019ll just remind you that the headwinds there, as you highlighted, is really the financing interest cost, but also the issuance of the shares that we did middle of last year to help finance the CoreSite business as well as FX. So, we are seeing roughly an 8% headwind for the year around the financing pieces, including the spike in interest rates. We\u2019re seeing about a 1% headwind roughly on FX. And the VIL reserve that we\u2019re taking, that $75 million that we talked about, that represents about a 2% headwind as well. So, when you put all that together, the core underlying business is in fact growing in that 8% to 9% range this year. And we think that feels like a pretty good place for us. So to the extent that we drive 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S., we drive a little bit higher organic tenant billings growth in our international markets, we complement that with another 100 basis points or so with new builds. We expand margins as we drop down through the P&L. And then, we deployed capital in a prudent way. We certainly think that upper single-digit growth rate is achievable. Now with that said, there are a few things that could still be items that we need to watch. The VIL situation is a situation that\u2019s ongoing that we continue to -- the need to watch. We don\u2019t know exactly where interest rates will go. So, we\u2019re certainly being prudent in trying to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, get ahead of refinancings and reduce refinancing risk. And this year, we\u2019ve already issued just under $3 billion of new bonds, new notes. And that removes the refinancing risk from \u201823 entirely. Now, we\u2019re beginning to look at \u201824 to remove that. But you put all that together, as long as interest rates cooperate if that bag kind of hangs in there, which we\u2019re seeing favorability in the spot rates, so that\u2019s kind of trending in a good direction. If we sort out the VIL kind of India volatility, then upper single digits certainly is achievable in this business. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio of assets in a lot of really good places, and we\u2019ve got customers that are actively leasing the site. So, we feel really good about the core performance of this portfolio. Hey David, good morning. I\u2019ll take the first one on Voda. So the collections rate that we\u2019re seeing in Q1, it\u2019s not better than our expectation. It\u2019s right in line with our expectation. We expect the level of collection that we had in Q1 to continue into Q2 as kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it. I\u2019m not sure if I heard all the detail in your question, but I\u2019ll try to clarify for you. That collections rate that we experienced in Q1 is slightly better than what we experienced in Q4 of last year and what we experienced in Q3 of last year. So that\u2019s where we talk about the improvement in terms of the collections from Vodafone. It\u2019s really the first half of this year, let\u2019s say, compared to the last half of last year. The other part of your question, I think it kind of leads into what\u2019s happening later in the year. And we do expect an improvement in collections from Vodafone as we enter into the second half of this year. And so, that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re looking. And we talk to Voda quite frequently. We have -- you have seen -- we\u2019ve seen that the government converted their equity. That does kind of clear the way a little bit for Voda to work on their balance sheet and to potentially raise equity and debt. And we gather that they\u2019re working aggressively on that. You may have seen a new Board appointment over in India. We think that\u2019s a really good fact as well. And we do believe that Voda management is committed to and capable of increasing their payments to us in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s reflected in our outlook. So that\u2019s kind of how those bits and pieces worth most of the $75 million serve that we have in there will be booked and realized in the first half of this year. Hey Batya, good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding M&A, our view today is consistent with where it\u2019s been in the last couple of -- the last few months, certainly the last couple of quarters, which is in this environment, given what\u2019s available and kind of the differences that we see in pricing between private tower sales and, let\u2019s say, public tower equities, along with some terms and conditions that, of course, are important, when you look at portfolio by portfolio and region by region, we continue to look at the pipeline. And in our evaluation, there\u2019s nothing in there that we see that\u2019s compelling at the moment. Nothing in there that we see that would require us or prompt us to make any kind of a move. So then we settle back in. And we\u2019re firmly kind of committed to our capital allocation approach here going forward. And one of the things that helps guide us is the uncertainty around rates and ensuring that we\u2019re reducing our leverage getting back below our 5 times in a prudent amount of time, also reducing that floating rate exposure, making sure we\u2019re aggressively managing interest rates along with providing a dividend and a growing dividend to our shareholders. So, when you look at the totality of opportunities available, we\u2019re fully committed to the dividend and dividend growth. Next, we allocate capital to our capital programs, our internal programs where we build towers. We\u2019ll build around 4,000 this year around the globe. Those come in at very high day one NOI yields, roughly mid-teens. 14% is the number for the -- for Q1. So, we feel that that\u2019s really good. We\u2019re also allocating some capital within our capital number for this year towards CoreSite in the mid-$300 million, let\u2019s call it, $360 million or so. And as we\u2019ve discussed, that\u2019s kind of within their cash flow generation. They produce EBITDA or gross margin, let\u2019s say, in the mid-400s. So we\u2019re comfortably kind of reinvesting -- their cash flow back into their business to make sure that we have capacity to continue to satisfy the customers and keep up with the record demand that we experienced last year in the first quarter of this year. And I\u2019ll highlight again for the folks on the call here that our capital program this year is slightly below last year, not materially below, but they\u2019re slightly below. And that\u2019s kind of a function of allocating capital towards balance sheet and reducing leverage and reducing our floating rate exposure. When you think about Europe and Asia, like we would want to be larger in there. We think that market is very constructive for us. We do think there are some interesting portfolios there, but nothing that we\u2019ve seen yet in terms of terms and conditions and pricing and all the different pieces lining up where it would need to be. And we don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. But over the next several years, let\u2019s call it, 2 to 5 years, Europe is a place where we could be active in looking at different portfolios. We think there\u2019s really good backdrop in Europe. With that said, if we don\u2019t buy anything in Europe, we\u2019ve got a really good portfolio and feel good about our position day one. And when you think of Asia where we spent a lot of time in the last couple of years looking at different transactions in Asia, and again, nothing kind of lined up and met our criteria. We\u2019re very-disciplined when it comes to pricing terms and conditions, counterparty and also country evaluations and things like that. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined. And I do think you\u2019ll see us be very committed to balance sheet, reducing leverage, reducing floating rate debt and not active in any major way in M&A in the near term. And then, maybe in Europe, the other thing just to hit your other question, we\u2019re seeing good activity across Europe. It\u2019s a -- when you think about Germany, kind of the center point that Drillisch 1&1 is just beginning to ramp up their network build in a full greenfield 5G build. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of revenue activity from that. But we\u2019re excited to support them in their endeavor to build out a network there. And we do think that we\u2019ll see more activity with them in the second half of this year and certainly in years to come. But then when you think about France and Germany and Spain across the board, we think there\u2019s a really good backdrop, a good set of counter-parties and carriers there for us to support. And we feel really good about the growth rates and our position within those markets. We guided when we did the Telxius transaction that we would be achieving mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth. We\u2019ve been above that since we acquired the portfolio in this year, we\u2019re again looking at upper single digits in that 7% to 8% range, which is a really nice place. We\u2019re benefited from the activity that we\u2019re seeing from the carriers in terms of the leasing. We\u2019re also benefited from the contract terms where we have untapped escalators in Germany and in Spain, which is very helpful. And then we\u2019re seeing very low churn rates again, because of the demand that we see from the carriers to build out networks and also the way the contracts work that we\u2019ve been able to negotiate. So, we feel really good about our position in Europe. We feel really good about our ability to support the carriers\u2019 endeavors to build out networks in Europe, and we think there are some good things to come in Europe. So, you are correct in terms of the organic new bid, the incremental new bids we get from colocations and amendments. That $60 million number, we do see that at the peak for the year. But with that said, it will be -- we expect that number on a quarterly basis to be between $50 million and $60 million for the next three quarters for the full year. So, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re going to see a big drop off. It is pretty linear there the way things work. So -- but you will see it drift down a little bit, and that is kind of a function of the timing of the MLAs and the use right fees. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail about the contracts and the way the contracts work. But you can have timing differences here where you have use right fees that step up in a certain quarter. They\u2019re mostly front-end loaded. And then you also have the ability to get additional revenue over and above that, which can be more variable kind of throughout the quarter. I would say that that -- the $220 million that we\u2019re seeing this year, there is kind of a function there with the MLAs and kind of some of the transition period that we had kind of moving in and out of different MLAs, that does help support that number a bit. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that number is a little bit lower next year. But with that said, we\u2019re still seeing kind of the acceleration of that revenue kind of as we enter the beginning of this year. And again, it will taper off on a quarterly basis. But we\u2019ll hit the $220 million for the full year. That again is up almost 50% from the $150 million that we that we hit last year. And we continue to feel really good about everything that we see and work on in terms of the U.S. business being in a strong position to achieve 5% organic tenant billings growth on average out over the time period through 2027. So, we\u2019re very excited about the data center business that we have. I think you\u2019ve heard us say in the past that it\u2019s a differentiated set of assets to the extent that it\u2019s a cloud-rich standard facilities, multiple cloud on-ramps and lots of the facilities that we have, their network and lots of enterprise customers in there. And that really means there\u2019s a lot of interconnection. People come into these facilities for those multiple cloud on-ramps and to interconnect with everyone else, the cloud, the networking companies and the other enterprise companies. That is helping drive this record growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, as we\u2019ve talked about, we saw record new bids for CoreSite through the full year 2022. And we also saw a continuation of that where we had a record new business performance for Q1 kind of quarter-over-quarter from prior year, I should say, from Q1 of last year. So that strong performance certainly is continuing. That resulted in a 10% revenue growth year-on-year for that business. That\u2019s higher than what we underwrote that business for. We\u2019ve talked about kind of upper single-digit 6% to 8% economic growth in that set of assets. That\u2019s the way we underwrote it. And we outperformed last year. We\u2019ve got a really good start this year. Maybe that 10% thinks back a little bit. But we should be solidly in the upper single-digit growth rate and within our underwriting targets for that business. We\u2019re also seeing really strong growth in interconnection revenue, up about 9.5%. And that\u2019s really key because that really represents what these customers are doing within our facilities and why they\u2019re there. And it makes the revenue that we have a lot more durable, dependable and sticky because they\u2019ve got these relationships with other enterprise customers and into all these networking companies. So, that is a really good fact. We\u2019re also increasing prices within that market being sensitive to customers as well, but also trying to drive growth in that business and making sure we\u2019re getting the value that these assets are contributing to our customers. So, we continue to see cash mark-to-market increases in the 3% to 5% range, 3% to 4% range, which is -- which is going well. We have escalators in lots of our contracts, so we generally see a 3% escalator kind of in our underlying contracts. The churn rate continues to be in the mid-single digits in that business, in the 6.5% range, well within our 6% to 8% target. And our maintenance CapEx is right within our target range of about 2% of revenue, runs in between $20 million and $30 million a year. So, we\u2019re really pleased with the way that the team is running that business and the way those assets are performing for us. And quite frankly, what those assets do for our customers, which they\u2019re really important assets for the customers. And we\u2019re continuing at a gross margin that\u2019s almost 60%. So, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with the performance of the data center business and the future outlook, quite frankly, and the optionality that those assets provide us when you think about the edge and potentially connecting those assets into our towers and into edge compute facilities closer to our customers\u2019 base radios on the wireless side, but also closer to network companies as well as enterprise customers that are scattered throughout the U.S. So, that business and the future outlook there is really strong."

            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As is customary for our first quarter call, my comments today will focus on our U.S. business, which is principally comprised of our tower and data center platforms, which made up 55% of our consolidated property revenue and 64% of our property operating profit in the first quarter of 2023. With regard to our tower platform, the secular tailwinds that have supported outstanding growth over the last two decades remain consistent. Every year, U.S. wireless subscribers consume more mobile data through a growing number of devices and applications, requiring faster speeds and lower latency performance. As a result of the increasing levels of data being consumed, our customers are deploying more equipment on our towers to meet that demand. In addition, and more than ever before, our customers are utilizing multiple bands of spectrum to deliver those high-quality, ubiquitous levels of service. In 2022, U.S. carriers deployed around $40 billion in network capital to provide nationwide 5G services on mid-band spectrum. This record level of activity is reflective of the first major wave of the typical investment cycles we\u2019ve seen over the last 20 years, during which carriers amend existing sites to provide initial coverage and capacity with the new technology and harvest benefits from core network enhancements and spectral efficiencies. In previous cycles, these initial peaks have typically been followed by periods of moderation in overall spending, driven in part by reductions in spend on core upgrades, fiber and other infrastructure assets. However, we\u2019ve historically seen tower spend remain in focus as our customers look to support continuous growth in mobile data consumption and provide market-leading network quality and reliability. And we would expect more of the same over the 5G cycle. In 2023, while we\u2019re still in the relatively early stages of the overall 5G rollout, we continue to see customers making significant investments into their networks as part of their broader coverage initiatives, having yet to invest in densification at scale. These investments into adding and modifying equipment on our sites, which we\u2019ve monetized to our MLAs, is driving 5.6% organic growth in Q1 or nearly 7%, absent the impacts of the Sprint churn, our strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020. And for the full year, we expect $220 million in year-over-year growth contributions from colocations and amendments, a record for our U.S. business. Looking out over the next several years, we see an environment that is supportive of continued strong performance in the U.S. as the 5G investment cycle progresses and densification occurs. In American Tower, we\u2019ve underwritten this expectation into the comprehensive MLAs that underpin our expectation to deliver average annual organic growth of at least 5% or 6% excluding the Sprint churn over the next 5 years, which closely mirrors the 6.2% average organic growth we experienced between 2016 and 2020. Further, industry estimates suggest total monthly mobile data consumption that will require increased speed and lower latency is set to grow at a compounded annual rate of above 20% over the next five years, which we expect to be driven by continuous increases in mobile network utility, irrespective of potential impacts from any one category of new applications. As a result, we believe our customers\u2019 networks will need to provide at least 2 times the network capacity they have today in 3 to 4 years or roughly 3 times today\u2019s capacity as we approach the end of the decade. Over time, we expect our customers to meet this demand through continued network upgrade and densification initiatives, spectrum refarming and the deployment of 5G on new spectrum. In this context, we believe our portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to serve our customers across the balance of the 5G cycle with significant capacity to accommodate additional equipment and new tenancies even beyond what\u2019s been contractually locked in today. As we\u2019ve done historically, we anticipate leveraging our best-in-class internal processes to generate incremental efficiency in the business and higher levels of service for our customers with both resulting in increasing conversion of our top line growth to AFFO. Through a combination of organic growth and M&A, we\u2019ve added nearly $2.4 billion in annual property revenues to our U.S. and Canada segment since 2014, paired with less than $60 million in incremental SG&A expense or roughly 2% of the corresponding revenue growth. This prudent approach to cost management and operational efficiency has helped to drive operating profit margin expansion in the segment by roughly 400 basis points over the period. Going forward, given the benefits of our established scale, demonstrated ability to maximize the operating leverage potential inherent to our model and concerted efforts to further drive cost efficiencies at every level of the organization, we see a tremendous opportunity for capacity utilization in our existing assets to drive high-margin growth and expanding returns on invested capital as the 5G landscape continues to mature. Now, with respect to our CoreSite U.S. data center platform, we are equally excited about the prospects for value creation. Increasingly complex digital business demands require enhanced infrastructure performance and flexibility. CoreSite serves as an optimal nexus for the cloud service providers, service integrators, networks and enterprise customers inter-operate to propel their business initiatives forward. We continue to see customers landing and expanding with CoreSite because it provides native access to key cloud service platforms and a diverse ecosystem, which allows them to serve their customers in a way that is flexible, scalable and it drives growth and efficiency in their businesses. This is reflected in the continued strength of CoreSite\u2019s leasing results interconnection growth driven by both existing customers and new logos, as well as the ability to drive pricing, solid renewal rates and generate industry-leading returns. We also recognize that we\u2019re still in the early stages of a broader digital transformation movement. Each year, data center workloads and compute instances continue to grow at a rate of approximately 12% in the vast majority of all new IT architectures deployed into cloud and hybrid environments that CoreSite is uniquely positioned to support. Additionally, we continue to expect to generate long-term growth from enterprise digital transformations and IT hybridization as organizations face workload management challenges that require the operational -- optionality, agility and critical interconnection capabilities that our CoreSite data center platform offers. Importantly, the absorption of this type of demand drives incremental value to our interconnection ecosystem and further builds on the momentum behind the CoreSite flywheel and the value we can provide our customers. So, we see a long tail of opportunity to continue growing and scaling our campuses, and we have the added benefit of being able to prudently select opportunities that are accretive to our ecosystem. As a result, we\u2019ll continue to invest cash flows generated in the data center segment back into the business, provide our customers incremental confidence in a long runway for growth with CoreSite and generate highly attractive returns. Meanwhile, our teams continue working to develop solutions that leverage our combined communications real estate platforms to position American Tower as a leading infrastructure provider for the networks of the future and create incremental value for our customers and shareholders alike. In summary, our foundational U.S. tower and data center platforms are set to deliver continued growth and strong returns. We believe that the long-term secular tailwinds, the differentiated high-quality nature of both our U.S. tower portfolio and our data center interconnection platform, the value proposition they represent for our customers and the seasoned high talented teams managing them uniquely positions American Tower to create significant incremental value for the industry and our shareholders for many years to come. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our Q1 results and expectations for the balance of the year. Rod? Yes. Hey Brett, I\u2019ll start, and Rod can also obviously add on here. We look at every one of our assets in our markets repeatedly. And continually, you\u2019re looking at where are the best rates of return that we can drive, are there better places for us to reallocate capital. And so, this is -- it\u2019s an ongoing process that we do internally. We also do it with our Board every year as well. And the business that we\u2019ve had in -- the fiber business that we\u2019ve had in Mexico, we\u2019ve had for several years, was really part of our kind of initial innovation and platform extension approach. And the piece of that particular business was just a business that we couldn\u2019t generate the kinds of returns on that we had expected. And we felt that it would be a better -- could be in better hands with somebody who had broader scale in the marketplace. And so, as a result of our kind of ongoing review, it was a business that we\u2019ve actively marketed over the last several months. And this is consistent with how we\u2019re thinking about even a market like India, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. It goes through that same kind of disciplined approach that we have. And we look at, okay, in each given market, again, like India, is there a better place to be able to reallocate some of that capital or invest in other products and services. And so, that\u2019s the process that we\u2019re going through right now. And Rod and I talked about it on the last call with you all. And we\u2019ll look to, as we did with the fiber, I mean, our goal from a balance sheet perspective is to delever, as we\u2019ve talked about right now, and we use those proceeds from the fiber sale to do just that. And we will continue to look at kind of delevering the balance sheet really over the next 12 to 18 months until we get it to a spot that we\u2019re really comfortable with. Yes, absolutely, Brett. You\u2019re exactly right. And now whether we go back down to 3 times, it could be a bit of a stretch. But clearly, we want to get sub-5. And as Rod said, we really do want to lessen the exposure to the floating rate debt that we have on the balance sheet. Yes, sure. Let me start, and then Rod, you can continue -- or can add to it. To continue -- continuation of what we saw in 2022. I mean, the demand from -- for the kind of the digital infrastructure that we have just continues to be strong throughout the country. And it\u2019s a really nice balance between enterprise accounts, between operators as well as the cloud. So, the pipeline remains really healthy, and we\u2019ve been able and have taken advantage of the opportunity to capture some strong pricing actions throughout the year, particularly as we really continue to drive all the interconnection growth. So, we\u2019re really pleased with what the team has done, with the types of business that they\u2019ve generated, and it really resulted again in a really strong Q1, and we continue to have really strong expectations for the business going forward. With regards to kind of all of the edge work, we continue to work internally on identifying particular locations where we can actually drive 1 meg or 2 meg of power. We have a number of sites that are shovel-ready at this point, and we\u2019re looking to move on them. We continue to have conversations with all the service operators as well as the hyperscalers and all the cloud players to continue to move forward and figure out that value proposition that we think can be a profitable one for all of us. And so, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s still early stages of it, but we continue to remain really excited about the ultimate opportunity. From a design and engineering perspective, we really have the specs really well laid out such that, as I said before, we\u2019re shovel-ready on a couple of locations to start to deploy it. And so, the teams know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like, have identified who the vendors are that are going to be providing a lot of the resources and pieces of it. And so, we\u2019re really far along on the overall design. I don\u2019t know that I want to get into -- at this point in time. When we\u2019re ready to roll it and deploy it, we can give more -- we\u2019ll give more specifics as to the overall economics. Rick, it\u2019s consistent with some of the experiences candidly that we\u2019ve had in the past in the business, and we thought we might be able to do things differently and unique. That particular asset came with at tens of thousands of sites in Mexico City, which was also very interesting to it and remains very interesting to us, and we still have the right to those particular assets as our customers deploy and densify in Region IX or in Mexico City itself. But what we continue to learn on the retail side, just how difficult it is to be able to provision circuits and make money, providing lit services to enterprise accounts and then just how competitive it is. And the SLAs that go along with them, how difficult it is to be able to maintain them in a very profitable manner. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of competition in the marketplace. And so, as a result, it just makes sense for us to put those particular capabilities in the hands of somebody that just does that 24/7. And hopefully, they will find more success there. But it\u2019s consistent with what we see in the fiber business in all of our markets, including the U.S., where we think that there\u2019s really an opportunity for fiber is when you\u2019re bringing it to the tower. That\u2019s kind of a slam dunk for us because that\u2019s obviously improving the capability and the capacity of a particular site. So, when we start to get into the retail aspects of it, it\u2019s just such a competitive, capital intensive, low margin opportunity that it just made sense for us to move out of it. Yes. I mean, Rick, it still is in that kind of that 50% range. Some are a bit higher, some are a bit lower. But in the aggregate, it\u2019s at that 50% range I think that have been touched. Again, it\u2019s largely been coverage. There are some pockets of densification going on, still largely amendment-driven, if you will, in terms of getting that ubiquitous coverage on a nationwide basis. So the carriers all remain active. And as Rod mentioned, the overall capital spend, we expect it to be lower in \u201823 versus \u201822. But as you well know, our comprehensive MLAs really protect us from that type of volatility, if you will. And so, while the carriers may spend at different levels on a consolidated basis, slowed down a bit as would be expected in \u201823, we really are protected from that. On the private side, yes, there is a lot more dialogue going on candidly relative to private networks. I mean I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a surge of deployments. But I do see our sales teams entering into different types of conversations with carriers, enterprises, looking at deploying kind of private 5G types of networks. We have some that we\u2019re experimenting with and deploying. I think there\u2019s more to come on that. But clearly, 5G, I think, plays -- will play a significant role in developing that aspect of the market. Dave, with regards to DISH, they remain very active in the market. They are investing throughout the country to meet all of their FCC requirements. They\u2019re -- have always been a good partner. I have a lot of faith in their leadership team there in terms of being able to develop the network and drive strategies that make sense for them. So from our perspective, there has been a very strong player and a very strong partner. I\u2019m not going to speculate on bankruptcies and all the other types of things candidly. But just to let you know that I believe that they are really strong leadership team, really smart and being, I think, very intelligent in terms of how they\u2019re building out their network. I mean we\u2019ve been working with DISH for a number of years in terms of helping them look at the engineering of their network and building out their network. And I would say that our U.S. leadership team has had, I think, a really strong relationship with them right out of the gate. I can\u2019t speculate on other types of relationships with some of the other tower cos. But we\u2019ve been really comfortable with the relationship and how it\u2019s been built over the years. And I think that there\u2019s a mutual respect for -- between both entities."

Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time-to-time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Vondran: Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in our Q3 results, demand remains strong across our global portfolio of real-estate assets. In our Tower business, our customers' efforts to deploy mid-band 5G for additional coverage continue to support a healthy pipeline of activity across the US, Europe and parts of our emerging markets. The discussions we're having with our carrier customers about their need to address upcoming capacity requirements, particularly in the US, further reinforce our bullish expectations for the densification phase of the 5G investment cycle. Additionally, our data center segment delivered another fantastic quarter of leasing, benefiting from accelerating hybrid IT deployments and early signs of AI-related demand. To complement our top line growth, we're executing our previously stated strategic initiative to enhance our portfolio composition and improve the quality of earnings by focusing our discretionary capital in developed markets and closing our India sale. I want to thank all the teams involved in the sale process for their efforts and dedication to getting the deal over the finish line and for ensuring a successful outcome for both American Tower and Brookfield. Finally, we continue to add value by managing our cost structure to maximize conversion rates, expand our margins and drive profitability across our business. We remain committed to executing on all these strategic priorities that position American Tower to deliver durable, high quality earnings growth over the long term. On our last call, I talked through the key lessons learned from our historical capital investments that have led us to refine our approach to investment underwriting and prioritize capital deployment to our developed markets. Having recently covered the US tower market where demand remains firmly intact, I'll focus today's remarks on our other developed market platforms, Europe and CoreSite. However, I'd first like to recognize the critical efforts of our US teams who have been working with our customers to rapidly restore essential communication and emergency services to those communities affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I really appreciate all their hard work. So now I'd like to highlight trends in our European and CoreSite businesses, which are each positioned to capture high rates of organic growth and provide opportunities to further invest where returns meet our standards. I'll start with Europe. As we've highlighted on past calls, we were highly disciplined in our approach to inter-select European markets at scale, and we're seeing that patience pay off. In our assessment of Europe, we leveraged our global underwriting and operating experience to effectively evaluate the most attractive markets. Our criteria included macroeconomic stability, government support for mobile connectivity, healthy carrier and counterparty profiles and critical contract terms and conditions. Additionally, we sought market and competitive dynamics where we believe that our value proposition as a true independent operator with over two decades of global experience could successfully deliver a best-in-class customer experience that affords outsized new business and enhanced margins. This rigorous assessment led to the acquisition of select portfolios across Germany, France and Spain, where mobile data consumption is expected to grow at about a 20% CAGR over the next five years and where governments have advocated for nationwide coverage through various activities, including spectrum auctions and subsidy programs like the new deal in France, Spain's 5G UNICO to support rural 5G development and the Gigabit Infrastructure Act at the broader EU level. Importantly, these markets also present a healthy carrier environment, including increased competition in Germany and Spain through new entrants as well as strong market leaders with whom we contract for the majority of our business. Approximately 85% of our revenues in Europe are indexed to carriers with at least a 25% share in their respective markets. This provides a high degree of insulation from further consolidation risk, maintaining our very low exposure to ongoing consolidation in Spain, while providing visibility into sustained growth and quality earnings over the long term. And although land sharing is a reality in certain parts of these markets, we mitigate its impact with well-structured customer agreements that allow us to either monetize such sharing or provide certain revenue protections that support our growth objectives. American Tower is uniquely positioned to unlock opportunities in Germany, France and Spain where the neutral host independent tower model is still relatively nascent. Leveraging our considerable experience and capabilities can help solve persistent operational challenges experienced by the carriers and infrastructure operators throughout past network cycles. Since closing the Telxius acquisition, which increased our asset count in the region over five times, we further enhanced our ability to serve our customers by internalizing critical activities that align with our global competencies, reducing reliance on external vendors, strengthening our process management leadership and when possible, integrating our teams directly with our customers to expedite decision making and improved processes. Our disciplined approach to market entry and effective operational execution have yielded an attractive growth profile in Europe. On the organic side, healthy carrier demand combined with the benefit of CPI linked escalators have yielded an average of over 7% organic tenant billings growth over the past three years and we remain confident in driving organic growth, in line with our mid-single-digit expectations in the region going forward. To complement this organic growth, we also invested in increased newbuild activity, delivering 1,200 new sites since the start of 2021. Additionally, we've improved the process of getting new colocations on air to further evolve the neutral host model and reduce the carrier's total cost of ownership. This required engagement with regulators, landlords, tenants, vendors and the enhancement of our own internal skill sets that's paying off as approximately 70% of our expected organic new business growth in 2024 is coming through colocations, of which over a quarter are on rooftops. Taken altogether, we see a long runway of sustained growth with optionality to further capitalize on a multi-year pipeline of attractive development opportunities. As carriers continue to rapidly deploy mid-band spectrum and densify their networks to meet insatiable data demand, we'll continue to assess opportunities using both the principles that shaped our investments for over a decade and the recent learnings we've institutionalized. Now, I'll switch to our data center business. We also see long-term demand trends within our US data center segment, which like our European portfolio, provides a platform for incremental development opportunities underwritten at very attractive return profiles. Since closing the CoreSite transaction at the end of 2021, we've achieved record-breaking leasing each year and are on pace again to deliver a new high mark in 2024. As we've highlighted on past calls, our portfolio is optimally positioned to benefit from accelerating demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture due to its ability to facilitate seamless, secure, nationwide low-latency interoperability, including native cloud access to a diverse set of customers. Critically, we believe that CoreSite's interconnection campus model, which can be extended to distributed endpoints to support the low-latency and cost-efficiency required for future use cases, represents a potentially distinct option for new synergistic revenue opportunities when combined with our tower assets at the edge. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that the mobile edge is going to present a meaningful addressable market for us, in part due to the rapid acceleration in AI deployments and the infrastructure required to accommodate future latency-sensitive workloads like inferencing. And while the timing might be delayed relative to our initial expectations, we continue to expect synergies between our Tower and CoreSite platforms over the long -term. In the meantime, we're realizing the benefits of the step-function of AI demand and our leasing results at CoreSite. AI-driven workloads are a growing component of CoreSite's signed leasing and customer requirements are indicating that demand will only grow over the near-to-medium term. Over the past several quarters, enterprises have started to build their own GPU space architectures connecting to the cloud either through auto-ramps or our virtual OCX offering. These deployments resemble typical hybrid IT architecture, but they're larger and more power-dense. As with virtually all workloads across the AI spectrum, our facilities are well-equipped to accommodate this need. More indirectly, our data center portfolio is also benefiting from hyperscale AI absorption that's consuming a record level of capacity throughout our key markets, exacerbating the supply-and-demand imbalance and further supporting the favorable pricing environment for both new leasing and renewals into the foreseeable future. Given the healthy demand catalyst that we see persisting for many years to come, attractive rates of return that are de-risked through accelerated preleasing activity, we plan to allocate more capital to CoreSite over the next several years, likely meeting or exceeding the $480 million in development spend assumed at the midpoint of our 2024 guide. Recently, I've received questions as to whether we'd be interested in participating in the extensive hyperscale development taking place in the market today. We see a long runway ahead for CoreSite's retail-oriented approach, which has yielded industry-leading returns on a sustained basis as our facilities continue to meet and in certain cases exceed our initial expectations for mid-teen stabilized yields. Thus single-tenant hyperscale opportunities are not a priority unless there was a clear opportunity for one to serve as a seed for a new campus or if there were compelling opportunities to invest with our JV partner, Stonepeak. Today, we're prioritizing the expansion of existing campuses, new ground-up facilities adjacent to existing campuses or potentially selected expansion of our national ecosystem by establishing new campuses and new markets. We remain focused on developing multi-tenant colocation facilities, methodically curating the mix of customers deployed within our facilities to enhance the value of our interconnection ecosystem and effectively planning for long-term absorption and power needs. In closing, American Tower has built a global platform of assets that are well-positioned to capitalize on the exponential rise in data demand. Our CoreSite data center business and European tower operation are both differentiated by asset quality and best-in-class operations, creating a leading experience for our customers as they deploy the critical networks and applications of today and the future. These businesses are uniquely positioned to deliver attractive sustained organic growth and provide optionality for us to assess future opportunities for investment. This portfolio strength, combined with demand catalysts across our global portfolio and the ongoing progress we're making in executing the strategic priorities I laid out earlier in this year, position American Tower extremely well to deliver high-quality earnings growth and total shareholder returns for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q3 performance and our updated outlook. Rod?\nRod Smith: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in this morning's press release, adjusted for certain non-cash items in the quarter, including the loss taken upon closing our ATC India sale, our solid third quarter results continue to highlight strong demand across our exceptional portfolio of global assets. These durable demand trends, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, continued focus on cost management and strong balance sheet, position us to deliver sustained high-quality earnings, growth and shareholder returns over the long term. Before I dive into our results, I want to highlight a key reporting change as it relates to the successful closing of our ATC India sale on September 12th. You will now see historical results associated with our India business reported as discontinued operations, represented as a standalone line item on the income statement, balance sheet, and in our reconciliations to attributable AFFO. As such, certain reported measures, including revenues and expenses within the income statement and non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA and tenant billings, will now be presented to exclude discontinued operations. I encourage you to refer to the definitions and footnotes throughout our Q3 earnings presentation and press release for added clarity on how the discontinued operations treatment is reflected in our results. Additionally, we have introduced new metrics, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders or attributable AFFO as adjusted, and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share or attributable AFFO per share as adjusted. These new metrics represent results from continuing operations adjusted for a full period of interest expense savings associated with the use of proceeds from the India sale. The intent of these as adjusted metrics is to provide investors with what we believe our continuing operations would produce an attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. We believe this will be useful in determining an appropriate baseline for future periods. Now, a few highlights from the quarter. First, in the third quarter, demand for our global portfolio of assets remained strong as we saw a continued acceleration in application volumes in the US, which nearly doubled those of the prior year period and similar growth in our services gross margin. Internationally, mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth was supported by another quarter of accelerating new business contributions in Europe and double-digit organic growth in Africa. International organic growth was complemented by selective new site construction, including the fourth consecutive quarter of over 100 sites in Europe and approximately 500 new sites overall. As Steve mentioned, demand in our US data center business remains exceptionally strong and well in excess of our initial underwriting as CoreSite is on track for its third consecutive record year of new leasing, supporting year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. Next, complementing the demand trends driving our top line results, we continue to execute strategic priorities laid out earlier this year. On the cost management side, third quarter SG&A, excluding bad debt declined nearly 2% year-over-year, supporting cash-adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 30 basis points as compared to the prior year period. We also made progress in optimizing our portfolio, closing our India sale and signing agreements to sell our land interests in Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, we further strengthened the balance sheet by using ATC India sale proceeds to reduce gross debt and we expect further reductions from efficient repatriation in the near term. Importantly, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-minus during the quarter, signaling our momentum in executing key financial and operating strategies to enhance our balance sheet strength, financial flexibility and portfolio quality. These achievements reinforce our commitment to actively assess our global portfolio to focus on platforms where we can drive high-quality earnings and earnings growth, outsized returns and compelling total shareholder value over the long-term. Finally, on the customer front, we took certain provisions in Colombia related to WOM, who filed for the equivalent of US bankruptcy earlier this year. Any outcome of the potential reorganization is uncertain and it would be premature to speculate, but we began recognizing revenue on a cash basis and reserved a portion of outstanding AR as bad debt. In the third quarter, this resulted in revenue reserves of $13 million, including $3 million in straight line and another $8 million recognized as bad debt expense. For context, WOM Columbia's gross revenue makes up approximately 1.5% and less than 0.5% of our total Latin America and consolidated property revenues respectively. Turning to third quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 6. Consolidated property revenue declined approximately 1% year-over-year and increased nearly 1% excluding non-cash straight-line revenue. Growth was negatively impacted by roughly 3% due to FX as well as by the non-recurrence of certain one-time benefits in the US in the prior year period and revenue reserves taken in the current period in Colombia. As I mentioned, performance was supported by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our US Data Center business. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was over 5%. In our US and Canada segment, growth was 5% or approximately 6% absent Sprint related churn. As we have previously indicated, we expect to see a step-down towards 4% growth in Q4 due to the commencement of the final tranche of Sprint churn, consistent with prior outlook assumptions. On the international side, growth was 5.7%, representing an enhancement of over 100 basis points compared to prior expectations through the exclusion of the India business. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA declined approximately 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the revenue drivers, I just discussed. Growth excluding non-cash straight-line was just over 2%, benefiting from disciplined cost management and a roughly 100% increase in our services gross margin associated with an increase in tower activity. Growth was negatively impacted approximately 3% by FX headwinds. Moving to the right side of the slide, AFFO attributable to American Tower common stockholders increased 2.6% year-over-year, driven by the high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to AFFO through the effective management of interest costs, maintenance CapEx and cash taxes, partially offset by the timing of our India sale. On an as adjusted per share basis, growth would have stood at nearly 3%. Now shifting to our revised full year outlook. I'll start with a few key updates. First, outlook has been adjusted for the close of our India transaction. As a result, historical India results will now be treated as discontinued operations and as such, our property revenue, organic tenant billings and adjusted EBITDA will exclude India contributions for the full year. Our reported AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders will include contributions from discontinued operations up to the date of closing. Prior year periods have been adjusted accordingly. Next, our core business and the drivers that underpin our performance remain solid. As a company, we're focused on executing on a strong pipeline of new business demand, driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the global business and effectively allocating our capital in a manner that supports sustained value creation. As you'll see, we're absorbing provisions in our outlook related to WOM, consisting of $21 million in incremental revenue reserves, including $3 million in straight-line and an additional $15 million in bad debt expense, which combined represent $36 million in downside to adjusted EBITDA and $33 million to AFFO relative to our prior outlook. However, we're more than offsetting that exposure through direct expense savings and an anticipated settlement with a customer in Brazil associated with the cancellation of future lease obligations, the latter contributing $35 million of upside. Lastly, our revised FX assumptions include an incremental headwind of $25 million, $20 million and $17 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders respectively. Turning to Slide 8, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue from continuing operations by approximately $15 million. This outperformance includes $15 million of core upside, primarily driven by our data center segment and the one-time customer settlement in Brazil, partially offset by WOM related reserves and an anticipated delay in certain non-run rate reimbursements in the US, which we now expect to receive in 2025. Non-core outperformance is driven by increases in pass through revenue and straight-line. Total outperformance was partially offset by FX. Moving to Slide 9. Organic tenant billings growth expectations for consolidated US and Canada, Africa, Europe and Latin America remain unchanged with trends and catalysts consistent with our prior assumptions. The removal of the lower-growth India business did increase our international expectation by roughly 100 basis points from the prior outlook to approximately 6% and provides a modest benefit to our consolidated company expectations, though not enough to move our expectation of approximately 5%. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by $5 million. This outperformance is driven by the revenue drivers I just mentioned, together with incremental operating expenses upside achieved through a combination of recurring savings from various strategic initiatives as well as certain non-recurring benefits, gross margin expectations for our US services business remain intact. Although certain anticipated project delays into 2025 will likely bring our revenue modestly below initial estimates. Partially offsetting the benefits to adjusted EBITDA, we've assumed $15 million of additional bad debt expense associated with WOM and another $20 million in FX unfavorability. Moving to Slide 11. Adjusting our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook midpoint of $10.60 to the timing of the India closing resulted in approximately $0.12 of dilution, leading to a midpoint of $10.48 per share. This is directionally consistent with the dilution expectations communicated on past calls. Relative to prior outlook, adjusted for the ATC India closing, our revised outlook reflects upside of $0.05, moving the midpoint to $10.53 per share. Improvements include approximately $0.05 in outperformance from our India business through the September 12th closing date and the 100% conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA upside from our continuing operations on a currency neutral basis, which is largely offset by the impacts of FX. On an as adjusted basis, the outlook midpoint remains consistent at $9.95 per share, reflecting the core outperformance in our continuing operations, offset by FX. Moving to Slide 12. Our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, except for the removal of $105 million of capital expenditures allocated to India in our prior outlook. Our planned dividend distribution remains at $6.48 per share with the expectation to resume growth in 2025, all subject to Board approval. In summary, at the start of the year, we laid out a compelling set of expectations for 2024, reflective of the strong durable data demand trends that continue to highlight the criticality of our real-estate assets. Our top line financial targets assumed accelerating demand in the US and Europe, ongoing growth through 5G coverage and 4G densification across our emerging markets and a continuation of near-record setting leasing in our data center segment. To capture that demand, we established a set of strategic priorities aimed to effectively support our customers needs and drive new business opportunities manage our costs and capital structure and optimize our portfolio through selective asset sales and refined capital allocation priorities to enhance margins and the quality of our earnings profile. Our accomplishments to date and expectations for the duration of the year reflect the successful execution across each of these priorities, we believe this momentum will position us for an even stronger future, enabling us to drive attractive high quality growth and shareholder value for years to come. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nSteve Vondran: Good morning, Rick.\nRic Prentiss: Hey, I have two areas of questions. One at the top line and one at the bottom line. Last year on the third-quarter call, you gave some color on new lease activity in North America, kind of saying, hey, we're going to split the goalpost, no guidance given at the time, but kind of directionally, we'll split the goalpost, we'll be above '22 level, but below '23 levels. As we look at the green shoots and the positive stuff you just went through on your presentation, directionally, how should we think about '25 new lease activity versus '24 in North America?\nSteve Vondran: Yes. I'll take that, Ric. It's still too early to give guidance for next year. There's still some moving pieces in it. But if you look at the, in particular, the US business, we are hearing a lot of good conversation from our customers about the beginnings of the densification phase. And that's right in line with what we thought was going to happen. And so if you think about next year, in terms of the leasing in the US, we still have this final tranche of Sprint churn that's hitting in October this year that will weigh on the US a bit. And so when you kind of couple that with the kind of leasing environment that we're seeing, what's contractually already committed growth under our comprehensive MLAs, which does tick down just a little bit next year, that's most likely you're going to see us kind of in that mid-4s range in terms of the US growth rate for next year. And that's consistent with our long-term guide of at least 5% from '23 to '27, because if you think about '26 and '27, at that point, we're through the spread churn. And so if you look at 2025 through that lens, we still have about 100 basis points of churn coming in from that final Sprint churn tranche. So if you normalize that out, that's kind of be the mid-5s for next year. So that's kind of the way to think about sizing it and exactly where in that mid-4s range we're going to be, we're not sure yet. We do have one customer that's not uncomprehensive. So there's some volume-driven things with that. We also are hearing some interest from customers in new colocations that would be outside of our comprehensive MLAs. We don't know if that's going to fall in the early part of '25 or the later part of '25 or '26. We're still trying to figure that out. There's a few moving pieces there but directionally, you can think about it kind of being in that mid-4s range.\nRod Smith: Hey, Ric. Maybe I would just add to that. In terms of 2024 levels of new business, we had provided you guys all a range of between $180 million and $190 million. And the way the year is shaping up, it's pretty consistent each quarter in terms of the amount of new biz that we loaded on. We expect that to be similar for Q4 as well, so pretty similar to the last three quarters which was all in and around a quarterly contribution of about mid-40s, $45 million or so. That would end up landing us at kind of the lower end of that range around $180 million and that's all kind of supportive of then transitioning into next year and hitting the numbers that Steve just talked about.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And then on the bottom line question, Slide 11 is helpful. Appreciate Slide 11 in the deck. Want to make sure I understand completely not a CPA discontinued ops accounting makes my head spin this morning I'd admit. The -- we have been thinking originally that India would be kind of about $0.08 a quarter, maybe $0.32 a year as far as an impact net-net-net. How should we think about going from $10.60 to $10.48 to the $9.95 is what I'll call AAA FFO adjusted attributable adjusted funds from operations. How should we think about stepping down from that $10.60 to $10.48 to the $9.95, which sounds like that should be our jump-off point to thinking how growth in '25 would look?\nRod Smith: Yeah. I think that's right, Ric. So fully appreciate that the numbers can be a little bit complicated with the addition of the sale of India and accounting for that under discontinued ops. I'll try to hit a couple of the highlights here. And certainly, for anyone on the call that wants to go through it in more granular detail, our Investor Relations group is here to walk you through all the detail. First, I'll take you from maybe the $10.60 going over the $10.53, which is kind of our AFFO numbers as reported, right? So the $10.60 -- $10.60 a share was the original outlook. We sold India at the beginning of the fourth quarter here. So that's out of our numbers for the fourth quarter. So that pulled out $0.12. That's just the elimination of the India contribution to AFFO per share for Q4, which they're no longer in there. So we stepped from $10.60 per share to $10.48. Then on an apples-to-apples basis, India outperformed by about $22 million. That was largely with cash tax refunds and a few other items. There's outperformance across cash-adjusted EBITDA of the $20 million we show. And then there's a little bit of FX headwind another $17 million going the other way, primarily in the Latin America countries. That bridges us over to the $4.930 billion, which is equal to $10.53. So that $10.53 still has India in there for the first three quarters. When you drop down to the $9.95, you're basically reducing that by $0.58, which is the combination of pulling out the India contributions to AFFO and also offsetting that with interest savings that we have by using the $2 billion proceeds and the cash we got out earlier than closing in the third -- second and third quarter, which we pulled out another almost $350 million. Using all those proceeds to pay down debt will reduce our interest costs. So the net of taking India contributions to AFFO out also combining that with the interest savings from using the proceeds to pay down debt is the $0.58 that gets you down to the $9.95. And then there is some timing issues in there and some outperformance in that number as well, basically the $22 million that I just talked about from India, the discontinued ops outperformance largely in terms of cash taxes. And that $9.95 is the best representation of our continuing operations AFFO per share for 2024. And that is a really good starting point to think about how the core business, the ongoing business will grow going forward. And as we said, we look forward to mid-single-digit growth rates kind of going forward and that holds true for 2025. So that would put us into next year on an apples-to-apples basis the $9.95. We think we can grow that into the $10.50 range for 2025 and that would be AFFO from continuing operations. And again, Ric, I appreciate that there's a lot of numbers in here and it may take a little bit of time going through with our Investor Relations team. But trust me, when you kind of look through it, it becomes much easier after you've had a few minutes to think about it. I know people on the phone have only gotten the press release earlier this morning and there's a lot to digest. But once you get through it, I think you'll understand it pretty clearly.\nRic Prentiss: Understood. Helpful. And bottom line for me that is attributable AFFO per share now that's kind of cleaned up. Is it really a mid-single-digit growing business? Can you get back to high single-digits? Kind of what kind of tailwinds, headwinds kind of would keep you in mid-single-digit versus high single-digits?\nRod Smith: Yeah. I think, Ric, certainly getting above mid-single-digits is absolutely possible. We are very happy with the portfolio that we have across the globe. We've been working very diligently to improve the quality of the earnings and selling the India business, removing that volatility from the business is a -- certainly a positive when you think of that. So the long-term growth algorithm still holds true just as we've talked in the past, certainly. We think that US business can grow in the mid-single digits, just like Steve walked through the long-term guide for US OTBG on average that 5%. We do think next year with that final tranche of the Sprint churn will be the low watermark and then it will spring back up in '26 and '27. And you think about that longer-term guide over that whole period, averaging 5%, we're still on track. We're still on track. So that the international business can grow faster than that certainly. We all know that CoreSite is outperforming our original expectations. We're hitting double-digit growth this quarter and will -- for Q3 and we expect double-digit growth here now going forward annually. And we've had two years of record new business in CoreSite and we're pretty well set to either tie that or maybe even set a new record in 2024. So CoreSite is going exceptionally well. We've been very focused on cost controls, expanding margins, managing cash taxes, watching the balance sheet and reducing exposure to floating-rate debt. You put all that together and yes, the portfolio is strong and it's getting stronger as the quality of earnings go up and we've gotten through this interest headwind. So when you think about the longer term, we can get beyond that mid-single-digit growth rate. The areas to watch FX, we still have 25% of our earnings coming from Latin America and Africa. So that there is something that we will watch. And where interest rates go there's always uncertainty there. So we will watch that as well.\nSteve Vondran: Yeah. And I would just add in, Ric, if you think about kind of our long-term growth algorithm, couple of components to watch out for there. The first is Latin America. Over time, we believe that will come back to high single-digit growth. But for the next few years, we are projecting low single-digit growth in there based on care consolidation churn that's primarily OI, but it's also some potential consolidation that we see kind of on the map. We're seeing some challenges with WOM and there may be a little bit more consolidation there. And that's why we think for the next few years, that's going to be a low single-digits. Once we get past that, that won't be a headwind for us. And we are past the US Sprint churn after the end of this year. So that will be a positive for us. And so the swing factors will really be on what's going to happen with FX over time. And while we have reduced our exposure to it, 25% of our attributable AFFO is still attributable to our emerging markets. So there is still some FX risk there. And just in the last few weeks, we've seen a negative trend in that, that's resulted in a little bit of degradation for next year, just in the past few weeks. And then the other piece is interest rate headwinds and I think it's anybody's guess as to what exactly happens with interest rates over the next few years. So those are the things we'll be watching. But that long-term algorithm of mid to high single-digits holds true even while absorbing some of those costs in there.\nRic Prentiss: Great. Appreciate all the color guys. Thanks.\nSteve Vondran: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for all that color, Rod. Just, Steve, on the CoreSite business, you've been flagging the record leasing, it's not a number you guys have disclosed. Could we have a conversation about what the leasing number is and what the historical context of what you're throwing up now is and what the book-to-bill situation looks like in terms of the available pipeline to make that double-digit revenue growth happen? And then the second question, if I could, Rod, just to follow up on this discussion. So this -- I think what Ric called it the AAA adjusted attributable AFFO. This is a number that you're going to report kind of on an ongoing basis and it will be the anchor for our conversation about the growth in 2025 on a quarterly basis. Is that fair? Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Yeah, David, we'll certainly talk about that metric for as long as it's applicable, which will be a little while until we lap this India sale. But while the India sale and the discontinued operations is in our base number or the comparable prior year numbers, we will let you know what it is.\nRod Smith: And when it comes to CoreSite, I don't think we've given a specific number in terms of what sales are, but you can think about it as a factor of what they were doing pre-acquisition. That build pipeline, just for reference, we've got about over 40 megawatts of construction ongoing today. It's about 60% pre-leased today and that's replacing the capacity we've sold. So the way to think about that is, their leasing today is significantly higher than the year before we bought them. And the majority of our $70 million backlog that we have today is commencing between now and kind of the first half of 2025 and the remainder is beyond that. So we haven't given a specific sale number. We are giving you guys the backlog and that's the way to think about that revenue growth. We feel very confident in a high single or double-digit, most likely double-digit growth rate for the next several years in terms of revenue commencing there. And that continued strength continues to feed that sales pipeline and we're expecting to have a healthy pipeline in 2025 as well. At this point, all those general dynamics we're seeing in the industry are just continue to accelerate and that is demand for hybrid. Hybrid cloud infrastructure by enterprises is our bread and butter. That's where you continue to see strength in it. And we're starting to see those enterprises now deploy GPUs, their own kind of AI based models and that again is kind of the perfect customer for CoreSite. So we're seeing our existing customers increasing the size of their installations and that's going to keep feeding that pipeline for years to come. So we feel like that growth rate is durable for the foreseeable future right now.\nSteve Vondran: Yeah. And, David, maybe I would just add, in terms of the relationship with the prior numbers, our backlog in that $70 million range, that's up from a number in the range of $40 million or so when we bought CoreSite in those first couple of years. So it's up 75% or so. And that's a similar level of increase that we're seeing in the new biz roughly.\nDavid Barden: Okay. Thank you for the color, both.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks so much. Good morning. And, Rod, you talked about the dividend policy. Perhaps you could just give us some context around how you're thinking about that. If you're growing the bottom line, call it, mid-single-digits, is that the right way to think about dividend growth from here and how that works into payout ratios and leverage and so forth? And just coming back to the CoreSite CapEx, I think you said it could be ahead of the $480 million. I know in the past when you bought this, you were kind of to some extent ring-fencing how much you would spend on CapEx. Can you sort of update that for us? I mean, would you be prepared to go to say $600 million or $700 million or what are the parameters you're thinking about how much money you do commit to data centers? Obviously, a great opportunity and you don't want to go hyperscale at this point, but does sound like you see opportunities to deploy capital at attractive levels, but love to understand how big that might go. Thanks.\nRod Smith: Yeah, sounds good, Simon. I'll take the dividend question and then Steve will talk to you about the CapEx for CoreSite. So with the dividend, as we talked about on the last call, we do look forward to resuming dividend growth as we get into 2025. I don't want to get into too much detail in terms of what that growth rate might be, but similar to the way we've discussed it in prior calls, the long-term view of the dividend growth rate is that it will closely mirror the average AFFO per share growth rate over time. So that's the way we think about it. So, if we are hitting a mid-single-digit AFFO per share growth rate on average over time, we would expect that the dividend growth rate on average over that same time period would roughly equal that same kind of a growth rate. That's the way to think about it. You can't really apply that to every individual year because there could be puts and takes. But over time, I think you kind of get the trajectory there. Now, of course, with dividend and dividend policy, every quarter we go to our Board and ask them to approve the dividend declaration and distribution, we would always do that. So everything I'm talking about here is subject to Board approval. But we do -- again, the portfolio that we have is strong. It's getting stronger with the quality of earnings increasing, the balance sheet becoming stronger. So achieving that mid-single-digit AFFO per share growth rate may be driving that up from there as we talked about with Ric's question, that all would kind of tie into our ability to grow the dividend. And if that dividend grows in line with AFFO per share, we do see the dividend payout as a percent of AFFO staying roughly where it is, which, call it, between 60 and mid-60s kind of in that range. That leaves us another $1.5 billion to $2 billion-ish to deploy into our CapEx programs around the globe or use it to buy back shares or we can allocate it to debt reductions if we wanted to, but it still leaves us with plenty of excess capital to run the business.\nSteve Vondran: And on the CapEx for CoreSite, we're not constraining the business. So the business has the opportunity to deploy as much capital as it wants. And so you could see that number grow kind of into that range that you're talking about. And I would also just reiterate that the beauty of how we've constructed our CoreSite entity with our private capital partners is, we have a lot of optionality in terms of how we fund that additional capital growth. So we'll be able to make the determination how much American Tower wants to put in versus how much we rely on our partners kind of real-time as we're looking at the budgets for next year. So it's too early to tell you what the budget is going to be and what percentage we're going to pay. But it's a very good use of capital. We're still able to underwrite those mid-teens or better development yields and stabilization. And because the pre-leasing is at historically high levels, it's a very low risk way to deploy capital. And we actually get a stabilization even sooner. So we think it's a great use of our capital to do that. We'll continue to fund those developments in our campuses as aggressively as we can sell and build. And so we'll let you know kind of when we lay out our expectations for 2025 where that lands, but the numbers that you're suggesting are in the ballpark of something that could be very reasonable for us to do.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot, Steve.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first of all strategically, Steve, you laid out some of the attractive qualities of European Tower business on an organic basis. At the same time, some of the owners of European Tower assets have been more vocal that they're open to potential sales. So I guess all else equal, is it fair to conclude this would be an area where you might consider an acquisition of scale over the coming quarters or years? And then secondly, on the CoreSite business, a couple of things I noted. One is a large land purchase in the quarter. Is that related to CoreSite and the new site development there that you're anticipating? And then I think you also made a comment on maybe inference being a little bit slower to materialize in your initial expectations. So maybe if you could unpack that -- those two things a little bit, that would be great. Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Sure. So I'll start with the -- let me start with the CoreSite just because that's the most recent you asked. The land purchase that we did was in LA. And that's to expand our LA campus and that's to make sure we have a continued runway to continue to serve our customers there. So that's again, you'll see us continue to invest in land around our campuses and that just gives us more capacity to continue to build and grow over time. And that's what that one was. In terms of inferencing, I don't think it's been slower to develop than we thought. That was the edge that I was talking about that's been a little bit slower to develop than we thought. The inferencing layer, we're seeing some robust demand for that. And in fact, we're able to be very selective about the counterparty risk that we're taking there. We think that we're at ideal place for inferencing because that's really the distribution channel, how you interact with the large learning models. And we've certainly seen a lot of interest in that and we are writing some contracts with that. But there are a lot of kind of unproven businesses out there. So we're being very selective about that counterparty risk. In terms of Europe, we would love to be able to replicate what we did with Telxius and other markets. We don't feel like we have to do that. We have adequate scale in Germany and Spain. We'd like to find some more scale in France if we could because we're a little bit subscale there. But we have to be patient and disciplined. We've seen a number of portfolios trade in Europe that had terms and conditions that just aren't conducive to long-term shareholder value growth in terms of the way we see it. And so we've reiterated those kind of factors a few times, but terms and conditions are very important to us as are the counterparties that we're contracting with as well as the overall colocation dynamic. And what's working so well for us today in Europe is we have very low churn. We bought towers at a low tenancy. We have very little risk of some of the consolidation we're seeing in Spain and other markets. And we're seeing some competitive dynamics emerge in Europe that just weren't there in the past decade or so where you're seeing people competing on network quality a little bit compared to what they were in the past and that's promoting some builds. And you couple that with the real push by the governments to get ubiquitous coverage everywhere, including the rural areas, it's a great dynamic for us. So if there were portfolios that came available in Europe that had similar characteristics some more terms and conditions at the right valuation, I would certainly be interested, but we're not going to rush into anything and we're not going to buy things that don't meet our investment criteria that create that long-term value chain.\nRod Smith: Hey, James. Maybe when it comes to Europe, maybe I'll just highlight a couple of revenue items for you here. So you've heard us say in the past that we're very happy with the European business that we have. It's outperforming our original expectations. I'll just hone in on the organic tenant billings growth. We hit another quarter where we were over 6% OTBG for Europe. We're looking at about 6% for the full year. And that's a very balanced 6%. So we're -- in the quarter, we were a little over 4% contributions from organic new biz. That has been accelerating for the last several quarters. It is higher than it was in any quarter in the last six quarters or so. So we're seeing an accelerated level of activity in the market, which we like a lot. The escalator is right around 3% and the churn rate continues to be below 1%. So it's a very balanced revenue generation model that we've been able to build there and we're very excited about the platform that we have and the durability of the way that that business could grow. It looks very much like the US in terms of those numbers.\nOperator: Anything further, Mr. Schneider?\nJames Schneider: No, thank you. That's great.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Back to the domestic operations. Can you talk about if you're seeing any change in the colocation versus amendment mix? And to the extent that DISH starts to expand its network, is it mostly included in the holistic agreement that you have right now or could there be upside? And one thing quickly on domestic gross margins. I think they were down a little bit year-on-year. Is there anything to call out there? Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Sure. I'll talk about the demand trends and, Rod, you can talk about the gross margin. Overall, the mix that we're seeing is pretty consistent today, but we're seeing more interest in new colos. So we're getting -- we're having requests for information like what [rad] (ph) centers are available, what\u2019s the structural capacity. Those kind of precede the applications typically as we're doing our planning. And the conversations we're having certainly indicate that they're moving into a densification phase that will shift more to new colos. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. In terms of how they work in our comprehensive agreements, every one of those agreements is a little bit differently -- works a little bit differently. Some of them are just amendments only. So in those agreements, all the new colocations are incremental. And in some of those, they may include a limited amount of colocations. And once they reach that number of colocations that's in the comprehensive agreement, the incremental over that would be extra outside of the comprehensive agreements. And so as we constructed our long-term guide, we always knew that we would get to this densification phase and that the contribution from new colocation outside of the comprehensive agreements will become a larger factor and that's what we expect to see over the next several years. We expect to see this ramp-up in colocations that will add into the growth that we're expecting to see over the next several years. And that's very consistent with what we're starting to hear from customers as they're planning for the next phase of their network development.\nRod Smith: Hey, Batya, thanks for joining the call. So on the margins, I'll just hit the total margins and this applies to the domestic margins as well because the things I'll describe are really in the domestic business. But we had margins for the quarter a year ago for Q3 of 2023 of about 74.7%. That's down to 74.2%. So you look at that and it's a 50 basis-point reduction. The largest call out that I would highlight for you is the straight line impact there is about a negative 90 basis point hit to that margin. So of course, we all know straight line is a non-cash item and it just kind of goes -- it -- it's a dwindling balance here as we kind of run through that straight line curve. So on a cash basis, the margins really increased 40 bps, 50 bps, not decreased. And then there's a few other small things, some one-time settlements in the prior year that's not reoccurring, things like that. But the straight line balance coming through is the biggest change -- is the biggest impact that makes it the reported margins come down, but the cash margins are actually going up.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Okay.\nSteve Vondran: Batya, one quick clarification on the MLAs. This is largely a new lease comprehensive agreement. So that when the new colocations would be included until they get to the maximum number of leases under that agreement, which we don't expect to happen for some time.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson.\nNick Del Deo: Hey, good morning, guys. Steve, in your prepared remarks, I think you said that you're more convinced than ever that mobile edge is going to eventually be an opportunity even if it's taking a bit longer to transpire. I guess, are there specific conversations or data points or other things you can point to help us understand that increased level of conviction?\nSteve Vondran: Sure. So what I would say is, we've got a few proofs of concepts that we're working on with some partners on some kind of niche use cases. But the underlying theme that we're seeing from really kind of the whole ecosystem and I would point to the ecosystem at CoreSite is you're seeing more decentralization. So you're seeing the cloud providers and the AI providers start looking at more distributed architecture today. And the first phase of that is going to more regional centers. And that's what you're seeing driving a lot of the hyperscale activity that's out there, is you're seeing people diversify into more regions. Some of that is to take advantage of power costs but some of that's also to get closer to the end user and the lower latency and transport costs. And so, as we see that continuing to emerge, we think that will continue. And the conversations we're having with those types of players are that they want to continue to diversify over time. So they'll go to more regional facilities for a period of time. They're looking at Tier-2 markets, which is something that we're exploring with CoreSite is looking at expanding our presence in a couple of Tier-2 markets. You saw us do that in Miami a couple of years ago. We're still looking for opportunities to do that. And then that kind of diversification will continue until it gets out to the wireless edge, we believe over time. At the same time, we're seeing our carrier customers start talking about going to 5G standalone infrastructure versus the non-standalone 5G that's been deployed to date. And as you look at what's happening across the globe, you're seeing carriers that go to 5G standalone look at mobile edge compute more and more. So as we kind of look at both sides of that ecosystem, the wireline and the wireless, they're both going into an architecture that suggests the need for more compute at the edge. And so as we have those conversations and talk about what that eventual plan is and talk with them about what that infrastructure needs to look like at the edge, we're becoming more convinced than ever that that's going to happen. And that's really kind of what I'd point you to. Again, it's taking longer than we thought. You had to get the 5G standalone on the wireless side for that to make sense. And on the wireline side there's a little bit of evolution that has to happen to get into that more distributed architecture. But once we -- once that momentum starts, they'll keep pushing out further and further towards the consumer.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you, Steve. And then one other on, thinking about some of your emerging tower markets. You've been clear in your words and actions that you're tightening up CapEx there. I guess, has there been any sort of customer reaction to that decision? So for example, customer engagement with respect to discussing larger commitments, maybe if you're not willing to put as much CapEx behind new builds or anything along those lines?\nSteve Vondran: We've been engaging with our customers on that. They understand the issues. I mean they're good business people. Of course, they would love for us to invest more capital there, but they understand that we need to run our business in a way that creates shareholder value. And so if you look at what we were -- we've been able to talk about publicly where we renegotiated an agreement that results in lower CapEx and more co-locations, that's a result of a customer appreciating the situation we're in and working together to find a win-win solution. And we think that we have the opportunity to continue to do that with those customers. We do want to support our Tier-1 MNOs across the globe. That's an important business for us. We do think that we will continue to see growth in those emerging markets over time. And so we're not saying we're spending no capital. We're just reducing the capital spend there and focusing more in the developed markets. So certainly, customers are a huge piece of that and they've been very receptive to working with us to find the right solution for them and for us.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Thanks, Steve.\nSteve Vondran: So I guess I should say thank you to all of our customers who are listening for understanding and working with us on that.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Steve, I think I heard in your answer to Ric's question earlier that you said contracted growth under your MLAs steps down next year. Why is that? Do you guys have another customer who comes off their holistic MLA next year? And then for Rod or Steve, do the assumptions for mid-4% organic billings growth next year in the US include the assumption that churn excluding Sprint should be maintained in the sub 1% range, which it's been the last couple of quarters? Thanks.\nSteve Vondran: Sure. So, we don't have anyone rolling off a comprehensive agreement. When we structure those agreements, we typically try to structure the revenue toward the activity levels that we're seeing because we don't want to lose the time value of money. And so when you have a densification or when you have a phased building of a 5G network, you don't want to completely smooth it out. It smooths out the peaks and valley some, but you don't want to lose the time value of money for the earlier phases in that. So there's just a little bit of a step down there. But that also corresponds to an increase in new co-locations in the densification phase of it. And so we -- in terms of the kind of mid 4s, we do expect our churn to be at the lower end of the historical range, which was 1% to 2%. We're expecting to be at the lower end of the, but we don't want to get too specific on what that is because it's too early. We're still waiting to size that up before we can give you exact numbers.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan.\nRichard Choe: Hi. I just wanted to get an update on the cost management initiatives. And I guess along with that, you pulled back on CapEx on some of the emerging markets, but how should we think about potential divestitures in some of these markets where you feel like you're not of enough scale or the trends can take a long time to turn around? Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Sure. So we continue to work on cost management, and SG&A has been a particular focus for us, because that's kind of the low hanging fruit and we continue to make progress on that. And so if you look at kind of cash SG&A excluding bad debt, kind of year-over-year September year-to-date '24 versus '23, excluding the bad debt, it's down about $17 million or 3% over that period of time. So we're still seeing some savings there. Our cost management overall though is more comprehensive than that. We're looking at different ways to globalize parts of our business that'll take longer to realize some of the synergies that we think we can get in terms of looking at a more global approach to things like finance and operations. And we'll continue to explore those. So I do think over time you'll see some savings. It probably won't be as rapid as the savings we had in SG&A, but we think we can continue to expand margins over time with that. And sorry, what was the second part of your question there, Richard?\nRichard Choe: And then on the emerging markets that I guess where you don't feel like you have enough scale or the\u2026\nSteve Vondran: Yeah. So there's nothing I would point to, certainly nothing on the scale of India. In the quarter, we did sign an agreement to sell some third-party land that we had in Australia, New Zealand. And we do have a few land portfolios, fiber businesses, things like that. If we were able to realize the right price line, you might see us look at that, but there's no kind of active process that I would point you to on that. But just to kind of reiterate, we've divested India, Mexico fiber, we divested, we exited Poland. So we are continuing to look at the portfolio. And for us, the real question is, can someone else realize more value on our business than we can. And if they can, then that probably creates more value for our shareholders to monetize it. And so there's nothing specific that I would point to, but the Board and the management team is always looking at all aspects of the business, trying to figure out what the right solution is for each market.\nRichard Choe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.\nAdam Smith: Thank you for everyone for joining the call today. Like Rod said earlier, if there's any questions regarding the representation of discontinued operations or if you have any other questions regarding the results and outlook in general, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay. The replay information will be available on the American Tower website. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in this morning's press release, adjusted for certain non-cash items in the quarter, including the loss taken upon closing our ATC India sale, our solid third quarter results continue to highlight strong demand across our exceptional portfolio of global assets. These durable demand trends, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, continued focus on cost management and strong balance sheet, position us to deliver sustained high-quality earnings, growth and shareholder returns over the long term. Before I dive into our results, I want to highlight a key reporting change as it relates to the successful closing of our ATC India sale on September 12th. You will now see historical results associated with our India business reported as discontinued operations, represented as a standalone line item on the income statement, balance sheet, and in our reconciliations to attributable AFFO. As such, certain reported measures, including revenues and expenses within the income statement and non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA and tenant billings, will now be presented to exclude discontinued operations. I encourage you to refer to the definitions and footnotes throughout our Q3 earnings presentation and press release for added clarity on how the discontinued operations treatment is reflected in our results. Additionally, we have introduced new metrics, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders or attributable AFFO as adjusted, and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share or attributable AFFO per share as adjusted. These new metrics represent results from continuing operations adjusted for a full period of interest expense savings associated with the use of proceeds from the India sale. The intent of these as adjusted metrics is to provide investors with what we believe our continuing operations would produce an attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. We believe this will be useful in determining an appropriate baseline for future periods. Now, a few highlights from the quarter. First, in the third quarter, demand for our global portfolio of assets remained strong as we saw a continued acceleration in application volumes in the US, which nearly doubled those of the prior year period and similar growth in our services gross margin. Internationally, mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth was supported by another quarter of accelerating new business contributions in Europe and double-digit organic growth in Africa. International organic growth was complemented by selective new site construction, including the fourth consecutive quarter of over 100 sites in Europe and approximately 500 new sites overall. As Steve mentioned, demand in our US data center business remains exceptionally strong and well in excess of our initial underwriting as CoreSite is on track for its third consecutive record year of new leasing, supporting year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. Next, complementing the demand trends driving our top line results, we continue to execute strategic priorities laid out earlier this year. On the cost management side, third quarter SG&A, excluding bad debt declined nearly 2% year-over-year, supporting cash-adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 30 basis points as compared to the prior year period. We also made progress in optimizing our portfolio, closing our India sale and signing agreements to sell our land interests in Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, we further strengthened the balance sheet by using ATC India sale proceeds to reduce gross debt and we expect further reductions from efficient repatriation in the near term. Importantly, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-minus during the quarter, signaling our momentum in executing key financial and operating strategies to enhance our balance sheet strength, financial flexibility and portfolio quality. These achievements reinforce our commitment to actively assess our global portfolio to focus on platforms where we can drive high-quality earnings and earnings growth, outsized returns and compelling total shareholder value over the long-term. Finally, on the customer front, we took certain provisions in Colombia related to WOM, who filed for the equivalent of US bankruptcy earlier this year. Any outcome of the potential reorganization is uncertain and it would be premature to speculate, but we began recognizing revenue on a cash basis and reserved a portion of outstanding AR as bad debt. In the third quarter, this resulted in revenue reserves of $13 million, including $3 million in straight line and another $8 million recognized as bad debt expense. For context, WOM Columbia's gross revenue makes up approximately 1.5% and less than 0.5% of our total Latin America and consolidated property revenues respectively. Turning to third quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 6. Consolidated property revenue declined approximately 1% year-over-year and increased nearly 1% excluding non-cash straight-line revenue. Growth was negatively impacted by roughly 3% due to FX as well as by the non-recurrence of certain one-time benefits in the US in the prior year period and revenue reserves taken in the current period in Colombia. As I mentioned, performance was supported by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our US Data Center business. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was over 5%. In our US and Canada segment, growth was 5% or approximately 6% absent Sprint related churn. As we have previously indicated, we expect to see a step-down towards 4% growth in Q4 due to the commencement of the final tranche of Sprint churn, consistent with prior outlook assumptions. On the international side, growth was 5.7%, representing an enhancement of over 100 basis points compared to prior expectations through the exclusion of the India business. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA declined approximately 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the revenue drivers, I just discussed. Growth excluding non-cash straight-line was just over 2%, benefiting from disciplined cost management and a roughly 100% increase in our services gross margin associated with an increase in tower activity. Growth was negatively impacted approximately 3% by FX headwinds. Moving to the right side of the slide, AFFO attributable to American Tower common stockholders increased 2.6% year-over-year, driven by the high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to AFFO through the effective management of interest costs, maintenance CapEx and cash taxes, partially offset by the timing of our India sale. On an as adjusted per share basis, growth would have stood at nearly 3%. Now shifting to our revised full year outlook. I'll start with a few key updates. First, outlook has been adjusted for the close of our India transaction. As a result, historical India results will now be treated as discontinued operations and as such, our property revenue, organic tenant billings and adjusted EBITDA will exclude India contributions for the full year. Our reported AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders will include contributions from discontinued operations up to the date of closing. Prior year periods have been adjusted accordingly. Next, our core business and the drivers that underpin our performance remain solid. As a company, we're focused on executing on a strong pipeline of new business demand, driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the global business and effectively allocating our capital in a manner that supports sustained value creation. As you'll see, we're absorbing provisions in our outlook related to WOM, consisting of $21 million in incremental revenue reserves, including $3 million in straight-line and an additional $15 million in bad debt expense, which combined represent $36 million in downside to adjusted EBITDA and $33 million to AFFO relative to our prior outlook. However, we're more than offsetting that exposure through direct expense savings and an anticipated settlement with a customer in Brazil associated with the cancellation of future lease obligations, the latter contributing $35 million of upside. Lastly, our revised FX assumptions include an incremental headwind of $25 million, $20 million and $17 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders respectively. Turning to Slide 8, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue from continuing operations by approximately $15 million. This outperformance includes $15 million of core upside, primarily driven by our data center segment and the one-time customer settlement in Brazil, partially offset by WOM related reserves and an anticipated delay in certain non-run rate reimbursements in the US, which we now expect to receive in 2025. Non-core outperformance is driven by increases in pass through revenue and straight-line. Total outperformance was partially offset by FX. Moving to Slide 9. Organic tenant billings growth expectations for consolidated US and Canada, Africa, Europe and Latin America remain unchanged with trends and catalysts consistent with our prior assumptions. The removal of the lower-growth India business did increase our international expectation by roughly 100 basis points from the prior outlook to approximately 6% and provides a modest benefit to our consolidated company expectations, though not enough to move our expectation of approximately 5%. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by $5 million. This outperformance is driven by the revenue drivers I just mentioned, together with incremental operating expenses upside achieved through a combination of recurring savings from various strategic initiatives as well as certain non-recurring benefits, gross margin expectations for our US services business remain intact. Although certain anticipated project delays into 2025 will likely bring our revenue modestly below initial estimates. Partially offsetting the benefits to adjusted EBITDA, we've assumed $15 million of additional bad debt expense associated with WOM and another $20 million in FX unfavorability. Moving to Slide 11. Adjusting our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook midpoint of $10.60 to the timing of the India closing resulted in approximately $0.12 of dilution, leading to a midpoint of $10.48 per share. This is directionally consistent with the dilution expectations communicated on past calls. Relative to prior outlook, adjusted for the ATC India closing, our revised outlook reflects upside of $0.05, moving the midpoint to $10.53 per share. Improvements include approximately $0.05 in outperformance from our India business through the September 12th closing date and the 100% conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA upside from our continuing operations on a currency neutral basis, which is largely offset by the impacts of FX. On an as adjusted basis, the outlook midpoint remains consistent at $9.95 per share, reflecting the core outperformance in our continuing operations, offset by FX. Moving to Slide 12. Our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, except for the removal of $105 million of capital expenditures allocated to India in our prior outlook. Our planned dividend distribution remains at $6.48 per share with the expectation to resume growth in 2025, all subject to Board approval. In summary, at the start of the year, we laid out a compelling set of expectations for 2024, reflective of the strong durable data demand trends that continue to highlight the criticality of our real-estate assets. Our top line financial targets assumed accelerating demand in the US and Europe, ongoing growth through 5G coverage and 4G densification across our emerging markets and a continuation of near-record setting leasing in our data center segment. To capture that demand, we established a set of strategic priorities aimed to effectively support our customers needs and drive new business opportunities manage our costs and capital structure and optimize our portfolio through selective asset sales and refined capital allocation priorities to enhance margins and the quality of our earnings profile. Our accomplishments to date and expectations for the duration of the year reflect the successful execution across each of these priorities, we believe this momentum will position us for an even stronger future, enabling us to drive attractive high quality growth and shareholder value for years to come. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Hey, Ric. Maybe I would just add to that. In terms of 2024 levels of new business, we had provided you guys all a range of between $180 million and $190 million. And the way the year is shaping up, it's pretty consistent each quarter in terms of the amount of new biz that we loaded on. We expect that to be similar for Q4 as well, so pretty similar to the last three quarters which was all in and around a quarterly contribution of about mid-40s, $45 million or so. That would end up landing us at kind of the lower end of that range around $180 million and that's all kind of supportive of then transitioning into next year and hitting the numbers that Steve just talked about. Yeah. I think that's right, Ric. So fully appreciate that the numbers can be a little bit complicated with the addition of the sale of India and accounting for that under discontinued ops. I'll try to hit a couple of the highlights here. And certainly, for anyone on the call that wants to go through it in more granular detail, our Investor Relations group is here to walk you through all the detail. First, I'll take you from maybe the $10.60 going over the $10.53, which is kind of our AFFO numbers as reported, right? So the $10.60 -- $10.60 a share was the original outlook. We sold India at the beginning of the fourth quarter here. So that's out of our numbers for the fourth quarter. So that pulled out $0.12. That's just the elimination of the India contribution to AFFO per share for Q4, which they're no longer in there. So we stepped from $10.60 per share to $10.48. Then on an apples-to-apples basis, India outperformed by about $22 million. That was largely with cash tax refunds and a few other items. There's outperformance across cash-adjusted EBITDA of the $20 million we show. And then there's a little bit of FX headwind another $17 million going the other way, primarily in the Latin America countries. That bridges us over to the $4.930 billion, which is equal to $10.53. So that $10.53 still has India in there for the first three quarters. When you drop down to the $9.95, you're basically reducing that by $0.58, which is the combination of pulling out the India contributions to AFFO and also offsetting that with interest savings that we have by using the $2 billion proceeds and the cash we got out earlier than closing in the third -- second and third quarter, which we pulled out another almost $350 million. Using all those proceeds to pay down debt will reduce our interest costs. So the net of taking India contributions to AFFO out also combining that with the interest savings from using the proceeds to pay down debt is the $0.58 that gets you down to the $9.95. And then there is some timing issues in there and some outperformance in that number as well, basically the $22 million that I just talked about from India, the discontinued ops outperformance largely in terms of cash taxes. And that $9.95 is the best representation of our continuing operations AFFO per share for 2024. And that is a really good starting point to think about how the core business, the ongoing business will grow going forward. And as we said, we look forward to mid-single-digit growth rates kind of going forward and that holds true for 2025. So that would put us into next year on an apples-to-apples basis the $9.95. We think we can grow that into the $10.50 range for 2025 and that would be AFFO from continuing operations. And again, Ric, I appreciate that there's a lot of numbers in here and it may take a little bit of time going through with our Investor Relations team. But trust me, when you kind of look through it, it becomes much easier after you've had a few minutes to think about it. I know people on the phone have only gotten the press release earlier this morning and there's a lot to digest. But once you get through it, I think you'll understand it pretty clearly. Yeah. I think, Ric, certainly getting above mid-single-digits is absolutely possible. We are very happy with the portfolio that we have across the globe. We've been working very diligently to improve the quality of the earnings and selling the India business, removing that volatility from the business is a -- certainly a positive when you think of that. So the long-term growth algorithm still holds true just as we've talked in the past, certainly. We think that US business can grow in the mid-single digits, just like Steve walked through the long-term guide for US OTBG on average that 5%. We do think next year with that final tranche of the Sprint churn will be the low watermark and then it will spring back up in '26 and '27. And you think about that longer-term guide over that whole period, averaging 5%, we're still on track. We're still on track. So that the international business can grow faster than that certainly. We all know that CoreSite is outperforming our original expectations. We're hitting double-digit growth this quarter and will -- for Q3 and we expect double-digit growth here now going forward annually. And we've had two years of record new business in CoreSite and we're pretty well set to either tie that or maybe even set a new record in 2024. So CoreSite is going exceptionally well. We've been very focused on cost controls, expanding margins, managing cash taxes, watching the balance sheet and reducing exposure to floating-rate debt. You put all that together and yes, the portfolio is strong and it's getting stronger as the quality of earnings go up and we've gotten through this interest headwind. So when you think about the longer term, we can get beyond that mid-single-digit growth rate. The areas to watch FX, we still have 25% of our earnings coming from Latin America and Africa. So that there is something that we will watch. And where interest rates go there's always uncertainty there. So we will watch that as well. And when it comes to CoreSite, I don't think we've given a specific number in terms of what sales are, but you can think about it as a factor of what they were doing pre-acquisition. That build pipeline, just for reference, we've got about over 40 megawatts of construction ongoing today. It's about 60% pre-leased today and that's replacing the capacity we've sold. So the way to think about that is, their leasing today is significantly higher than the year before we bought them. And the majority of our $70 million backlog that we have today is commencing between now and kind of the first half of 2025 and the remainder is beyond that. So we haven't given a specific sale number. We are giving you guys the backlog and that's the way to think about that revenue growth. We feel very confident in a high single or double-digit, most likely double-digit growth rate for the next several years in terms of revenue commencing there. And that continued strength continues to feed that sales pipeline and we're expecting to have a healthy pipeline in 2025 as well. At this point, all those general dynamics we're seeing in the industry are just continue to accelerate and that is demand for hybrid. Hybrid cloud infrastructure by enterprises is our bread and butter. That's where you continue to see strength in it. And we're starting to see those enterprises now deploy GPUs, their own kind of AI based models and that again is kind of the perfect customer for CoreSite. So we're seeing our existing customers increasing the size of their installations and that's going to keep feeding that pipeline for years to come. So we feel like that growth rate is durable for the foreseeable future right now. Yeah, sounds good, Simon. I'll take the dividend question and then Steve will talk to you about the CapEx for CoreSite. So with the dividend, as we talked about on the last call, we do look forward to resuming dividend growth as we get into 2025. I don't want to get into too much detail in terms of what that growth rate might be, but similar to the way we've discussed it in prior calls, the long-term view of the dividend growth rate is that it will closely mirror the average AFFO per share growth rate over time. So that's the way we think about it. So, if we are hitting a mid-single-digit AFFO per share growth rate on average over time, we would expect that the dividend growth rate on average over that same time period would roughly equal that same kind of a growth rate. That's the way to think about it. You can't really apply that to every individual year because there could be puts and takes. But over time, I think you kind of get the trajectory there. Now, of course, with dividend and dividend policy, every quarter we go to our Board and ask them to approve the dividend declaration and distribution, we would always do that. So everything I'm talking about here is subject to Board approval. But we do -- again, the portfolio that we have is strong. It's getting stronger with the quality of earnings increasing, the balance sheet becoming stronger. So achieving that mid-single-digit AFFO per share growth rate may be driving that up from there as we talked about with Ric's question, that all would kind of tie into our ability to grow the dividend. And if that dividend grows in line with AFFO per share, we do see the dividend payout as a percent of AFFO staying roughly where it is, which, call it, between 60 and mid-60s kind of in that range. That leaves us another $1.5 billion to $2 billion-ish to deploy into our CapEx programs around the globe or use it to buy back shares or we can allocate it to debt reductions if we wanted to, but it still leaves us with plenty of excess capital to run the business. Hey, James. Maybe when it comes to Europe, maybe I'll just highlight a couple of revenue items for you here. So you've heard us say in the past that we're very happy with the European business that we have. It's outperforming our original expectations. I'll just hone in on the organic tenant billings growth. We hit another quarter where we were over 6% OTBG for Europe. We're looking at about 6% for the full year. And that's a very balanced 6%. So we're -- in the quarter, we were a little over 4% contributions from organic new biz. That has been accelerating for the last several quarters. It is higher than it was in any quarter in the last six quarters or so. So we're seeing an accelerated level of activity in the market, which we like a lot. The escalator is right around 3% and the churn rate continues to be below 1%. So it's a very balanced revenue generation model that we've been able to build there and we're very excited about the platform that we have and the durability of the way that that business could grow. It looks very much like the US in terms of those numbers. Hey, Batya, thanks for joining the call. So on the margins, I'll just hit the total margins and this applies to the domestic margins as well because the things I'll describe are really in the domestic business. But we had margins for the quarter a year ago for Q3 of 2023 of about 74.7%. That's down to 74.2%. So you look at that and it's a 50 basis-point reduction. The largest call out that I would highlight for you is the straight line impact there is about a negative 90 basis point hit to that margin. So of course, we all know straight line is a non-cash item and it just kind of goes -- it -- it's a dwindling balance here as we kind of run through that straight line curve. So on a cash basis, the margins really increased 40 bps, 50 bps, not decreased. And then there's a few other small things, some one-time settlements in the prior year that's not reoccurring, things like that. But the straight line balance coming through is the biggest change -- is the biggest impact that makes it the reported margins come down, but the cash margins are actually going up."

            "name": "Steve Vondran",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in our Q3 results, demand remains strong across our global portfolio of real-estate assets. In our Tower business, our customers' efforts to deploy mid-band 5G for additional coverage continue to support a healthy pipeline of activity across the US, Europe and parts of our emerging markets. The discussions we're having with our carrier customers about their need to address upcoming capacity requirements, particularly in the US, further reinforce our bullish expectations for the densification phase of the 5G investment cycle. Additionally, our data center segment delivered another fantastic quarter of leasing, benefiting from accelerating hybrid IT deployments and early signs of AI-related demand. To complement our top line growth, we're executing our previously stated strategic initiative to enhance our portfolio composition and improve the quality of earnings by focusing our discretionary capital in developed markets and closing our India sale. I want to thank all the teams involved in the sale process for their efforts and dedication to getting the deal over the finish line and for ensuring a successful outcome for both American Tower and Brookfield. Finally, we continue to add value by managing our cost structure to maximize conversion rates, expand our margins and drive profitability across our business. We remain committed to executing on all these strategic priorities that position American Tower to deliver durable, high quality earnings growth over the long term. On our last call, I talked through the key lessons learned from our historical capital investments that have led us to refine our approach to investment underwriting and prioritize capital deployment to our developed markets. Having recently covered the US tower market where demand remains firmly intact, I'll focus today's remarks on our other developed market platforms, Europe and CoreSite. However, I'd first like to recognize the critical efforts of our US teams who have been working with our customers to rapidly restore essential communication and emergency services to those communities affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I really appreciate all their hard work. So now I'd like to highlight trends in our European and CoreSite businesses, which are each positioned to capture high rates of organic growth and provide opportunities to further invest where returns meet our standards. I'll start with Europe. As we've highlighted on past calls, we were highly disciplined in our approach to inter-select European markets at scale, and we're seeing that patience pay off. In our assessment of Europe, we leveraged our global underwriting and operating experience to effectively evaluate the most attractive markets. Our criteria included macroeconomic stability, government support for mobile connectivity, healthy carrier and counterparty profiles and critical contract terms and conditions. Additionally, we sought market and competitive dynamics where we believe that our value proposition as a true independent operator with over two decades of global experience could successfully deliver a best-in-class customer experience that affords outsized new business and enhanced margins. This rigorous assessment led to the acquisition of select portfolios across Germany, France and Spain, where mobile data consumption is expected to grow at about a 20% CAGR over the next five years and where governments have advocated for nationwide coverage through various activities, including spectrum auctions and subsidy programs like the new deal in France, Spain's 5G UNICO to support rural 5G development and the Gigabit Infrastructure Act at the broader EU level. Importantly, these markets also present a healthy carrier environment, including increased competition in Germany and Spain through new entrants as well as strong market leaders with whom we contract for the majority of our business. Approximately 85% of our revenues in Europe are indexed to carriers with at least a 25% share in their respective markets. This provides a high degree of insulation from further consolidation risk, maintaining our very low exposure to ongoing consolidation in Spain, while providing visibility into sustained growth and quality earnings over the long term. And although land sharing is a reality in certain parts of these markets, we mitigate its impact with well-structured customer agreements that allow us to either monetize such sharing or provide certain revenue protections that support our growth objectives. American Tower is uniquely positioned to unlock opportunities in Germany, France and Spain where the neutral host independent tower model is still relatively nascent. Leveraging our considerable experience and capabilities can help solve persistent operational challenges experienced by the carriers and infrastructure operators throughout past network cycles. Since closing the Telxius acquisition, which increased our asset count in the region over five times, we further enhanced our ability to serve our customers by internalizing critical activities that align with our global competencies, reducing reliance on external vendors, strengthening our process management leadership and when possible, integrating our teams directly with our customers to expedite decision making and improved processes. Our disciplined approach to market entry and effective operational execution have yielded an attractive growth profile in Europe. On the organic side, healthy carrier demand combined with the benefit of CPI linked escalators have yielded an average of over 7% organic tenant billings growth over the past three years and we remain confident in driving organic growth, in line with our mid-single-digit expectations in the region going forward. To complement this organic growth, we also invested in increased newbuild activity, delivering 1,200 new sites since the start of 2021. Additionally, we've improved the process of getting new colocations on air to further evolve the neutral host model and reduce the carrier's total cost of ownership. This required engagement with regulators, landlords, tenants, vendors and the enhancement of our own internal skill sets that's paying off as approximately 70% of our expected organic new business growth in 2024 is coming through colocations, of which over a quarter are on rooftops. Taken altogether, we see a long runway of sustained growth with optionality to further capitalize on a multi-year pipeline of attractive development opportunities. As carriers continue to rapidly deploy mid-band spectrum and densify their networks to meet insatiable data demand, we'll continue to assess opportunities using both the principles that shaped our investments for over a decade and the recent learnings we've institutionalized. Now, I'll switch to our data center business. We also see long-term demand trends within our US data center segment, which like our European portfolio, provides a platform for incremental development opportunities underwritten at very attractive return profiles. Since closing the CoreSite transaction at the end of 2021, we've achieved record-breaking leasing each year and are on pace again to deliver a new high mark in 2024. As we've highlighted on past calls, our portfolio is optimally positioned to benefit from accelerating demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture due to its ability to facilitate seamless, secure, nationwide low-latency interoperability, including native cloud access to a diverse set of customers. Critically, we believe that CoreSite's interconnection campus model, which can be extended to distributed endpoints to support the low-latency and cost-efficiency required for future use cases, represents a potentially distinct option for new synergistic revenue opportunities when combined with our tower assets at the edge. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that the mobile edge is going to present a meaningful addressable market for us, in part due to the rapid acceleration in AI deployments and the infrastructure required to accommodate future latency-sensitive workloads like inferencing. And while the timing might be delayed relative to our initial expectations, we continue to expect synergies between our Tower and CoreSite platforms over the long -term. In the meantime, we're realizing the benefits of the step-function of AI demand and our leasing results at CoreSite. AI-driven workloads are a growing component of CoreSite's signed leasing and customer requirements are indicating that demand will only grow over the near-to-medium term. Over the past several quarters, enterprises have started to build their own GPU space architectures connecting to the cloud either through auto-ramps or our virtual OCX offering. These deployments resemble typical hybrid IT architecture, but they're larger and more power-dense. As with virtually all workloads across the AI spectrum, our facilities are well-equipped to accommodate this need. More indirectly, our data center portfolio is also benefiting from hyperscale AI absorption that's consuming a record level of capacity throughout our key markets, exacerbating the supply-and-demand imbalance and further supporting the favorable pricing environment for both new leasing and renewals into the foreseeable future. Given the healthy demand catalyst that we see persisting for many years to come, attractive rates of return that are de-risked through accelerated preleasing activity, we plan to allocate more capital to CoreSite over the next several years, likely meeting or exceeding the $480 million in development spend assumed at the midpoint of our 2024 guide. Recently, I've received questions as to whether we'd be interested in participating in the extensive hyperscale development taking place in the market today. We see a long runway ahead for CoreSite's retail-oriented approach, which has yielded industry-leading returns on a sustained basis as our facilities continue to meet and in certain cases exceed our initial expectations for mid-teen stabilized yields. Thus single-tenant hyperscale opportunities are not a priority unless there was a clear opportunity for one to serve as a seed for a new campus or if there were compelling opportunities to invest with our JV partner, Stonepeak. Today, we're prioritizing the expansion of existing campuses, new ground-up facilities adjacent to existing campuses or potentially selected expansion of our national ecosystem by establishing new campuses and new markets. We remain focused on developing multi-tenant colocation facilities, methodically curating the mix of customers deployed within our facilities to enhance the value of our interconnection ecosystem and effectively planning for long-term absorption and power needs. In closing, American Tower has built a global platform of assets that are well-positioned to capitalize on the exponential rise in data demand. Our CoreSite data center business and European tower operation are both differentiated by asset quality and best-in-class operations, creating a leading experience for our customers as they deploy the critical networks and applications of today and the future. These businesses are uniquely positioned to deliver attractive sustained organic growth and provide optionality for us to assess future opportunities for investment. This portfolio strength, combined with demand catalysts across our global portfolio and the ongoing progress we're making in executing the strategic priorities I laid out earlier in this year, position American Tower extremely well to deliver high-quality earnings growth and total shareholder returns for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q3 performance and our updated outlook. Rod? Good morning, Rick. Yes. I'll take that, Ric. It's still too early to give guidance for next year. There's still some moving pieces in it. But if you look at the, in particular, the US business, we are hearing a lot of good conversation from our customers about the beginnings of the densification phase. And that's right in line with what we thought was going to happen. And so if you think about next year, in terms of the leasing in the US, we still have this final tranche of Sprint churn that's hitting in October this year that will weigh on the US a bit. And so when you kind of couple that with the kind of leasing environment that we're seeing, what's contractually already committed growth under our comprehensive MLAs, which does tick down just a little bit next year, that's most likely you're going to see us kind of in that mid-4s range in terms of the US growth rate for next year. And that's consistent with our long-term guide of at least 5% from '23 to '27, because if you think about '26 and '27, at that point, we're through the spread churn. And so if you look at 2025 through that lens, we still have about 100 basis points of churn coming in from that final Sprint churn tranche. So if you normalize that out, that's kind of be the mid-5s for next year. So that's kind of the way to think about sizing it and exactly where in that mid-4s range we're going to be, we're not sure yet. We do have one customer that's not uncomprehensive. So there's some volume-driven things with that. We also are hearing some interest from customers in new colocations that would be outside of our comprehensive MLAs. We don't know if that's going to fall in the early part of '25 or the later part of '25 or '26. We're still trying to figure that out. There's a few moving pieces there but directionally, you can think about it kind of being in that mid-4s range. Yeah. And I would just add in, Ric, if you think about kind of our long-term growth algorithm, couple of components to watch out for there. The first is Latin America. Over time, we believe that will come back to high single-digit growth. But for the next few years, we are projecting low single-digit growth in there based on care consolidation churn that's primarily OI, but it's also some potential consolidation that we see kind of on the map. We're seeing some challenges with WOM and there may be a little bit more consolidation there. And that's why we think for the next few years, that's going to be a low single-digits. Once we get past that, that won't be a headwind for us. And we are past the US Sprint churn after the end of this year. So that will be a positive for us. And so the swing factors will really be on what's going to happen with FX over time. And while we have reduced our exposure to it, 25% of our attributable AFFO is still attributable to our emerging markets. So there is still some FX risk there. And just in the last few weeks, we've seen a negative trend in that, that's resulted in a little bit of degradation for next year, just in the past few weeks. And then the other piece is interest rate headwinds and I think it's anybody's guess as to what exactly happens with interest rates over the next few years. So those are the things we'll be watching. But that long-term algorithm of mid to high single-digits holds true even while absorbing some of those costs in there. You're welcome. Yeah, David, we'll certainly talk about that metric for as long as it's applicable, which will be a little while until we lap this India sale. But while the India sale and the discontinued operations is in our base number or the comparable prior year numbers, we will let you know what it is. Yeah. And, David, maybe I would just add, in terms of the relationship with the prior numbers, our backlog in that $70 million range, that's up from a number in the range of $40 million or so when we bought CoreSite in those first couple of years. So it's up 75% or so. And that's a similar level of increase that we're seeing in the new biz roughly. And on the CapEx for CoreSite, we're not constraining the business. So the business has the opportunity to deploy as much capital as it wants. And so you could see that number grow kind of into that range that you're talking about. And I would also just reiterate that the beauty of how we've constructed our CoreSite entity with our private capital partners is, we have a lot of optionality in terms of how we fund that additional capital growth. So we'll be able to make the determination how much American Tower wants to put in versus how much we rely on our partners kind of real-time as we're looking at the budgets for next year. So it's too early to tell you what the budget is going to be and what percentage we're going to pay. But it's a very good use of capital. We're still able to underwrite those mid-teens or better development yields and stabilization. And because the pre-leasing is at historically high levels, it's a very low risk way to deploy capital. And we actually get a stabilization even sooner. So we think it's a great use of our capital to do that. We'll continue to fund those developments in our campuses as aggressively as we can sell and build. And so we'll let you know kind of when we lay out our expectations for 2025 where that lands, but the numbers that you're suggesting are in the ballpark of something that could be very reasonable for us to do. Sure. So I'll start with the -- let me start with the CoreSite just because that's the most recent you asked. The land purchase that we did was in LA. And that's to expand our LA campus and that's to make sure we have a continued runway to continue to serve our customers there. So that's again, you'll see us continue to invest in land around our campuses and that just gives us more capacity to continue to build and grow over time. And that's what that one was. In terms of inferencing, I don't think it's been slower to develop than we thought. That was the edge that I was talking about that's been a little bit slower to develop than we thought. The inferencing layer, we're seeing some robust demand for that. And in fact, we're able to be very selective about the counterparty risk that we're taking there. We think that we're at ideal place for inferencing because that's really the distribution channel, how you interact with the large learning models. And we've certainly seen a lot of interest in that and we are writing some contracts with that. But there are a lot of kind of unproven businesses out there. So we're being very selective about that counterparty risk. In terms of Europe, we would love to be able to replicate what we did with Telxius and other markets. We don't feel like we have to do that. We have adequate scale in Germany and Spain. We'd like to find some more scale in France if we could because we're a little bit subscale there. But we have to be patient and disciplined. We've seen a number of portfolios trade in Europe that had terms and conditions that just aren't conducive to long-term shareholder value growth in terms of the way we see it. And so we've reiterated those kind of factors a few times, but terms and conditions are very important to us as are the counterparties that we're contracting with as well as the overall colocation dynamic. And what's working so well for us today in Europe is we have very low churn. We bought towers at a low tenancy. We have very little risk of some of the consolidation we're seeing in Spain and other markets. And we're seeing some competitive dynamics emerge in Europe that just weren't there in the past decade or so where you're seeing people competing on network quality a little bit compared to what they were in the past and that's promoting some builds. And you couple that with the real push by the governments to get ubiquitous coverage everywhere, including the rural areas, it's a great dynamic for us. So if there were portfolios that came available in Europe that had similar characteristics some more terms and conditions at the right valuation, I would certainly be interested, but we're not going to rush into anything and we're not going to buy things that don't meet our investment criteria that create that long-term value chain. Sure. I'll talk about the demand trends and, Rod, you can talk about the gross margin. Overall, the mix that we're seeing is pretty consistent today, but we're seeing more interest in new colos. So we're getting -- we're having requests for information like what [rad] (ph) centers are available, what\u2019s the structural capacity. Those kind of precede the applications typically as we're doing our planning. And the conversations we're having certainly indicate that they're moving into a densification phase that will shift more to new colos. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. In terms of how they work in our comprehensive agreements, every one of those agreements is a little bit differently -- works a little bit differently. Some of them are just amendments only. So in those agreements, all the new colocations are incremental. And in some of those, they may include a limited amount of colocations. And once they reach that number of colocations that's in the comprehensive agreement, the incremental over that would be extra outside of the comprehensive agreements. And so as we constructed our long-term guide, we always knew that we would get to this densification phase and that the contribution from new colocation outside of the comprehensive agreements will become a larger factor and that's what we expect to see over the next several years. We expect to see this ramp-up in colocations that will add into the growth that we're expecting to see over the next several years. And that's very consistent with what we're starting to hear from customers as they're planning for the next phase of their network development. Batya, one quick clarification on the MLAs. This is largely a new lease comprehensive agreement. So that when the new colocations would be included until they get to the maximum number of leases under that agreement, which we don't expect to happen for some time. Sure. Sure. So what I would say is, we've got a few proofs of concepts that we're working on with some partners on some kind of niche use cases. But the underlying theme that we're seeing from really kind of the whole ecosystem and I would point to the ecosystem at CoreSite is you're seeing more decentralization. So you're seeing the cloud providers and the AI providers start looking at more distributed architecture today. And the first phase of that is going to more regional centers. And that's what you're seeing driving a lot of the hyperscale activity that's out there, is you're seeing people diversify into more regions. Some of that is to take advantage of power costs but some of that's also to get closer to the end user and the lower latency and transport costs. And so, as we see that continuing to emerge, we think that will continue. And the conversations we're having with those types of players are that they want to continue to diversify over time. So they'll go to more regional facilities for a period of time. They're looking at Tier-2 markets, which is something that we're exploring with CoreSite is looking at expanding our presence in a couple of Tier-2 markets. You saw us do that in Miami a couple of years ago. We're still looking for opportunities to do that. And then that kind of diversification will continue until it gets out to the wireless edge, we believe over time. At the same time, we're seeing our carrier customers start talking about going to 5G standalone infrastructure versus the non-standalone 5G that's been deployed to date. And as you look at what's happening across the globe, you're seeing carriers that go to 5G standalone look at mobile edge compute more and more. So as we kind of look at both sides of that ecosystem, the wireline and the wireless, they're both going into an architecture that suggests the need for more compute at the edge. And so as we have those conversations and talk about what that eventual plan is and talk with them about what that infrastructure needs to look like at the edge, we're becoming more convinced than ever that that's going to happen. And that's really kind of what I'd point you to. Again, it's taking longer than we thought. You had to get the 5G standalone on the wireless side for that to make sense. And on the wireline side there's a little bit of evolution that has to happen to get into that more distributed architecture. But once we -- once that momentum starts, they'll keep pushing out further and further towards the consumer. We've been engaging with our customers on that. They understand the issues. I mean they're good business people. Of course, they would love for us to invest more capital there, but they understand that we need to run our business in a way that creates shareholder value. And so if you look at what we were -- we've been able to talk about publicly where we renegotiated an agreement that results in lower CapEx and more co-locations, that's a result of a customer appreciating the situation we're in and working together to find a win-win solution. And we think that we have the opportunity to continue to do that with those customers. We do want to support our Tier-1 MNOs across the globe. That's an important business for us. We do think that we will continue to see growth in those emerging markets over time. And so we're not saying we're spending no capital. We're just reducing the capital spend there and focusing more in the developed markets. So certainly, customers are a huge piece of that and they've been very receptive to working with us to find the right solution for them and for us. So I guess I should say thank you to all of our customers who are listening for understanding and working with us on that. Sure. So, we don't have anyone rolling off a comprehensive agreement. When we structure those agreements, we typically try to structure the revenue toward the activity levels that we're seeing because we don't want to lose the time value of money. And so when you have a densification or when you have a phased building of a 5G network, you don't want to completely smooth it out. It smooths out the peaks and valley some, but you don't want to lose the time value of money for the earlier phases in that. So there's just a little bit of a step down there. But that also corresponds to an increase in new co-locations in the densification phase of it. And so we -- in terms of the kind of mid 4s, we do expect our churn to be at the lower end of the historical range, which was 1% to 2%. We're expecting to be at the lower end of the, but we don't want to get too specific on what that is because it's too early. We're still waiting to size that up before we can give you exact numbers. Sure. So we continue to work on cost management, and SG&A has been a particular focus for us, because that's kind of the low hanging fruit and we continue to make progress on that. And so if you look at kind of cash SG&A excluding bad debt, kind of year-over-year September year-to-date '24 versus '23, excluding the bad debt, it's down about $17 million or 3% over that period of time. So we're still seeing some savings there. Our cost management overall though is more comprehensive than that. We're looking at different ways to globalize parts of our business that'll take longer to realize some of the synergies that we think we can get in terms of looking at a more global approach to things like finance and operations. And we'll continue to explore those. So I do think over time you'll see some savings. It probably won't be as rapid as the savings we had in SG&A, but we think we can continue to expand margins over time with that. And sorry, what was the second part of your question there, Richard? Yeah. So there's nothing I would point to, certainly nothing on the scale of India. In the quarter, we did sign an agreement to sell some third-party land that we had in Australia, New Zealand. And we do have a few land portfolios, fiber businesses, things like that. If we were able to realize the right price line, you might see us look at that, but there's no kind of active process that I would point you to on that. But just to kind of reiterate, we've divested India, Mexico fiber, we divested, we exited Poland. So we are continuing to look at the portfolio. And for us, the real question is, can someone else realize more value on our business than we can. And if they can, then that probably creates more value for our shareholders to monetize it. And so there's nothing specific that I would point to, but the Board and the management team is always looking at all aspects of the business, trying to figure out what the right solution is for each market."

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Smith: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO, and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time to time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Vondran: Good morning. And thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As you can see in our Q2 results and our revised full year outlook, we continue to build on the strength we saw in the underlying business at the outset of the year, with further validation of our initial expectations for strong activity across our platforms in 2024. I want to start today's remarks by thanking our teams across the world for their commitment to operational excellence and dedication to maximizing sales, bringing down costs and expanding margins across the portfolio. My comments today will focus on our latest views on our international portfolio and aim to address some of the recurring questions related to our international strategy in both developed and emerging markets that we received from investors in recent months. As we've communicated in the past, our international investment thesis is two-pronged. First, we see that the fundamentals that have driven performance in the US, such as ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption and a business model that benefits from tremendous operating leverage generally hold true across international markets. Second, by exporting our successful US model to investment in a diversified portfolio of assets that balance various risk and return profiles, we expect to expand and augment our long-term growth potential. Executing on this thesis has resulted in a footprint that includes diverse and sometimes complicated geographies. In our US markets, as a US business involves creating value, while solving for two types of risk: operational and financial. On the operational front, I can confidently tell you that we have the best operating teams in each geography across our portfolio, and we've overcome operational risks on a consistent basis through our shared global expertise and experience. In many cases, we leverage operating challenges to create new business opportunities and enhance existing or introduce new competitive advantages. This capability has been demonstrated through our reliable speed-to-market delivery on new tower builds, a global reputation of sophisticated regulatory approach that has afforded opportunities to effectively assess new markets and assets and the development of innovative power as a service model that provides best-in-class network uptime and supports initiatives about American Tower, our M&M customers and the communities we serve to deliver clear telecommunications networks. This is one of the key synergies American Tower brings an unmatched global knowledge and support platform to create value through operational excellence. Our investors benefit from our ability to utilize that platform to realize expanded market share of new business, drive best-in-class margins and leverage cost of capital advantages derived from our global balance sheet. When you take all these together, these benefits translate to enhanced value of the assets under the American Tower umbrella commanding a premium relative to the market implied some of the parts on a comparable basis. And where this does not hold true, we've taken corrective actions, which I'll touch on a little bit later. As I mentioned in previous remarks, our exposure to financial risk has been more acute in our emerging market portfolio particularly over the past several years as global macroeconomic factors have had an outsized impact on emerging markets. In these cases, those financial risks have, quite frankly, outpaced what we originally underwrote and together with care consolidation that contributed to financial results in certain emerging markets that fall short of our standards. We're taking action to improve those results. We've talked previously about our focus on cost controls, and I'm happy to say that those are paying off. At the midpoint of our guidance this year, we anticipate savings of over $40 million of SG&A, including bad debt relative to 2023. Our emerging market footprint has been a meaningful contributor to our cost efficiency progress to date, where we're shifting our focus from aggressively growing those portfolios to maximizing the return on our investments. We've also previously commented on raising the hurdle rates for the deployment of additional capital in those markets. These proactive actions and our refined strategic focus have corresponded to an expected 2024 reduction of over 40% in discretionary capital across Latin America, Africa and APAC compared to 2021. Conversely, in parts of our developed market footprint such as Europe and Corsair we're underwriting compelling mid-teens US dollar yields, we're increasing our investments alongside our capital partners. With an expanded developed market platform inclusive of the US and Canada, we've been able to more than double our discretionary capital in those markets over the same period. As a result, as you can see on slide 6, the allocation towards emerging markets has reduced from around two-thirds of our total in 2021 to less than a-third in our 2024 guidance. You'll likely see that number continue to trend down as we satisfy some of our previously contracted obligations in certain markets. Complementing our approach to discretionary capital allocation and supporting our proactive steps to enhance our global portfolio. In 2023, we divested non-core subscale underperforming assets like Mexico fiber and our Poland operations. And earlier this year, we announced our pending exit from India. Additionally, over the past several years, we further expanded our developed market exposure through our M&A focus across the US and Europe, all just name a few examples of the key strategic actions we've taken to date. Pro forma for the anticipated sale of our India business, attributable AFFO exposure to emerging markets will be approximately 25%. As a result of these actions, and those I'll touch on later, we believe our emerging market operations and our business as a whole are in a better position to deliver the higher quality, sustainable earnings growth that makes investing in communications infrastructure is so compelling. However, given the impacts of the financial risk and the stability and the quality of earnings our investor is whitefly demand from tower and communications infrastructure models, we expect to further reduce our relative exposure to emerging markets over time as we continue focus on incremental investments in developed economies. Now, that doesn't mean that you should assume we plan on divesting in particular markets. For our full management team and our Board regularly assess all options, including divestitures and we're going to remain opportunistic as we continue to actively manage our portfolio. We believe today that more long-term value is created by continuing to operate these portfolios, expand our gross margins, and reduce capital intensity, while repatriating cash flows to fund other global priorities such as deleveraging, paying our dividend, developed market investments with the highest quality return profiles, and looking ahead the potential for share buybacks. Meanwhile, continued operation of these portfolios means that we retain the optionality to reinvest into those markets if economic conditions and growth outlooks evolve. With that in mind, here's what we're focused on in our international segment going forward. First, just in the U.S., owning and operating highest quality assets and partner with leading carriers in each market helps provide more stable growth reduce long-term earning volatility resulting from consolidation. This is a critical lesson learned from our experience in India where consolidation post significant headwinds to growth over a multiyear period. Today, the vast majority of our revenues in Europe, Africa, and Latin America come from leading [ph] customers with competitive end market scale. Meaningful enhancements to our counterparty profile over the past several years have come in part due to carrier consolidation, but also as a result of proactively aligning growth initiatives and capital allocation both through development or M&A to our doing business with market leaders, and we remain committed to growing in Tier 1 global MNOs across our footprint. In some cases, particularly where growth capital is not required, we may also support network rollouts of new entrants or smaller operators. However, any time we assess expansion CapEx from carriers that fit this profile, the underwriting standards will be adjusted to account for potential incremental risk on a case-by-case basis. Next, scale is perhaps the most critical component of the international value creation flywheel. At a high level, our scale allows us to operate more profitably by leveraging shared overhead and a global balance sheet that creates cost of capital advantages. Importantly, scale also enables us to develop nationwide agreements that present a differentiated go-to-market solution for leading MNOs that that contract terms we view as critical. In particular, securing full lease-up rights on the assets we acquire, including the ability to monetize by colocation limit activity is crucial to our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Over the past decade, we had counter sale-leaseback opportunities with restrictive contract terms that limit the lease-up monetization. These are non-starters for us. Similarly, while recent currency devaluation in certain markets has exceeded our initial underwriting expectations, CPI-linked escalators have proven to be a critical tool to help mitigate long-term currency risk over the last decade. As we look forward to the balance of 2024 in the next several years, we believe we're uniquely positioned to create differentiated value for our customers. To maximize the benefits of scale portfolio we have in place, we're reinforcing a customer service-driven approach to everything we do. And our internal departments in each region are focused on supporting our sales team's ability to find new business with market leaders and deliver strong organic growth. Further, our global model allows our best-in-class operating team to remain flexible in addressing the ebbs and flows in demand through cross-border share resources, allowing for sustained speed-to-market delivery for our customers, while also supporting focus on cost management. To that end, we remain committed to extending the global efficiency and cost management achievements we made to-date. For 2018 and at the midpoint of our 2024 outlook, we expect to reduce cash SG&A, excluding bad debt as a percentage of revenue by roughly 210 basis points in Europe, Africa and LatAm in aggregate. We're now in the process of further globalizing our business functions to identify additional areas where we can leverage scale and technology to continued growth in customer service in the most cost efficient manner. In closing, we believe we have an opportunity to leverage our learnings for the last two-plus decades of global operations to continue managing and developing a best-in-class business that's capable of delivering high-quality, long-term earnings growth. We're going to continue actively managing our portfolio to ensure compelling mix of geographies and assets that are well positioned to support and monetize growing data demand and our operating capabilities to continue to serve a sustained competitive advantage. As our actions have demonstrated over the past year, we're prepared to make appropriate strategic decisions to ensure that we have a portfolio of the highest quality. Going forward, we believe that through our focus on maximizing organic growth disciplined and flexible reinvestment of cash flows and their growth opportunities and further leveraging our global scale and maximize profitability and returns, we can provide a value proposition that can't be replicated elsewhere, translating into expanded returns on capital over time. With that, I'll hand it over to Rod to discuss Q2 results and our revised outlook.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As highlighted in this morning's press release, we had a strong second quarter driven by the resilient demand for our assets and resulting in robust performance across several key areas. Given the critical nature of our global portfolio and the growth trends in mobile data consumption, we head into the back half of the year confident in our ability to drive strong growth, execute on our cost management initiatives enhance our quality of earnings and deliver compelling total shareholder returns. Before I discuss the specifics of our Q2 results and revised full year outlook, I'll summarize a few of the highlights. First, activity levels on our tower assets remain strong. Our consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% continues to demonstrate the strength of the fundamentals that fuel our business. In our U.S. Services segment performed in line with our expectations for accelerating tower activity in 2024 with revenues and gross profit each increasing over 50% versus Q1 and more than double that of Q4 of 2023. Next, CoreSite executed another exceptionally strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth their second highest quarter of signed new leasing in the company's history and record cash backlog. Additionally, our data center projects currently under development are roughly 60% pre-leased, four times the historical average, providing confidence and visibility to an accelerated pathway to realizing CoreSite's best-in-class returns on invested capital. Furthermore, in India, the positive collection trends we saw over the last several quarters continued in Q2, allowing us to reverse approximately $67 million of previously reserved revenue and clearing the majority of the outstanding AR we have with a key customer. Separately, we made further progress in accelerating certain payments included in the approximately $2.5 billion of potential total proceeds associated with our pending sale of ATC India. In the quarter, we repatriated more than $210 million back to the U.S., and we are in the process of repatriating an additional approximately $20 million, largely associated with the monetization of the VIL OCDs net of fees. To date, total accelerated proceeds stands at approximately $345 million, inclusive of funds received in Q1, and we expect the remaining proceeds potentially of approximately $2.1 billion to be received at closing as we make progress towards closing, which we continue to target the second half of 2024, we anticipate incurring incremental costs within the business between SG&A and maintenance CapEx, a modest offset to the upside realized through strong collections. I will touch on these items and how they impact our outlook later. Finally, we continue to effectively execute on our balance sheet initiatives highlighted in the quarter by the issuance of \u20ac1 billion denominated senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 4%. The proceeds we used to pay down floating rate debt, lowering our ratio back to 89% fixed to 11% floating. Turning to second quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide 8, consolidated property revenue growth was 4.6% or over 6.5%, excluding non-cash straight line revenue, while absorbing roughly 230 basis points of FX headwinds. US and Canada, property revenue growth was approximately 1%, or over 4% excluding straight line and includes an approximately 1% negative impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 7% or over 12%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes an over 8% benefit associated with improved collections in India. Finally, data center revenues increased over 12% as demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues unabated, AI-driven demand picks up in the backlog of record new business signed over the last two years continues to commence. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.3%, supported by strong demand for our assets across our global portfolio. In our US and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and over 6% absent Sprint related churn, we expect a relatively similar growth rate in Q3 before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation of approximately 4.7%. Our International segment drove 5.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting additional moderation in CPI-linked escalators as expected, and a sequential step down in colocation and amendment contributions, most notably in APAC. However, in Europe, we saw another quarter of accelerating new business moving organic tenant billings growth in the region to 5.7% and giving us confidence to modestly raise our full year outlook for the segment, which I'll touch on shortly. Turning to slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.1% or nearly 12%, excluding the impacts of non-cash straight line, while absorbing approximately 210 basis points in FX headwinds, cash, adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 64.7%, which includes a roughly 80 basis point benefit in the quarter associated with India reserve reversals as compared to a drag of nearly 50 basis points in the year ago period. Absent these onetime items, we're continuing to demonstrate meaningful cash margin improvements supported by the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and continued cost management throughout the business. In fact, cash, SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 13.5% and 13.4%, respectively, supported by a high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. Now shifting to our revised full year outlook, I'll start with a few key updates. First, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a strong start to the year. Core performance remains solid, and our continued focus on driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the business is paying off through exceptional conversion rates of top-line results through adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. As you'll see in the next several slides, our core results to-date and expectations for the remainder of year are contributing to outperformance across key metrics for 2024 as compared to our prior expectations. Next, having now come off so consecutive quarters of solid collections in India, we've reassessed expectations for the year. In our prior outlook, we have assumed nearly $50 million in revenue reserves from Q2 to Q4 or just over $16 million per quarter. As I mentioned earlier, through positive collections in Q2, we reversed $67 million of previously reserved revenue translating to an upside $84 million as compared to our prior outlook assumptions for the quarter. We now have confidence to fully remove our previous reserve assumption for the second half of the year, representing an incremental $32 million in upside, which, together with Q2 results is driving an outlook to outlook increase of around $116 million across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO. Finally, we have revised our FX assumptions, providing an incremental headwind of $51 million, $33 million and $28 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO, respectively. Turning to slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million compared to prior outlook. Outperformance includes $116 million associated with positive collection trends in India partially offset by a decrease of $45 million, which consists of a decrease of $58 million in pass-through primarily due to fuel costs, net of an increase of $13 million in straight-line revenue. Consolidated core property revenue remains unchanged with certain offsetting movements between segments. Growth was partially also offset by $51 million associated with negative FX impacts. Moving to slide 11. Expectations for consolidated US and Canada, total international and APAC organic tenant billings growth remain unchanged. However, we have raised expectations for Africa to greater than 12% and Europe to approximately 6%, up from 11% to 12% and 5% to 6%, respectively. In addition, we have lowered our expectations for Latin America to greater than 1.5%, down from approximately 2%. Turning to slide 12. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $130 million as compared to the prior outlook. Outperformance is driven by the flow-through of FX-neutral property revenue upside and direct expense savings partially offset by additional SG&A costs in India and $33 million of FX headwinds. Moving to slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $85 million at the midpoint and $0.18 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.60. Cash, adjusted EBITDA outperformance was partially offset by incremental maintenance CapEx split between the US and Canada, where we're prioritizing certain incremental projects and India. Growth is partially offset by $28 million in FX headwinds. Excluding India, outperformance on an FX-neutral basis was $27 million as compared to prior outlook. Turning to Slide 14. You'll see our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, including unchanged expectations for our 2024 dividend distribution, which is subject to Board approval. On the capital program side, we are increasing our plan for 2024 by $55 million, which includes $30 million associated with maintenance CapEx, as I previously mentioned, and additional success-based development investments in our US data center business to maximize sellable capacity on the back of ongoing record demand. Additionally, we have reallocated certain discretionary capital buckets, including an increase towards our strategically important US land acquisition program, partially offset by savings in redevelopment. Moving to the right side of the slide, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and accelerating our pathway to additional financial flexibility. This commitment is demonstrated through our successful execution in the capital markets including the issuance of over $2 billion in fixed rate debt since the start of the year, a strategic and disciplined approach towards our capital deployment priorities, highlighted for reductions in discretionary capital spend in each of the last several years, together with a rebalancing of strategic priorities between geographies and risk profiles and a continued cost focus across the business. These strategic actions have translated into meaningful progress towards achieving our net leverage target and an improved fixed to floating rate debt profile over the past 24 months. Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we are pleased with our execution through the first half of the year, demonstrating the strength of the fundamentals that underpin our business through solid organic growth and a diligent focus on cost management throughout our company, combined with our prudent approach to capital allocation, while reinforcing and enhancing our balance sheet strength financial flexibility we believe we are well positioned to drive strong sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value while being a best-in-class operation for our stakeholders across the globe. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Steve, thanks for the comments on the international strategy approach. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a update on how you're seeing the opportunities to do additional M&A in the US, Europe, other developed markets? What are you seeing in terms of interesting properties when SBA last night was talking about potential for material deals. Are you seeing the same sort of thing here, how are valuations looking? And then kind of related to that on data centers, you're continuing to invest heavily in that business. You see opportunities for inorganic expansion beyond some of the small tuck-ins you've done either in the US and/or Europe? Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Yes. Thanks, Simon. So with respect to the material M&A in the US and Europe, there are some rumors of portfolios coming available. And so I won't comment on any specific portfolios out there. But what I would reiterate is, we're very focused on our current capital allocation priorities, and in particular, delevering down below 5. Now we did give below 5 this quarter as a result of some of the onetime items, but that will likely go up above 5% next quarter. So we're focused on getting durably below 5. And we're also focused on our internal CapEx programs and the other capital priorities we've laid out there. And at this point, we haven't seen anything that we've evaluated that would take us off those priorities. So there's nothing that we're evaluating today that would be compelling for us today. And just as a reminder, anything that we would buy would need to be better than buying back our own stock. So when we look at those acquisition opportunities, we have to see an opportunity for that 1 plus 1 to equal 3 versus just kind of a growth for growth's sake. So what we're very interested in trying to grow our portfolios in the US and Europe and putting a developed markets that we're in. We aren't seeing opportunities today that look to be the right price, the right asset group for us to see that kind of synergy that would give us that opportunity today. Having said that, our teams are always evaluating everything out there and anything that comes to market, we'll evaluate if that evaluation changes, we'll let you guys know. When it comes to CoreSite, we have a lot of opportunity to invest in our existing campuses, and that's going to give us the best return on the [indiscernible] risk of any CapEx that we can deploy. And just to kind of put a fine point on it, we've got 44 megawatts under construction today and 61% of that is pre-leased. And so there's quite a bit of CapEx going into those campuses today that we feel very confident that we're going to get our mid-teens stabilized yields or better in those campuses that we're investing in. There are some tuck-ins. Miami is one example. And whenever you see us do that, the reason for us to do a tuck-in market like that is to try to build a new campus. We're very committed to our business model. We think it gives us the most resilient asset, the 1 that has the most durability over time and the best returns. And if we can create more campuses and have high interconnection cloud on-ramps in that ecosystem that commands a premium in market, we'll try to develop those. Those take time to develop, and so we do start small. And that's what you're more likely to see with us. Again, we're very committed to our business model being an interconnection hub. And there aren't many inorganic opportunities that would contribute to that model. If something did come available at that profile, we'd look at it. But today, we think we have ample opportunity to invest in that core business that's performing so well for us.\nRod Smith: Simon, good morning, this is Rod. Maybe I'll just add and complement what Steve is saying with a couple of numbers on CapEx for the data center business. So, notwithstanding the fact that our overall CapEx program year-over-year has come down because our capital priorities and the focus on balance sheet strength, delevering all the things Steve talked about. Notwithstanding that decline, we have increased our investments, our CapEx investments in CoreSite for '24 over '23 by roughly 100 million. We did the same '23 over '22. So we are seeing very compelling opportunities. We are following those and leaning in. The numbers in the grand scheme of things are meaningful, albeit modest, but we do have the ability to dynamically allocate that capital. And just because you see our CapEx program go down somewhat. It doesn't mean we're not leaning into the very best opportunities to deploy CapEx.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Very clear. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions. First, I'm just curious if you can unpack a bit more of what you're seeing in the US leasing environment with respect to geography types of activity between densification and amendments? And where A&T may be differiating itself and its results relative to the commentary that we hear from some of your competitors? And then secondly, just curious, your current view on dividend policy exiting 2024 and how that should relate to the level and growth of AFFO per share over time? Thanks.\nSteve Vondran: Sure. Thanks for the question. So in the US, we're seeing 2024 play out much as we expected. We've seen a modest increase in application volume in Q2 over Q1. It is fairly broad-based. The main driver continues to be our carrier customers continuing to build out their 5G network. So it is largely still amendment driven, although we do see an uptick somewhat in new colocations over prior years, I wouldn't point to that as quite a densification phase yet. There's still a lot of room for the carriers to continue to expand their 5G presence. And while we're not getting specific about individual carriers, we would say that over half of our sites are now upgraded with mid-band 5G, but one carrier is ahead of the other two. And we have one that's over 80%, one that's a little over 60% now and one that's a little bit further behind. So there's a lot of runway there for them to continue to roll out mid-band 5G across the portfolio, and we expect them to continue to do that. With respect to our services guide, we are holding our guide for the year. Now there's always a degree of risk in that services guide because it's near term, but what we're seeing in our application flow and our services by is supportive that full year guide. So we do still feel good about the US activity levels kind of hitting those levels that saw at the beginning of the year. I believe the carrier capital spend projections are right in line with that kind of $34 billion to $36 billion is what they've said publicly. And that's again supportive of a level of development that we think is typical in this phase of a build. So we feel good about the US, and we think we're going to continue to see that up-tick. And we're also seeing usage patterns by the consumer continue to drive demand on those networks, and we're seeing the continued drive of that 20% to 30% up-tick in consumer demand that's going to continue to put pressure on the networks. And we're seeing that 5G is working for the carriers. It's letting them produce more gigabytes at lower cost. So we think that, that's going to continue to be a compelling business proposition for them to build 5G and with the addition of fixed wireless and some of the positive trends we're seeing in ARPUs and things like that, we're very confident that the US market will continue to grow and build and that densification phase will come. Sorry, the dividend question.\nRod Smith: Hey, Michael, this is Rod. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding the dividend, as everyone on the call knows, we held our dividend flat in 2024. That was really one of many things that we. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: I retrieve him -- I'm getting him back-up. Please go ahead.\nRod Smith: Great. Thank you. So, I\u2019ll start over Michael. Thank you. This is Rod. So, regarding the dividend, as everyone on the call knows that in 2024, we chose to hold the dividend flat. The reasons behind that really was giving -- given the macroeconomic backdrop, the uncertainty around rates, we decided to favor balance sheet strength, operational growth, organic growth. And it was one of many things that we decided to do as leaned into delevering. We're really focused on driving organic growth. We're focused on expanding margins, controlling direct expenses, focused on actually reducing SG&A, becoming more efficient, reducing costs, and our overall CapEx program and our CapEx investments, holding the dividend flat, and putting the extra funds that we had into delevering and into reducing exposure to floating rate debt in the environment. So, that was one of many things that we did. When you think about going forward into beyond 2024, of course, it's too early to talk about specific guidance for 2025 or beyond. I would remind you and everyone that we're a REIT, we target our dividend distribution to equal about 100% of our pretax income. That's an important point. From a long-term perspective, I would say that we see pre-tax income growing in line with AFFO and AFFO per share growth on average and over time. So, you can think about the trajectory in terms of the growth rate of the dividend being similar to the trajectory the growth rate of AFFO and AFFO per share. That doesn't mean it will match every single year. But over a multiyear period and on average, we believe that will match up pretty well. Certainly, the dividend is a meaningful piece of the overall total shareholder return that we look to deliver. And as always, anything with respect to our dividend and dividend policy needs to be approved by the Board, certainly. So, that's kind of the way we think about it. We would expect that the dividend growth would resume in 2025 based on what we're seeing in the numbers going beyond 2024.\nMichael Rollins: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Morning guys.\nRod Smith: Hey Ric.\nRic Prentiss: A couple of questions on my side. Thanks for the update on the India collections process nicely to get that money on hand and what's left at closing, how should we think about the status of that approval process? And then how long would you get through the competitive committee in India would it take to close the transaction?\nSteve Vondran: At this point, Ric, there's no update on that. We're still waiting for the approval. And what we've said consistently is we believe it is second half of the year closing. So, I'm not sure when that's going to come out. It's hard to predict. But we do still anticipate getting that in that relevant timeframe. And in terms of closing afterwards, I think you could expect that to occur in kind of four to six weeks afterwards, somewhere in that timeframe.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense, probably tie it to a month or a quarter and two just for the accounting purposes, probably.\nRod Smith: Yes. If we have that choice, Ric, we probably would, we'll see exactly how it unfolds.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. Second question, thanks for the update on the mid-band spectrum deployment in the U.S., that's helpful to see kind of at least some over half of the sites and how it kind of varies by carrier. Internationally, any update there with your competitors, peers suggested that obviously, international is way behind those kind of numbers? Any broad stroke as whereas 5G deployment internationally is out?\nSteve Vondran: Sure. I'll give a little bit of color on that. I think it depends on the geography that you're in. If you look at Europe, they've been able to deploy 5G of a large proportion of the population there. I think high 80s, low 90s and Spain and Germany for most part. That's a combination of low and mid-band spectrum to. So there's still a runway of continued opportunity there to get the mid-band deployed there. I don't have specific stats on the percentage of mid-band because it's a little bit more nuanced in that market. And in France, we have OneCare it's a little bit it's a little bit further ahead in terms of 5G than the other. So of a mixed bag there. When you look at Africa, you are seeing some 5G deployments in some of the major cities, but it's still pretty nascent there. They're still focused on their 4G networks, augmenting those and improving the network quality over time. But we do think that you'll see 5G being deployed there, especially where the population centers are over time. So there's still some runway there for those 5G upgrades to occur in Africa. In Latin America, you have a little bit of 5G that's been deployed in Brazil and a couple of the other markets, but most of those markets are a little bit further behind. And even in Brazil, I'd say it's probably nascent in terms of the 5G deployments today. In many of those markets, there's been a delay in getting 5G spectrum in the hands of the carriers. Some of that is auctions that have been delayed, and some of it is the carriers pushing for a lower entry price there. And so I think as we see that play out over time, we'll continue to see opportunity there. The other thing that's happening in Brazil is the incumbents there are still integrating the oil assets they bought and that's depressing the activities there a little bit as they deal with those integrations and combining those networks together. So I'd say it's very consistent with the way we kind of view the international markets that they're a little bit behind the developed markets, the deployment of 5G. We are starting to see some green shoots in some of those markets where they need those cheaper gigabytes that 5G delivers, and we're seeing some deployments there, but there's a lot of runway ahead to deploy it there.\nRic Prentiss: Great. And last one for me. I think on the cost management side, is site decommissioning kind of one of the things that's helping to drive that. It looked like some significant decommissionings in the U.S., Canada, maybe it's related to Sprint towers that are naked once they get off of them, but just maybe a little update on what you're doing with decommissioning towers and how that's benefiting cost and how we should think about running that forward?\nSteve Vondran: Yes. Thanks, Ric. We're looking at everything in terms of cost management. And our goal is to enhance our margin profile by direct cost savings in addition to SG&A. So what you're seeing there is exactly what you would expect. We're looking at that portfolio and where we have underperforming assets that we don't think are going to see near-term activity, we are decommissioning those to save the OpEx on those and doing what's right. So we are doing some accelerated work there. Rob, do you want to touch on some of the other elements.\nRod Smith : Yes. I'll just add in there. In terms of the decommissioning, I think you'll see in the numbers LatAm, we took down about 250 sites in the U.S. We took down about 300. That's just normal portfolio pruning and managing the portfolio from time-to-time. We certainly have sites without tenants on them here and there, and we'll try to lease those up again. And if it doesn't work, we end up taking them down to save the cost. So that is a driver, but it's not the only -- it's not the only driver. We're also seeing lower land rent escalations that was certainly good. We're doing some things with property tax, which resulted in a one-time reduction, which was certainly good. In our CapEx, we're leaning into investing in our brown leases and reducing ground expense. So, that's another area where we're allocating capital to the most accretive and value-creating opportunities. So we're seeing lower land rents based on capital allocation. So there's a number of different things that are playing into that direct cost reduction.\nRick Prentiss: Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.\nRod Smith: Thanks, Ric.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Thanks so much for taking the question. So, you guys made this bold prediction about activity levels and services accelerating through the course of the year. Not everyone, I think, is seeing the same thing, assuming that the service revenue guide is still $195 million, it implies yet another big step-up into the second half on a quarterly basis. But the temptation would then be to extrapolate that as a leading indicator for leasing activity. But as I understand it, the M&A has kind of already contemplated all that. So by the drink model, this activity might foreshadow some increased leasing, but because of the MLAs, you might not see that same kind of sensitivity. So if you could kind of validate that perspective? And then I guess a related question is the holistic MLA that you guys signed with AT&T in September 2019. Theoretically, if it's a 5-year term, it's going to be coming up for renewal or not in the third quarter. You've highlighted that these holistic MLAs typically have far shorter durations than your underlying kind of core MLAs. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, what this means for the business outlook in the second half and into 2025? Thanks.\nSteve Vondran: Sure. Let me start with the services piece of that. So our Q1 services gross margin was about twice what our Q4 2023 was and our Q2 is about 50% up from Q1. So we are seeing acceleration in that services business. And again, we believe from the pipeline that we're looking at today that we're on track to hit our full year services guide on that. And again, there's a risk in that services pipeline, and we've seen it play out a couple of times in the past, but our teams are confident at this point that we're on track to be able to do that. With respect to our MLAs, what we were -- what we've disclosed is that we had one customer that rolled off the MLA earlier this year. And so we haven't really talked specifically about anything beyond that. But because we've telegraphed that pretty clearly, I think you can get an idea that that's where we kind of where we are. Those comprehensive portions are typically 3 to 5 years, so it's not just 5 years. There's a different range on those. And since we do have 1 customer that's off of that kind of use-right fee that underpins that smoothing out of growth over time, that customer is a little bit more dependent on the volumes that they're doing. And so there will be a little bit more peaks and valleys in terms of activity with them. The works on instant we're fine either way on that. We take a long-term view of these agreements. And if getting into another holistic type of agreement makes sense, we will. And if we don't think it does, we'll stay and pay up the drink, and we're very confident in our ability to monetize that way. With respect the activity and how that translates into our organic growth over time, it's too early to be giving kind of a 2025 guide at this point. We'll do that in February, like we always do. But we are encouraged by the growth that we see in terms of the activity by the carriers. We do have one major customer who is off the holistic portion of their agreement. They still have underling MLA, but the holistic portion is expired. And so if those volumes continue, that's a positive. We also have what we call our vertical market segment, which are smaller customers, and that's also very much dependent on volume and timing on that. And we're seeing good activity there as well. So we're encouraged by that. When we look out into the future, we do have a level of contractually locked in growth for 2025 via our comprehensive MLA and that's similar to what we see in 2024 as well as consistent growth from the escalator of about 3%. On the churn side, in 2025, we're going to continue to see a level of elevated spread churn. The final tranche of that spread churn commenced in Q4 of this year, that's about $70 million of annualized monthly run rate. That will impact our growth rates through Q3 of next year. In terms of kind of the swing factors that you would see in terms of 2025, there's a portion the growth that's not locked in via the conference of MLAs. Again, I mentioned one of the big three carriers and the vertical markets. So that's a swing factor. We also have our eye on the timing and scale of any potential churn from US cellular. Over the next couple of years in the event that deal is approved and closes. We'd expect the overlap to be modest, but the timing and the scale of that churn could put some pressure on rates temporarily. And who knows, we could end up signing another conference of MLA or agreement that would also potentially impact what that number looks like. So there's a number of swing factors for 2025, and that's why we can't really give guidance until we get to February. But at the end of day, we're still confident that we're going to have continued growth supportive of our longer-term guide.\nDavid Barden: Thanks, Steve. Very helpful. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. One question, one follow-up. First, Steve, you spoke a little bit about emerging markets making up roughly 25% of AFFO per share today. Where do you see that going over time? And how does that inform forward uses of discretionary capital in your M&A strategy? And then just a follow-up maybe for Rod. If you can quantify the benefit to property taxes that you saw in the quarter and just clarify if it's onetime in nature or not? Thank you.\nSteve Vondran: Thanks for the question. Let me just clarify, the 25% is pro forma for the India transaction. So a little bit higher today. Once we close the new transaction, we'll be at roughly 25%. And as we look at some of the macroeconomic conditions, particularly the FX headwinds that we've been seeing, that's kind of given us the choice to start pivoting a little bit more away from the exposure into those emerging market economies, given what we're seeing in the macroeconomic conditions today. So what we're doing is pivoting more of our discretionary CapEx to the developed markets. This isn't a new thing. We've been doing that for the last several years, and we haven't done an emerging market transaction in quite a few years now. And the bulk of our CapEx has been going toward developed markets. What that will do if that trend continues, and we expect it to, is it will reduce that emerging market exposure over time. We're not setting a kind of line in the sand a day for where we think it should be, but we do think it appropriate to work that percentage down over time by focusing on our developed markets. Having said that, we will continue to support our Tier 1 MNOs in those markets. We'll make some discretionary CapEx investments where it makes sense or where they meet the return criteria that we set out for markets. But in terms of expanding in those markets are looking to double down or anything. That's not something you're likely to see us do given our desire to reduce the exposure we have to that -- those emerging market economies.\nRod Smith: Hey, Matt, Rod here. So on one of the charts, you can see on the adjusted EBITDA, we're showing roughly a $50 million benefit to outlook on cash gross margins. The way to think about that is much of that is driven, almost all of that is driven by benefits or improvements in that direct expense line. From a high level, think about it as 50/50 mix in terms of what may be run rate and what may be one-time in nature. And then when you think about that, roughly one-quarter of the entire piece was a property tax accrual. But there's a lot of other kind of nits and nats and things going through that section there. Things like the accelerated e-com as we just talked about with the record of the land purchases as well as just some operational improvements around the way we do R&M and contractor management and other things. So roughly the $49 million of improvement in cash gross margin, think of it 50/50 as onetime versus durable and reoccurring going forward. And property tax onetime benefit was roughly one-quarter of the whole thing.\nMatt Niknam: Awesome. Thank you.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, you delivered a relatively concise message on the strategy for international markets and emerging markets, in particular, and the higher hurdle rates for organic investment. Can you maybe just comment on, broadly speaking, whether you'll be more likely to dispose of some of those non-core emerging market assets if they were able to fetch higher multiples in the market? And then secondly, you also delivered a pretty clear theme around the higher returns and portfolio optimization. Can you maybe quantify for us, what are your consolidated returns inhibitions are where they are where they relative to where they stand today?\nSteve Vondran: Sure. I'll hit the first part of that, Rod can hit the second. We always are looking to actively manage our portfolio. So the management team and the Board regularly review our portfolio and look at the assets under our management. And we're always looking to say, what's going to create the best long-term shareholder value. And so when you think about some of the benefits that American Tower brings to these portfolios, I touched on this a little bit in my prepared remarks, but I'll reiterate it. We have operational excellence across the globe, and that operational excellence lets us drive best-in-class margins. It lets us optimize the amount of new business we get, so organic growth is better under American Tower. And so we believe that we create a lot more value for those assets that are under our umbrella than anybody else can. Now where that doesn't hold true if we think that somebody else can create more value, we would look at divesting it, and that's what we do with India. So absolutely, price is one of the considerations that would factor in when we think about whether a disposition create more value than we continue to operate it. But at this point, we think the best thing that we can do is keep those assets under our umbrella, continue to operate them in the way that we do and continue to focus on the gross margin and the growth of the organic revenue there. And if we ever do decide that a disposition is more desirable at that point, it's going to be more valuable because we've created more cash flow on the assets. So right now, that's where our decision point is. But we'll always be nimble and we'll always look to maximize the long-term value. Now there are some subscale portfolios and some ancillary businesses that we would think about. If you look at what we've done over the past couple of years, we did divest Mexico fiber. We did divest Poland, one because it was subscale, the other because we thought somebody else could maximize that business better. And so when you look at some of those portfolios in our overall portfolio, that's the type of thing that we think about. But there's no process we've announced today and nothing I would point to of any scale that we think would make sense in the short-term.\nRod Smith: Hey Jim, Rod here. I'll just hit on your return on invested capital question. So, one thing I would point out right at the start here is we do give in the disclosures, A, the NOI yield in U.S. dollar terms for vintage. So, I think you've probably seen that, but dig into that, there's a lot of interesting information in there. One thing I would point out is that the NOI yields in U.S. dollar terms typically are higher than the U.S. when you're looking at these emerging markets. So, for build-to-suits and other investments, that's been that's been the case. And they need to be because we, as Steve talked about, have risk-adjusted return requirements, of course, not just per region, but by country and even deal-specific. So, we do require an additional spread a risk-adjusted spread. Sometimes even over and above the detailed country level cost of capital that we calculate will require a spread over that, that that could be meaningful to compensate for other things that we see either in the market or in the portfolio. So, that certainly is key. But when you look at analysis, you'll see that the vintage analysis shows that the NOI yields over time go up. Certainly, when you think about the emerging markets, we're looking at low teens here and heading upwards, we would expect them all to be in the upper teens certainly in places like Africa, above 20% over time, would certainly be where we would target that. So, broadly speaking, you've heard us say it before, but when you think about Africa, we're looking for high teens, north of 20% returns. And then depending on the country, it can even be higher at the high end of that and even higher. Today, we're below that. But if you look at our return on invested capital across the region as reported, we're in the mid-teens for return on invested capital. But these are long-term assets. So, our focus on driving organic growth, margin expansion really driving SG&A costs being super-efficient when it comes to the way we operate the markets, including Africa, but LatAm even India while we have it. And combining that, coupling that with very disciplined CapEx programs, maybe even lower CapEx programs are all meant to drive return on invested capital up for us so that we can reach our hurdle rate and get beyond it. And again, these are long-term assets. And LatAm is maybe a little better of a position, but similar. They're at the low teens from a return on invested capital. The requirements there are going to be more in the mid-teens, not necessarily north of 20%. So, you may recall, we've done a fair amount of building and acquiring there over the last several years. So, again, the focus on operational execution and excellence in these markets, we really talk about that. We plan that, and we drive that in the business to help accelerate these returns on invested capital over the long-term. But these are long-term assets, and we're very bullish on the underlying fundamentals of the business, not just in the U.S., Europe, and CoreSite in course, but the fundamentals underpinning the operating results across LatAm and Africa are very good. In Europe, we're actually seeing an acceleration in new business contributions in organic tenant billings 2024 or 2023. So, that is certainly a very positive sign. Hopefully, that addresses the question, Jim.\nJim Schneider: Yes, thank you.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the data center segment with CoreSite. You mentioned you had your second highest bookings quarter this quarter. So could you talk about what the demand backdrop looks like there? Is it -- do you see more larger footprint opportunities tied to either cloud or AI or is your performance more related to kind of traditional enterprise workloads?\nSteve Vondran: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll address demand and then I'll address who we're leasing to a separate issues. We're seeing broad-based demand from a lot of different sectors. Part of that, there's a scarcity of supply in some of the markets that we're in. But our key customer base that's driving long-term demand in CoreSite continues to be enterprises that are deploying hybrid cloud deployment, hybrid cloud technology. And we see a very long tail of that business. And it's probably helpful for me to talk a little bit about how we curate our customer mix. CoreSite doesn't just lease to just anybody who wants to lease space in their facilities, particularly when we're looking at our scale and hyperscale space that's available, we want to lease to customers that help build the ecosystem. And that's why we are pretty selective in terms of who we lease to. And so that hybrid cloud deployment is the perfect type of customer to help build that ecosystem. We are seeing demand from AI, and the inferencing layer of AI is perfectly suited for our highly interconnected ecosystem like CoreSite because it helps distribute the content that the AI is generating. And so we do see some demand there. We're being selective in terms of who we're willing to lease to in that. We do recognize that not all customers are kind of built the same in that space. So we want to make sure that we're partnering with people who have good long-term business plans there. But what's driving the overall demand is just a general scarcity of supply there, but we're continuing to lease to that core customer base, expanding our enterprise reach for hyper cloud deployments, a little bit of AI and then continuing to serve a lot of the customers that we already have there as they expand their needs. And those are the primary drivers from who we're leasing to you.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks, Steven. Just one follow-up for Rod. You touched on the deleveraging path and the potential for buybacks. As we look into 2025, any kind of early reason how -- what key variables you may look at when the in that decision, whether it's AFFO yields versus implied cost of capital or any other variables to keep in mind and when the buyback conversation may become a little more tangible.\nRod Smith: Yeah, it's a good question, Eric. I would say, first off, we -- you saw in the numbers, we're at about 4.8 times levered. Our stated range is 3 times to 5 times. So we're below that. We're also at about 5 times at the end of Q1. Leverage for Q1 and Q2 were materially supported or helped by some onetime nonrecurring benefits. With that said, and Steve alluded to this earlier, we do expect leverage to tick back up to 5.0 or 5.1 during Q3 and Q4. We'll see where that goes. But we're very, very confident that we are on the right path, driving towards getting to that 5.0 and we will get there. Most likely the second half of this year, if not the beginning of next year. So with that, we do feel as though we'll be in a position to have financial flexibility and kind of manage the business without a hyperfocus on the delevering. And with that said, we'll be very disciplined. We'll be looking at all of our capital allocation options, including our CapEx programs, not in general, but specifically country by country, deal by deal, asset by asset. And there's some compelling things that we can invest our capital in as Steve outlined in his kind of strategic prepared remarks and in some of the Q&A. So the CapEx programs are still very much supportive of long-term total shareholder returns. So that's an opportunity. When it comes to buybacks, the buybacks, it has to create more shareholder value over the long term than deploying it towards CapEx or an M&A program or delevering. There are simple ways to look at it in terms of just you buyback a share stock as the yield above or below the cost of debt, we'll certainly be looking at that. But longer-term growth rates are really important, too, on our own business as well as where we invest, we'll be looking at the returns beyond day one as well. But rest assured, we will be doing a lot of work being very opportunistic and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation across the board and buying back shares will be one of options that that we have in our toolkit we'll be continuing to evaluate.\nEric Luebchow: Thanks guys.\nRod Smith: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from Moffitt Matheson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, going back to CoreSite. Yeah, I think you're planning your first aggregation edge data center in Raleigh. And I also saw a footnote that you're launching a JV with Stonepeak in Denver. So I guess, can you talk about what you're hoping to achieve with those projects, the rationale for the deal structure in Denver and whether we should expect more projects like these in the coming years?\nSteve Vondran: Sure. Those are two very different projects. So I'll start with the Raleigh. So the Raleigh data center is really being done by our US tower division, working with CoreSite. And that is our continued evolution as we work with various partners on the edge, we needed a little bit more of a sandbox for them to play in. And Raleigh was a good market. It has low power costs. There's a lot of enterprise there that are working on edge applications. And so we think it's a good place for us to kind of start there, and we are seeing demand in that market that we think we can serve there. That one is expandable. It's on a tower site, so we were able to get easy access to land, there's power, there's fiber. It was just a great location for us. And so we'll see how that plays out over time. Again, that's part of our experimentation on the edge, and we do have some clear visibility into monetizing that as well. So that's a benefit of having sandbox that makes money. The second one, DE3. So this is a little bit different. This is our first purpose-built data center in Denver. And while we do have a small presence in Denver, it's not really a campus effect yet. And what we've said over time is we're open to structures where we're a minority partner where it gives us the ability to build a campus over time. So for that particular facility, we're taking advantage of the opportunity that we have to meet the demand for a strategic customer to support the ecosystem in Denver, and we're utilizing our partnership and the capital flexibility that that we have with that partnership to not redirect any of our current cash flow -- our current CapEx program to that and our partner is happy to fund that development. And the reason we're doing that is to really start building that campus in in Denver and to do it a capital-efficient way for us. And so we think that's the right structure for that facility. That parcel is large enough to build other buildings. We have retained ownership of those other buildings in CoreSite. And so if we build future pieces of the campus, that would likely be done in CoreSite. And we do have the ability to buy back the one that's being built there, if we decide that that's the right thing to do as we build an ecosystem over time. And that structure today is -- it's very similar to what you're seeing other data centers do with private capital partners. CoreSite's going to own 15%, Stone People own 85% as we developed that first facility there in Denver.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That's great. Thanks for the detail, Steve. Second, kind of turning back to emerging markets towers. In your prepared remarks, you said that scale is the most critical driver of value creation overseas. I guess, how do you define and measure scale? Is it just a given number of towers? Is it share of towers? Is it exposure to top carriers when you look at scale by region versus country? Just interested in any each on that front so you can better understand kind of what you're looking for?\nSteve Vondran : Sure. Look, at a high level, you want to be the number one or number two independent tower company in a market, if you can. That's your ideal situation to be in. At a broad level, scale means being strategically relevant to your customers. So you could have some localized scale without having national scale as long you're relevant enough to have some leverage in the negotiations with the customers there. And so that's really how we think about scale. We have some markets where we're subscale, but we're able to leverage regional scale in those by using operating leverage. And what I mean by that is we can serve some of those under scale markets with the human capital we have in other parts of those markets. So we might operate a small country from a larger country that's nearby. And that's how we're getting some operational scale. It helps us get even better returns in there that you really would naturally get in a subscale market. But at the end of the day, we want to be kind of the number one or two in the market in terms of independence, captives are a little bit different because they have different dynamics with it. But that's how we think about it overall. And we do have -- like if you look at Latin America, about 97% of our sites are in markets where we're the leader. In Africa, it's well over half of the sites that we're the market leader in. A little bit lower in Europe today. But overall, we felt we have adequate scale in all those markets to be strategically relevant to the customers and to get the cost synergies that you get.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That's great. Thanks Steve.\nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi : Great. Thank you. Comprehensive MLAs have helped provide visibility for domestic growth. Can you talk about if you're also seeing opportunities to implement the same strategy internationally? And could that change the growth trajectory? I also wanted to follow up on AFFO growth with solid revenue growth and good cost control. If you just put FX and fluctuations in rates of side, do you think that we're back on a trend for high single-digit FFO growth for the next few years? Thank you.\nSteve Vondran : Sure, I'll take the further part about the MLAs and Rod can touch on the growth. The conference of MLAs that we have in the U.S. are pretty much uniquely in the U.S. right now. We've talked to partners internationally about those contract structures and there's some interest in learning more about them. But because the -- they haven't been using those markets before, there's some understandable concern on the counterparty side, about being the first one to take the leap into that. So we've encouraged them to talk to our U.S. customers to understand the benefits of that. So I'm hopeful that we can export those because, again, those create value for both parties. It gives us predictability on the revenue side. It gives customers predictability on their cost side. It vastly simplifies the deployment of networks by the customers. So I'm hopeful that our international customers will embrace that, and we'll continue talking with them about it until they do, but none to announce right now, Batya.\nBatya Levi: Got it.\nRod Smith: Hey, Batya, Rod here. I'll take the AFFO piece. So I'll start off by saying we believe in the fundamentals of the portfolio that we've built around the globe. Certainly, when you think about our ability to drive AFFO per share growth, it really starts with revenue growth. So I could give you a very short answer to your question. I'll give you the medium answer here. So the way we think about the bits and pieces that support and drive AFFO per share growth. Certainly in the US, we're continuing to see demand and activity levels that are in line with our previous long-term guide on OTBG, organic tenant billings growth in and around that 5%. You've heard us say we continue to see demand for our emerging markets. And in Europe, we're seeing escalating new business growth, which is really good. That's all very supportive over the long-term for the international towers that we have to deliver higher organic tenant billings growth than the US does by maybe a couple hundred basis points. That is certainly kind of front and center. CoreSite, as you heard from Steve and you see in our numbers and you have for several quarters is outperforming our expectations, and very accretive to overall growth rates, and that's been really nice to see. And we continue to build sites very opportunistically and disciplined, maybe not as many as we used to, but we build sites that adds to growth rate in revenue. So you put all that together and you're in the upper single digits in terms of revenue growth, call it 6% or 7%, somewhere in that range. And then we're focused on margin expansion, controlling the direct cost driving margins up. That means you get into that range around the gross margin point. SG&A, this year, loan SG&A is going down $30 million year-over-year decline last year as well. So SG&A cost control is also supportive and accretive to those growth rates. So when you think about all the things that we've done and everything that we see, the fundamentals in this business for our towers globally is really strong and could potentially deliver upper single-digit AFFO growth on the towers around the globe. Now the things that you do need to watch, we certainly watch and pay a lot of attention to, some of these are not under our control, of course, interest rates could go up or down, that could be positive or negative from time-to-time. FX, same thing could go up, could go down, it could be positive, could be negative. And then in particular, very specifically, we have the ATC India sale, which we are very confident will close out during the second half of this year just like we previously guided. That will be slightly dilutive, maybe about $0.08 to $0.09 on a per quarter basis. So if we close it early in October, you might see $0.08 or $0.09 dilution from that. And then you'll see the follow-on kind of tail of that into next year. But absent interest rates or assuming interest rates are flat, FX is flat and eliminating the ATC India, we have a portfolio of assets here that are performing very well operationally with the fundamentals that could deliver upper single-digit AFFO per share growth.\nBatya Levi: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nRod Smith: Welcome.\nAdam Smith: All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions. Thanks again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rod Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As highlighted in this morning's press release, we had a strong second quarter driven by the resilient demand for our assets and resulting in robust performance across several key areas. Given the critical nature of our global portfolio and the growth trends in mobile data consumption, we head into the back half of the year confident in our ability to drive strong growth, execute on our cost management initiatives enhance our quality of earnings and deliver compelling total shareholder returns. Before I discuss the specifics of our Q2 results and revised full year outlook, I'll summarize a few of the highlights. First, activity levels on our tower assets remain strong. Our consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% continues to demonstrate the strength of the fundamentals that fuel our business. In our U.S. Services segment performed in line with our expectations for accelerating tower activity in 2024 with revenues and gross profit each increasing over 50% versus Q1 and more than double that of Q4 of 2023. Next, CoreSite executed another exceptionally strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth their second highest quarter of signed new leasing in the company's history and record cash backlog. Additionally, our data center projects currently under development are roughly 60% pre-leased, four times the historical average, providing confidence and visibility to an accelerated pathway to realizing CoreSite's best-in-class returns on invested capital. Furthermore, in India, the positive collection trends we saw over the last several quarters continued in Q2, allowing us to reverse approximately $67 million of previously reserved revenue and clearing the majority of the outstanding AR we have with a key customer. Separately, we made further progress in accelerating certain payments included in the approximately $2.5 billion of potential total proceeds associated with our pending sale of ATC India. In the quarter, we repatriated more than $210 million back to the U.S., and we are in the process of repatriating an additional approximately $20 million, largely associated with the monetization of the VIL OCDs net of fees. To date, total accelerated proceeds stands at approximately $345 million, inclusive of funds received in Q1, and we expect the remaining proceeds potentially of approximately $2.1 billion to be received at closing as we make progress towards closing, which we continue to target the second half of 2024, we anticipate incurring incremental costs within the business between SG&A and maintenance CapEx, a modest offset to the upside realized through strong collections. I will touch on these items and how they impact our outlook later. Finally, we continue to effectively execute on our balance sheet initiatives highlighted in the quarter by the issuance of \u20ac1 billion denominated senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 4%. The proceeds we used to pay down floating rate debt, lowering our ratio back to 89% fixed to 11% floating. Turning to second quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide 8, consolidated property revenue growth was 4.6% or over 6.5%, excluding non-cash straight line revenue, while absorbing roughly 230 basis points of FX headwinds. US and Canada, property revenue growth was approximately 1%, or over 4% excluding straight line and includes an approximately 1% negative impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 7% or over 12%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes an over 8% benefit associated with improved collections in India. Finally, data center revenues increased over 12% as demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues unabated, AI-driven demand picks up in the backlog of record new business signed over the last two years continues to commence. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.3%, supported by strong demand for our assets across our global portfolio. In our US and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and over 6% absent Sprint related churn, we expect a relatively similar growth rate in Q3 before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation of approximately 4.7%. Our International segment drove 5.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting additional moderation in CPI-linked escalators as expected, and a sequential step down in colocation and amendment contributions, most notably in APAC. However, in Europe, we saw another quarter of accelerating new business moving organic tenant billings growth in the region to 5.7% and giving us confidence to modestly raise our full year outlook for the segment, which I'll touch on shortly. Turning to slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.1% or nearly 12%, excluding the impacts of non-cash straight line, while absorbing approximately 210 basis points in FX headwinds, cash, adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 64.7%, which includes a roughly 80 basis point benefit in the quarter associated with India reserve reversals as compared to a drag of nearly 50 basis points in the year ago period. Absent these onetime items, we're continuing to demonstrate meaningful cash margin improvements supported by the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and continued cost management throughout the business. In fact, cash, SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 13.5% and 13.4%, respectively, supported by a high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. Now shifting to our revised full year outlook, I'll start with a few key updates. First, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a strong start to the year. Core performance remains solid, and our continued focus on driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the business is paying off through exceptional conversion rates of top-line results through adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. As you'll see in the next several slides, our core results to-date and expectations for the remainder of year are contributing to outperformance across key metrics for 2024 as compared to our prior expectations. Next, having now come off so consecutive quarters of solid collections in India, we've reassessed expectations for the year. In our prior outlook, we have assumed nearly $50 million in revenue reserves from Q2 to Q4 or just over $16 million per quarter. As I mentioned earlier, through positive collections in Q2, we reversed $67 million of previously reserved revenue translating to an upside $84 million as compared to our prior outlook assumptions for the quarter. We now have confidence to fully remove our previous reserve assumption for the second half of the year, representing an incremental $32 million in upside, which, together with Q2 results is driving an outlook to outlook increase of around $116 million across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO. Finally, we have revised our FX assumptions, providing an incremental headwind of $51 million, $33 million and $28 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO, respectively. Turning to slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million compared to prior outlook. Outperformance includes $116 million associated with positive collection trends in India partially offset by a decrease of $45 million, which consists of a decrease of $58 million in pass-through primarily due to fuel costs, net of an increase of $13 million in straight-line revenue. Consolidated core property revenue remains unchanged with certain offsetting movements between segments. Growth was partially also offset by $51 million associated with negative FX impacts. Moving to slide 11. Expectations for consolidated US and Canada, total international and APAC organic tenant billings growth remain unchanged. However, we have raised expectations for Africa to greater than 12% and Europe to approximately 6%, up from 11% to 12% and 5% to 6%, respectively. In addition, we have lowered our expectations for Latin America to greater than 1.5%, down from approximately 2%. Turning to slide 12. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $130 million as compared to the prior outlook. Outperformance is driven by the flow-through of FX-neutral property revenue upside and direct expense savings partially offset by additional SG&A costs in India and $33 million of FX headwinds. Moving to slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $85 million at the midpoint and $0.18 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.60. Cash, adjusted EBITDA outperformance was partially offset by incremental maintenance CapEx split between the US and Canada, where we're prioritizing certain incremental projects and India. Growth is partially offset by $28 million in FX headwinds. Excluding India, outperformance on an FX-neutral basis was $27 million as compared to prior outlook. Turning to Slide 14. You'll see our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, including unchanged expectations for our 2024 dividend distribution, which is subject to Board approval. On the capital program side, we are increasing our plan for 2024 by $55 million, which includes $30 million associated with maintenance CapEx, as I previously mentioned, and additional success-based development investments in our US data center business to maximize sellable capacity on the back of ongoing record demand. Additionally, we have reallocated certain discretionary capital buckets, including an increase towards our strategically important US land acquisition program, partially offset by savings in redevelopment. Moving to the right side of the slide, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and accelerating our pathway to additional financial flexibility. This commitment is demonstrated through our successful execution in the capital markets including the issuance of over $2 billion in fixed rate debt since the start of the year, a strategic and disciplined approach towards our capital deployment priorities, highlighted for reductions in discretionary capital spend in each of the last several years, together with a rebalancing of strategic priorities between geographies and risk profiles and a continued cost focus across the business. These strategic actions have translated into meaningful progress towards achieving our net leverage target and an improved fixed to floating rate debt profile over the past 24 months. Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we are pleased with our execution through the first half of the year, demonstrating the strength of the fundamentals that underpin our business through solid organic growth and a diligent focus on cost management throughout our company, combined with our prudent approach to capital allocation, while reinforcing and enhancing our balance sheet strength financial flexibility we believe we are well positioned to drive strong sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value while being a best-in-class operation for our stakeholders across the globe. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Simon, good morning, this is Rod. Maybe I'll just add and complement what Steve is saying with a couple of numbers on CapEx for the data center business. So, notwithstanding the fact that our overall CapEx program year-over-year has come down because our capital priorities and the focus on balance sheet strength, delevering all the things Steve talked about. Notwithstanding that decline, we have increased our investments, our CapEx investments in CoreSite for '24 over '23 by roughly 100 million. We did the same '23 over '22. So we are seeing very compelling opportunities. We are following those and leaning in. The numbers in the grand scheme of things are meaningful, albeit modest, but we do have the ability to dynamically allocate that capital. And just because you see our CapEx program go down somewhat. It doesn't mean we're not leaning into the very best opportunities to deploy CapEx. Hey, Michael, this is Rod. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding the dividend, as everyone on the call knows, we held our dividend flat in 2024. That was really one of many things that we. [Technical Difficulty] Great. Thank you. So, I\u2019ll start over Michael. Thank you. This is Rod. So, regarding the dividend, as everyone on the call knows that in 2024, we chose to hold the dividend flat. The reasons behind that really was giving -- given the macroeconomic backdrop, the uncertainty around rates, we decided to favor balance sheet strength, operational growth, organic growth. And it was one of many things that we decided to do as leaned into delevering. We're really focused on driving organic growth. We're focused on expanding margins, controlling direct expenses, focused on actually reducing SG&A, becoming more efficient, reducing costs, and our overall CapEx program and our CapEx investments, holding the dividend flat, and putting the extra funds that we had into delevering and into reducing exposure to floating rate debt in the environment. So, that was one of many things that we did. When you think about going forward into beyond 2024, of course, it's too early to talk about specific guidance for 2025 or beyond. I would remind you and everyone that we're a REIT, we target our dividend distribution to equal about 100% of our pretax income. That's an important point. From a long-term perspective, I would say that we see pre-tax income growing in line with AFFO and AFFO per share growth on average and over time. So, you can think about the trajectory in terms of the growth rate of the dividend being similar to the trajectory the growth rate of AFFO and AFFO per share. That doesn't mean it will match every single year. But over a multiyear period and on average, we believe that will match up pretty well. Certainly, the dividend is a meaningful piece of the overall total shareholder return that we look to deliver. And as always, anything with respect to our dividend and dividend policy needs to be approved by the Board, certainly. So, that's kind of the way we think about it. We would expect that the dividend growth would resume in 2025 based on what we're seeing in the numbers going beyond 2024. You're welcome. Hey Ric. Yes. If we have that choice, Ric, we probably would, we'll see exactly how it unfolds. Yes. I'll just add in there. In terms of the decommissioning, I think you'll see in the numbers LatAm, we took down about 250 sites in the U.S. We took down about 300. That's just normal portfolio pruning and managing the portfolio from time-to-time. We certainly have sites without tenants on them here and there, and we'll try to lease those up again. And if it doesn't work, we end up taking them down to save the cost. So that is a driver, but it's not the only -- it's not the only driver. We're also seeing lower land rent escalations that was certainly good. We're doing some things with property tax, which resulted in a one-time reduction, which was certainly good. In our CapEx, we're leaning into investing in our brown leases and reducing ground expense. So, that's another area where we're allocating capital to the most accretive and value-creating opportunities. So we're seeing lower land rents based on capital allocation. So there's a number of different things that are playing into that direct cost reduction. Thanks, Ric. Hey, Matt, Rod here. So on one of the charts, you can see on the adjusted EBITDA, we're showing roughly a $50 million benefit to outlook on cash gross margins. The way to think about that is much of that is driven, almost all of that is driven by benefits or improvements in that direct expense line. From a high level, think about it as 50/50 mix in terms of what may be run rate and what may be one-time in nature. And then when you think about that, roughly one-quarter of the entire piece was a property tax accrual. But there's a lot of other kind of nits and nats and things going through that section there. Things like the accelerated e-com as we just talked about with the record of the land purchases as well as just some operational improvements around the way we do R&M and contractor management and other things. So roughly the $49 million of improvement in cash gross margin, think of it 50/50 as onetime versus durable and reoccurring going forward. And property tax onetime benefit was roughly one-quarter of the whole thing. You're welcome. Hey Jim, Rod here. I'll just hit on your return on invested capital question. So, one thing I would point out right at the start here is we do give in the disclosures, A, the NOI yield in U.S. dollar terms for vintage. So, I think you've probably seen that, but dig into that, there's a lot of interesting information in there. One thing I would point out is that the NOI yields in U.S. dollar terms typically are higher than the U.S. when you're looking at these emerging markets. So, for build-to-suits and other investments, that's been that's been the case. And they need to be because we, as Steve talked about, have risk-adjusted return requirements, of course, not just per region, but by country and even deal-specific. So, we do require an additional spread a risk-adjusted spread. Sometimes even over and above the detailed country level cost of capital that we calculate will require a spread over that, that that could be meaningful to compensate for other things that we see either in the market or in the portfolio. So, that certainly is key. But when you look at analysis, you'll see that the vintage analysis shows that the NOI yields over time go up. Certainly, when you think about the emerging markets, we're looking at low teens here and heading upwards, we would expect them all to be in the upper teens certainly in places like Africa, above 20% over time, would certainly be where we would target that. So, broadly speaking, you've heard us say it before, but when you think about Africa, we're looking for high teens, north of 20% returns. And then depending on the country, it can even be higher at the high end of that and even higher. Today, we're below that. But if you look at our return on invested capital across the region as reported, we're in the mid-teens for return on invested capital. But these are long-term assets. So, our focus on driving organic growth, margin expansion really driving SG&A costs being super-efficient when it comes to the way we operate the markets, including Africa, but LatAm even India while we have it. And combining that, coupling that with very disciplined CapEx programs, maybe even lower CapEx programs are all meant to drive return on invested capital up for us so that we can reach our hurdle rate and get beyond it. And again, these are long-term assets. And LatAm is maybe a little better of a position, but similar. They're at the low teens from a return on invested capital. The requirements there are going to be more in the mid-teens, not necessarily north of 20%. So, you may recall, we've done a fair amount of building and acquiring there over the last several years. So, again, the focus on operational execution and excellence in these markets, we really talk about that. We plan that, and we drive that in the business to help accelerate these returns on invested capital over the long-term. But these are long-term assets, and we're very bullish on the underlying fundamentals of the business, not just in the U.S., Europe, and CoreSite in course, but the fundamentals underpinning the operating results across LatAm and Africa are very good. In Europe, we're actually seeing an acceleration in new business contributions in organic tenant billings 2024 or 2023. So, that is certainly a very positive sign. Hopefully, that addresses the question, Jim. You're welcome. Yeah, it's a good question, Eric. I would say, first off, we -- you saw in the numbers, we're at about 4.8 times levered. Our stated range is 3 times to 5 times. So we're below that. We're also at about 5 times at the end of Q1. Leverage for Q1 and Q2 were materially supported or helped by some onetime nonrecurring benefits. With that said, and Steve alluded to this earlier, we do expect leverage to tick back up to 5.0 or 5.1 during Q3 and Q4. We'll see where that goes. But we're very, very confident that we are on the right path, driving towards getting to that 5.0 and we will get there. Most likely the second half of this year, if not the beginning of next year. So with that, we do feel as though we'll be in a position to have financial flexibility and kind of manage the business without a hyperfocus on the delevering. And with that said, we'll be very disciplined. We'll be looking at all of our capital allocation options, including our CapEx programs, not in general, but specifically country by country, deal by deal, asset by asset. And there's some compelling things that we can invest our capital in as Steve outlined in his kind of strategic prepared remarks and in some of the Q&A. So the CapEx programs are still very much supportive of long-term total shareholder returns. So that's an opportunity. When it comes to buybacks, the buybacks, it has to create more shareholder value over the long term than deploying it towards CapEx or an M&A program or delevering. There are simple ways to look at it in terms of just you buyback a share stock as the yield above or below the cost of debt, we'll certainly be looking at that. But longer-term growth rates are really important, too, on our own business as well as where we invest, we'll be looking at the returns beyond day one as well. But rest assured, we will be doing a lot of work being very opportunistic and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation across the board and buying back shares will be one of options that that we have in our toolkit we'll be continuing to evaluate. You're welcome. Hey, Batya, Rod here. I'll take the AFFO piece. So I'll start off by saying we believe in the fundamentals of the portfolio that we've built around the globe. Certainly, when you think about our ability to drive AFFO per share growth, it really starts with revenue growth. So I could give you a very short answer to your question. I'll give you the medium answer here. So the way we think about the bits and pieces that support and drive AFFO per share growth. Certainly in the US, we're continuing to see demand and activity levels that are in line with our previous long-term guide on OTBG, organic tenant billings growth in and around that 5%. You've heard us say we continue to see demand for our emerging markets. And in Europe, we're seeing escalating new business growth, which is really good. That's all very supportive over the long-term for the international towers that we have to deliver higher organic tenant billings growth than the US does by maybe a couple hundred basis points. That is certainly kind of front and center. CoreSite, as you heard from Steve and you see in our numbers and you have for several quarters is outperforming our expectations, and very accretive to overall growth rates, and that's been really nice to see. And we continue to build sites very opportunistically and disciplined, maybe not as many as we used to, but we build sites that adds to growth rate in revenue. So you put all that together and you're in the upper single digits in terms of revenue growth, call it 6% or 7%, somewhere in that range. And then we're focused on margin expansion, controlling the direct cost driving margins up. That means you get into that range around the gross margin point. SG&A, this year, loan SG&A is going down $30 million year-over-year decline last year as well. So SG&A cost control is also supportive and accretive to those growth rates. So when you think about all the things that we've done and everything that we see, the fundamentals in this business for our towers globally is really strong and could potentially deliver upper single-digit AFFO growth on the towers around the globe. Now the things that you do need to watch, we certainly watch and pay a lot of attention to, some of these are not under our control, of course, interest rates could go up or down, that could be positive or negative from time-to-time. FX, same thing could go up, could go down, it could be positive, could be negative. And then in particular, very specifically, we have the ATC India sale, which we are very confident will close out during the second half of this year just like we previously guided. That will be slightly dilutive, maybe about $0.08 to $0.09 on a per quarter basis. So if we close it early in October, you might see $0.08 or $0.09 dilution from that. And then you'll see the follow-on kind of tail of that into next year. But absent interest rates or assuming interest rates are flat, FX is flat and eliminating the ATC India, we have a portfolio of assets here that are performing very well operationally with the fundamentals that could deliver upper single-digit AFFO per share growth. Welcome."

            "name": "Steve Vondran",
            "content": "Good morning. And thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As you can see in our Q2 results and our revised full year outlook, we continue to build on the strength we saw in the underlying business at the outset of the year, with further validation of our initial expectations for strong activity across our platforms in 2024. I want to start today's remarks by thanking our teams across the world for their commitment to operational excellence and dedication to maximizing sales, bringing down costs and expanding margins across the portfolio. My comments today will focus on our latest views on our international portfolio and aim to address some of the recurring questions related to our international strategy in both developed and emerging markets that we received from investors in recent months. As we've communicated in the past, our international investment thesis is two-pronged. First, we see that the fundamentals that have driven performance in the US, such as ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption and a business model that benefits from tremendous operating leverage generally hold true across international markets. Second, by exporting our successful US model to investment in a diversified portfolio of assets that balance various risk and return profiles, we expect to expand and augment our long-term growth potential. Executing on this thesis has resulted in a footprint that includes diverse and sometimes complicated geographies. In our US markets, as a US business involves creating value, while solving for two types of risk: operational and financial. On the operational front, I can confidently tell you that we have the best operating teams in each geography across our portfolio, and we've overcome operational risks on a consistent basis through our shared global expertise and experience. In many cases, we leverage operating challenges to create new business opportunities and enhance existing or introduce new competitive advantages. This capability has been demonstrated through our reliable speed-to-market delivery on new tower builds, a global reputation of sophisticated regulatory approach that has afforded opportunities to effectively assess new markets and assets and the development of innovative power as a service model that provides best-in-class network uptime and supports initiatives about American Tower, our M&M customers and the communities we serve to deliver clear telecommunications networks. This is one of the key synergies American Tower brings an unmatched global knowledge and support platform to create value through operational excellence. Our investors benefit from our ability to utilize that platform to realize expanded market share of new business, drive best-in-class margins and leverage cost of capital advantages derived from our global balance sheet. When you take all these together, these benefits translate to enhanced value of the assets under the American Tower umbrella commanding a premium relative to the market implied some of the parts on a comparable basis. And where this does not hold true, we've taken corrective actions, which I'll touch on a little bit later. As I mentioned in previous remarks, our exposure to financial risk has been more acute in our emerging market portfolio particularly over the past several years as global macroeconomic factors have had an outsized impact on emerging markets. In these cases, those financial risks have, quite frankly, outpaced what we originally underwrote and together with care consolidation that contributed to financial results in certain emerging markets that fall short of our standards. We're taking action to improve those results. We've talked previously about our focus on cost controls, and I'm happy to say that those are paying off. At the midpoint of our guidance this year, we anticipate savings of over $40 million of SG&A, including bad debt relative to 2023. Our emerging market footprint has been a meaningful contributor to our cost efficiency progress to date, where we're shifting our focus from aggressively growing those portfolios to maximizing the return on our investments. We've also previously commented on raising the hurdle rates for the deployment of additional capital in those markets. These proactive actions and our refined strategic focus have corresponded to an expected 2024 reduction of over 40% in discretionary capital across Latin America, Africa and APAC compared to 2021. Conversely, in parts of our developed market footprint such as Europe and Corsair we're underwriting compelling mid-teens US dollar yields, we're increasing our investments alongside our capital partners. With an expanded developed market platform inclusive of the US and Canada, we've been able to more than double our discretionary capital in those markets over the same period. As a result, as you can see on slide 6, the allocation towards emerging markets has reduced from around two-thirds of our total in 2021 to less than a-third in our 2024 guidance. You'll likely see that number continue to trend down as we satisfy some of our previously contracted obligations in certain markets. Complementing our approach to discretionary capital allocation and supporting our proactive steps to enhance our global portfolio. In 2023, we divested non-core subscale underperforming assets like Mexico fiber and our Poland operations. And earlier this year, we announced our pending exit from India. Additionally, over the past several years, we further expanded our developed market exposure through our M&A focus across the US and Europe, all just name a few examples of the key strategic actions we've taken to date. Pro forma for the anticipated sale of our India business, attributable AFFO exposure to emerging markets will be approximately 25%. As a result of these actions, and those I'll touch on later, we believe our emerging market operations and our business as a whole are in a better position to deliver the higher quality, sustainable earnings growth that makes investing in communications infrastructure is so compelling. However, given the impacts of the financial risk and the stability and the quality of earnings our investor is whitefly demand from tower and communications infrastructure models, we expect to further reduce our relative exposure to emerging markets over time as we continue focus on incremental investments in developed economies. Now, that doesn't mean that you should assume we plan on divesting in particular markets. For our full management team and our Board regularly assess all options, including divestitures and we're going to remain opportunistic as we continue to actively manage our portfolio. We believe today that more long-term value is created by continuing to operate these portfolios, expand our gross margins, and reduce capital intensity, while repatriating cash flows to fund other global priorities such as deleveraging, paying our dividend, developed market investments with the highest quality return profiles, and looking ahead the potential for share buybacks. Meanwhile, continued operation of these portfolios means that we retain the optionality to reinvest into those markets if economic conditions and growth outlooks evolve. With that in mind, here's what we're focused on in our international segment going forward. First, just in the U.S., owning and operating highest quality assets and partner with leading carriers in each market helps provide more stable growth reduce long-term earning volatility resulting from consolidation. This is a critical lesson learned from our experience in India where consolidation post significant headwinds to growth over a multiyear period. Today, the vast majority of our revenues in Europe, Africa, and Latin America come from leading [ph] customers with competitive end market scale. Meaningful enhancements to our counterparty profile over the past several years have come in part due to carrier consolidation, but also as a result of proactively aligning growth initiatives and capital allocation both through development or M&A to our doing business with market leaders, and we remain committed to growing in Tier 1 global MNOs across our footprint. In some cases, particularly where growth capital is not required, we may also support network rollouts of new entrants or smaller operators. However, any time we assess expansion CapEx from carriers that fit this profile, the underwriting standards will be adjusted to account for potential incremental risk on a case-by-case basis. Next, scale is perhaps the most critical component of the international value creation flywheel. At a high level, our scale allows us to operate more profitably by leveraging shared overhead and a global balance sheet that creates cost of capital advantages. Importantly, scale also enables us to develop nationwide agreements that present a differentiated go-to-market solution for leading MNOs that that contract terms we view as critical. In particular, securing full lease-up rights on the assets we acquire, including the ability to monetize by colocation limit activity is crucial to our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Over the past decade, we had counter sale-leaseback opportunities with restrictive contract terms that limit the lease-up monetization. These are non-starters for us. Similarly, while recent currency devaluation in certain markets has exceeded our initial underwriting expectations, CPI-linked escalators have proven to be a critical tool to help mitigate long-term currency risk over the last decade. As we look forward to the balance of 2024 in the next several years, we believe we're uniquely positioned to create differentiated value for our customers. To maximize the benefits of scale portfolio we have in place, we're reinforcing a customer service-driven approach to everything we do. And our internal departments in each region are focused on supporting our sales team's ability to find new business with market leaders and deliver strong organic growth. Further, our global model allows our best-in-class operating team to remain flexible in addressing the ebbs and flows in demand through cross-border share resources, allowing for sustained speed-to-market delivery for our customers, while also supporting focus on cost management. To that end, we remain committed to extending the global efficiency and cost management achievements we made to-date. For 2018 and at the midpoint of our 2024 outlook, we expect to reduce cash SG&A, excluding bad debt as a percentage of revenue by roughly 210 basis points in Europe, Africa and LatAm in aggregate. We're now in the process of further globalizing our business functions to identify additional areas where we can leverage scale and technology to continued growth in customer service in the most cost efficient manner. In closing, we believe we have an opportunity to leverage our learnings for the last two-plus decades of global operations to continue managing and developing a best-in-class business that's capable of delivering high-quality, long-term earnings growth. We're going to continue actively managing our portfolio to ensure compelling mix of geographies and assets that are well positioned to support and monetize growing data demand and our operating capabilities to continue to serve a sustained competitive advantage. As our actions have demonstrated over the past year, we're prepared to make appropriate strategic decisions to ensure that we have a portfolio of the highest quality. Going forward, we believe that through our focus on maximizing organic growth disciplined and flexible reinvestment of cash flows and their growth opportunities and further leveraging our global scale and maximize profitability and returns, we can provide a value proposition that can't be replicated elsewhere, translating into expanded returns on capital over time. With that, I'll hand it over to Rod to discuss Q2 results and our revised outlook. Yes. Thanks, Simon. So with respect to the material M&A in the US and Europe, there are some rumors of portfolios coming available. And so I won't comment on any specific portfolios out there. But what I would reiterate is, we're very focused on our current capital allocation priorities, and in particular, delevering down below 5. Now we did give below 5 this quarter as a result of some of the onetime items, but that will likely go up above 5% next quarter. So we're focused on getting durably below 5. And we're also focused on our internal CapEx programs and the other capital priorities we've laid out there. And at this point, we haven't seen anything that we've evaluated that would take us off those priorities. So there's nothing that we're evaluating today that would be compelling for us today. And just as a reminder, anything that we would buy would need to be better than buying back our own stock. So when we look at those acquisition opportunities, we have to see an opportunity for that 1 plus 1 to equal 3 versus just kind of a growth for growth's sake. So what we're very interested in trying to grow our portfolios in the US and Europe and putting a developed markets that we're in. We aren't seeing opportunities today that look to be the right price, the right asset group for us to see that kind of synergy that would give us that opportunity today. Having said that, our teams are always evaluating everything out there and anything that comes to market, we'll evaluate if that evaluation changes, we'll let you guys know. When it comes to CoreSite, we have a lot of opportunity to invest in our existing campuses, and that's going to give us the best return on the [indiscernible] risk of any CapEx that we can deploy. And just to kind of put a fine point on it, we've got 44 megawatts under construction today and 61% of that is pre-leased. And so there's quite a bit of CapEx going into those campuses today that we feel very confident that we're going to get our mid-teens stabilized yields or better in those campuses that we're investing in. There are some tuck-ins. Miami is one example. And whenever you see us do that, the reason for us to do a tuck-in market like that is to try to build a new campus. We're very committed to our business model. We think it gives us the most resilient asset, the 1 that has the most durability over time and the best returns. And if we can create more campuses and have high interconnection cloud on-ramps in that ecosystem that commands a premium in market, we'll try to develop those. Those take time to develop, and so we do start small. And that's what you're more likely to see with us. Again, we're very committed to our business model being an interconnection hub. And there aren't many inorganic opportunities that would contribute to that model. If something did come available at that profile, we'd look at it. But today, we think we have ample opportunity to invest in that core business that's performing so well for us. Sure. Thanks for the question. So in the US, we're seeing 2024 play out much as we expected. We've seen a modest increase in application volume in Q2 over Q1. It is fairly broad-based. The main driver continues to be our carrier customers continuing to build out their 5G network. So it is largely still amendment driven, although we do see an uptick somewhat in new colocations over prior years, I wouldn't point to that as quite a densification phase yet. There's still a lot of room for the carriers to continue to expand their 5G presence. And while we're not getting specific about individual carriers, we would say that over half of our sites are now upgraded with mid-band 5G, but one carrier is ahead of the other two. And we have one that's over 80%, one that's a little over 60% now and one that's a little bit further behind. So there's a lot of runway there for them to continue to roll out mid-band 5G across the portfolio, and we expect them to continue to do that. With respect to our services guide, we are holding our guide for the year. Now there's always a degree of risk in that services guide because it's near term, but what we're seeing in our application flow and our services by is supportive that full year guide. So we do still feel good about the US activity levels kind of hitting those levels that saw at the beginning of the year. I believe the carrier capital spend projections are right in line with that kind of $34 billion to $36 billion is what they've said publicly. And that's again supportive of a level of development that we think is typical in this phase of a build. So we feel good about the US, and we think we're going to continue to see that up-tick. And we're also seeing usage patterns by the consumer continue to drive demand on those networks, and we're seeing the continued drive of that 20% to 30% up-tick in consumer demand that's going to continue to put pressure on the networks. And we're seeing that 5G is working for the carriers. It's letting them produce more gigabytes at lower cost. So we think that, that's going to continue to be a compelling business proposition for them to build 5G and with the addition of fixed wireless and some of the positive trends we're seeing in ARPUs and things like that, we're very confident that the US market will continue to grow and build and that densification phase will come. Sorry, the dividend question. At this point, Ric, there's no update on that. We're still waiting for the approval. And what we've said consistently is we believe it is second half of the year closing. So, I'm not sure when that's going to come out. It's hard to predict. But we do still anticipate getting that in that relevant timeframe. And in terms of closing afterwards, I think you could expect that to occur in kind of four to six weeks afterwards, somewhere in that timeframe. Sure. I'll give a little bit of color on that. I think it depends on the geography that you're in. If you look at Europe, they've been able to deploy 5G of a large proportion of the population there. I think high 80s, low 90s and Spain and Germany for most part. That's a combination of low and mid-band spectrum to. So there's still a runway of continued opportunity there to get the mid-band deployed there. I don't have specific stats on the percentage of mid-band because it's a little bit more nuanced in that market. And in France, we have OneCare it's a little bit it's a little bit further ahead in terms of 5G than the other. So of a mixed bag there. When you look at Africa, you are seeing some 5G deployments in some of the major cities, but it's still pretty nascent there. They're still focused on their 4G networks, augmenting those and improving the network quality over time. But we do think that you'll see 5G being deployed there, especially where the population centers are over time. So there's still some runway there for those 5G upgrades to occur in Africa. In Latin America, you have a little bit of 5G that's been deployed in Brazil and a couple of the other markets, but most of those markets are a little bit further behind. And even in Brazil, I'd say it's probably nascent in terms of the 5G deployments today. In many of those markets, there's been a delay in getting 5G spectrum in the hands of the carriers. Some of that is auctions that have been delayed, and some of it is the carriers pushing for a lower entry price there. And so I think as we see that play out over time, we'll continue to see opportunity there. The other thing that's happening in Brazil is the incumbents there are still integrating the oil assets they bought and that's depressing the activities there a little bit as they deal with those integrations and combining those networks together. So I'd say it's very consistent with the way we kind of view the international markets that they're a little bit behind the developed markets, the deployment of 5G. We are starting to see some green shoots in some of those markets where they need those cheaper gigabytes that 5G delivers, and we're seeing some deployments there, but there's a lot of runway ahead to deploy it there. Yes. Thanks, Ric. We're looking at everything in terms of cost management. And our goal is to enhance our margin profile by direct cost savings in addition to SG&A. So what you're seeing there is exactly what you would expect. We're looking at that portfolio and where we have underperforming assets that we don't think are going to see near-term activity, we are decommissioning those to save the OpEx on those and doing what's right. So we are doing some accelerated work there. Rob, do you want to touch on some of the other elements. Sure. Let me start with the services piece of that. So our Q1 services gross margin was about twice what our Q4 2023 was and our Q2 is about 50% up from Q1. So we are seeing acceleration in that services business. And again, we believe from the pipeline that we're looking at today that we're on track to hit our full year services guide on that. And again, there's a risk in that services pipeline, and we've seen it play out a couple of times in the past, but our teams are confident at this point that we're on track to be able to do that. With respect to our MLAs, what we were -- what we've disclosed is that we had one customer that rolled off the MLA earlier this year. And so we haven't really talked specifically about anything beyond that. But because we've telegraphed that pretty clearly, I think you can get an idea that that's where we kind of where we are. Those comprehensive portions are typically 3 to 5 years, so it's not just 5 years. There's a different range on those. And since we do have 1 customer that's off of that kind of use-right fee that underpins that smoothing out of growth over time, that customer is a little bit more dependent on the volumes that they're doing. And so there will be a little bit more peaks and valleys in terms of activity with them. The works on instant we're fine either way on that. We take a long-term view of these agreements. And if getting into another holistic type of agreement makes sense, we will. And if we don't think it does, we'll stay and pay up the drink, and we're very confident in our ability to monetize that way. With respect the activity and how that translates into our organic growth over time, it's too early to be giving kind of a 2025 guide at this point. We'll do that in February, like we always do. But we are encouraged by the growth that we see in terms of the activity by the carriers. We do have one major customer who is off the holistic portion of their agreement. They still have underling MLA, but the holistic portion is expired. And so if those volumes continue, that's a positive. We also have what we call our vertical market segment, which are smaller customers, and that's also very much dependent on volume and timing on that. And we're seeing good activity there as well. So we're encouraged by that. When we look out into the future, we do have a level of contractually locked in growth for 2025 via our comprehensive MLA and that's similar to what we see in 2024 as well as consistent growth from the escalator of about 3%. On the churn side, in 2025, we're going to continue to see a level of elevated spread churn. The final tranche of that spread churn commenced in Q4 of this year, that's about $70 million of annualized monthly run rate. That will impact our growth rates through Q3 of next year. In terms of kind of the swing factors that you would see in terms of 2025, there's a portion the growth that's not locked in via the conference of MLAs. Again, I mentioned one of the big three carriers and the vertical markets. So that's a swing factor. We also have our eye on the timing and scale of any potential churn from US cellular. Over the next couple of years in the event that deal is approved and closes. We'd expect the overlap to be modest, but the timing and the scale of that churn could put some pressure on rates temporarily. And who knows, we could end up signing another conference of MLA or agreement that would also potentially impact what that number looks like. So there's a number of swing factors for 2025, and that's why we can't really give guidance until we get to February. But at the end of day, we're still confident that we're going to have continued growth supportive of our longer-term guide. Thanks for the question. Let me just clarify, the 25% is pro forma for the India transaction. So a little bit higher today. Once we close the new transaction, we'll be at roughly 25%. And as we look at some of the macroeconomic conditions, particularly the FX headwinds that we've been seeing, that's kind of given us the choice to start pivoting a little bit more away from the exposure into those emerging market economies, given what we're seeing in the macroeconomic conditions today. So what we're doing is pivoting more of our discretionary CapEx to the developed markets. This isn't a new thing. We've been doing that for the last several years, and we haven't done an emerging market transaction in quite a few years now. And the bulk of our CapEx has been going toward developed markets. What that will do if that trend continues, and we expect it to, is it will reduce that emerging market exposure over time. We're not setting a kind of line in the sand a day for where we think it should be, but we do think it appropriate to work that percentage down over time by focusing on our developed markets. Having said that, we will continue to support our Tier 1 MNOs in those markets. We'll make some discretionary CapEx investments where it makes sense or where they meet the return criteria that we set out for markets. But in terms of expanding in those markets are looking to double down or anything. That's not something you're likely to see us do given our desire to reduce the exposure we have to that -- those emerging market economies. Sure. I'll hit the first part of that, Rod can hit the second. We always are looking to actively manage our portfolio. So the management team and the Board regularly review our portfolio and look at the assets under our management. And we're always looking to say, what's going to create the best long-term shareholder value. And so when you think about some of the benefits that American Tower brings to these portfolios, I touched on this a little bit in my prepared remarks, but I'll reiterate it. We have operational excellence across the globe, and that operational excellence lets us drive best-in-class margins. It lets us optimize the amount of new business we get, so organic growth is better under American Tower. And so we believe that we create a lot more value for those assets that are under our umbrella than anybody else can. Now where that doesn't hold true if we think that somebody else can create more value, we would look at divesting it, and that's what we do with India. So absolutely, price is one of the considerations that would factor in when we think about whether a disposition create more value than we continue to operate it. But at this point, we think the best thing that we can do is keep those assets under our umbrella, continue to operate them in the way that we do and continue to focus on the gross margin and the growth of the organic revenue there. And if we ever do decide that a disposition is more desirable at that point, it's going to be more valuable because we've created more cash flow on the assets. So right now, that's where our decision point is. But we'll always be nimble and we'll always look to maximize the long-term value. Now there are some subscale portfolios and some ancillary businesses that we would think about. If you look at what we've done over the past couple of years, we did divest Mexico fiber. We did divest Poland, one because it was subscale, the other because we thought somebody else could maximize that business better. And so when you look at some of those portfolios in our overall portfolio, that's the type of thing that we think about. But there's no process we've announced today and nothing I would point to of any scale that we think would make sense in the short-term. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll address demand and then I'll address who we're leasing to a separate issues. We're seeing broad-based demand from a lot of different sectors. Part of that, there's a scarcity of supply in some of the markets that we're in. But our key customer base that's driving long-term demand in CoreSite continues to be enterprises that are deploying hybrid cloud deployment, hybrid cloud technology. And we see a very long tail of that business. And it's probably helpful for me to talk a little bit about how we curate our customer mix. CoreSite doesn't just lease to just anybody who wants to lease space in their facilities, particularly when we're looking at our scale and hyperscale space that's available, we want to lease to customers that help build the ecosystem. And that's why we are pretty selective in terms of who we lease to. And so that hybrid cloud deployment is the perfect type of customer to help build that ecosystem. We are seeing demand from AI, and the inferencing layer of AI is perfectly suited for our highly interconnected ecosystem like CoreSite because it helps distribute the content that the AI is generating. And so we do see some demand there. We're being selective in terms of who we're willing to lease to in that. We do recognize that not all customers are kind of built the same in that space. So we want to make sure that we're partnering with people who have good long-term business plans there. But what's driving the overall demand is just a general scarcity of supply there, but we're continuing to lease to that core customer base, expanding our enterprise reach for hyper cloud deployments, a little bit of AI and then continuing to serve a lot of the customers that we already have there as they expand their needs. And those are the primary drivers from who we're leasing to you. Sure. Those are two very different projects. So I'll start with the Raleigh. So the Raleigh data center is really being done by our US tower division, working with CoreSite. And that is our continued evolution as we work with various partners on the edge, we needed a little bit more of a sandbox for them to play in. And Raleigh was a good market. It has low power costs. There's a lot of enterprise there that are working on edge applications. And so we think it's a good place for us to kind of start there, and we are seeing demand in that market that we think we can serve there. That one is expandable. It's on a tower site, so we were able to get easy access to land, there's power, there's fiber. It was just a great location for us. And so we'll see how that plays out over time. Again, that's part of our experimentation on the edge, and we do have some clear visibility into monetizing that as well. So that's a benefit of having sandbox that makes money. The second one, DE3. So this is a little bit different. This is our first purpose-built data center in Denver. And while we do have a small presence in Denver, it's not really a campus effect yet. And what we've said over time is we're open to structures where we're a minority partner where it gives us the ability to build a campus over time. So for that particular facility, we're taking advantage of the opportunity that we have to meet the demand for a strategic customer to support the ecosystem in Denver, and we're utilizing our partnership and the capital flexibility that that we have with that partnership to not redirect any of our current cash flow -- our current CapEx program to that and our partner is happy to fund that development. And the reason we're doing that is to really start building that campus in in Denver and to do it a capital-efficient way for us. And so we think that's the right structure for that facility. That parcel is large enough to build other buildings. We have retained ownership of those other buildings in CoreSite. And so if we build future pieces of the campus, that would likely be done in CoreSite. And we do have the ability to buy back the one that's being built there, if we decide that that's the right thing to do as we build an ecosystem over time. And that structure today is -- it's very similar to what you're seeing other data centers do with private capital partners. CoreSite's going to own 15%, Stone People own 85% as we developed that first facility there in Denver. Sure. Look, at a high level, you want to be the number one or number two independent tower company in a market, if you can. That's your ideal situation to be in. At a broad level, scale means being strategically relevant to your customers. So you could have some localized scale without having national scale as long you're relevant enough to have some leverage in the negotiations with the customers there. And so that's really how we think about scale. We have some markets where we're subscale, but we're able to leverage regional scale in those by using operating leverage. And what I mean by that is we can serve some of those under scale markets with the human capital we have in other parts of those markets. So we might operate a small country from a larger country that's nearby. And that's how we're getting some operational scale. It helps us get even better returns in there that you really would naturally get in a subscale market. But at the end of the day, we want to be kind of the number one or two in the market in terms of independence, captives are a little bit different because they have different dynamics with it. But that's how we think about it overall. And we do have -- like if you look at Latin America, about 97% of our sites are in markets where we're the leader. In Africa, it's well over half of the sites that we're the market leader in. A little bit lower in Europe today. But overall, we felt we have adequate scale in all those markets to be strategically relevant to the customers and to get the cost synergies that you get. Sure, I'll take the further part about the MLAs and Rod can touch on the growth. The conference of MLAs that we have in the U.S. are pretty much uniquely in the U.S. right now. We've talked to partners internationally about those contract structures and there's some interest in learning more about them. But because the -- they haven't been using those markets before, there's some understandable concern on the counterparty side, about being the first one to take the leap into that. So we've encouraged them to talk to our U.S. customers to understand the benefits of that. So I'm hopeful that we can export those because, again, those create value for both parties. It gives us predictability on the revenue side. It gives customers predictability on their cost side. It vastly simplifies the deployment of networks by the customers. So I'm hopeful that our international customers will embrace that, and we'll continue talking with them about it until they do, but none to announce right now, Batya."

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir. \nAdam Smith: Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.\n I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO; and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions.\n Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business; our collections expectations in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. \n You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time to time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. \nSteven Vondran: Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in the results we reported this morning, mobile network upgrades and digital transformation trends are driving compelling demand across our tower and data center platforms. 5G rollouts are contributing to an acceleration in our U.S. application pipeline and another sequential step up in co-location and amendment growth in Europe.\n Solid demand in Africa continue to drive elevating business growth, and retail demand resulted in another quarter of strong sales performance at CoreSite, which you'll hear more about later on. Before handing the call over to Rod, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the key factors that have driven performance in our U.S. and Canada tower business and underpin the evaluation and execution of our global expansion strategy.\n In particular, we believe that our focus on asset quality, operational excellence and contract structures, all through the prism of long-term value creation, have been the most critical factors in determining our ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption and our ability to drive leading performance on our assets over multiple network investment cycles.\n Over the last 25 years, we've developed a scaled nationwide portfolio of approximately 43,000 sites across the U.S. and Canada. This portfolio has been methodically constructed, primarily through the acquisition of high-quality carrier design and constructive tower portfolios, of which nationwide networks have been built and expanded upon through each successive G and have further benefited from the transition to neutral-host operation.\n We've complemented the acquisition of these target assets with select high-quality independent tower provider portfolios, smaller tuck-in portfolios and build-to-suit sites, which taken together represent meaningful scale. Our ability to be highly selective in the assets that we've aggressively pursued for acquisition and development, the assets we've chosen not to pursue and the standards we've used to underwrite our growth are the result of robust internal analysis and due diligence capabilities that rely on data insights that we've accumulated through our history as a tower operator.\n These insights have reinforced our understanding of the asset location, competition considerations and structural dynamics come together to create the potential for differentiated value creation. For example, our focus on high-quality assets in premier locations has resulted in a portfolio that's geographically skewed towards suburban and rural environments and transport corridors where the vast majority of Americans live and travel as well as towers that are structurally designed for co-tenancy, which we believe has enabled us to generate leading new business growth on our assets.\n Similarly, by focusing our assets on significant structural capacity, we believe we can reduce overall operating and redevelopment costs allowing for profit and return maximization at the asset level at industry best speed to market for carrier deployments on our towers.\n We are seeing these factors come together to result in significant value creation on our assets. Notably, cash operating profit margins for our U.S. and Canada Property segment have expanded by over 420 basis points since 2016, the year following our Verizon transaction in the U.S. As we continue to focus on driving more new business and efficiency at the asset level, we see a path to further increasing the profitability of our U.S. and Canada business going forward.\n Turning to our operating model. Through our focus on efficiency and delivering exceptional value for customers, we've invested in technology and then build up of capabilities that we believe enhance the service we provide our customers as a value of our product offering. For example, through our application services automation programs, we've continuously reduced cycle times, further supporting critical speed-to-market advantages for our customers, which translates into accelerated revenue realization for our business. \n Elsewhere in our Services segment, we've combined investments in data quality and governance with the development of internal data platforms to improve our overall service offerings and asset integrity. Over time, customer feedback shows that these investments have resulted in a consistent upward trajectory in customer satisfaction, achieved by providing a differentiated customer experience of high asset integrity.\n In our land management operations, we're also taking approach that's focused on our customers' needs and expanding the profitability of our sites. Through our Tower Asset Protection Program, we performed thousands of transactions a year that improved the ground rights and eased site access conditions, a critical factor for our customers. And over the last decade, we've deployed significant capital at attractive rates of return and admitted thousands of contracts to protect our assets and mitigate growth in land rent, supporting margin performance.\n Finally, as we've said publicly many times, contract terms and structure are critical to realizing the full value of the assets we only manage. And our approach has been centered around creating long-term value for American Tower and our carrier customers, even when it can potentially come at the expense of short-term wins.\n Perhaps the most important capability we've built internally over the last 2 decades is knowing our assets and understanding their value. As a result, we've been able to achieve outstanding growth and create significant shareholder value at our traditional MLA agreement, while also developing innovative structures such as the comprehensive MLA. \n Under these agreements, we're able to secure guaranteed growth over a multiyear period in a way that maximizes the value of our assets while providing a degree of insulation from quarter-to-quarter ebbs and flows in wireless network spending. Critically, we've seen that these contracts represented a compelling value proposition for our carrier customers.\n By lowering their total cost of ownership when compared to self-performance, by providing a framework to leverage our skill for their networks that translates to budgetary operational visibility and by creating administrative efficiencies that yield lower transaction costs on sell-side deployments.\n Taking all this together, we've seen this focus on the right assets, high-quality contracts with operational excellence facilitate increasing monetization and growth in mobile data consumption and corresponding carrier's CapEx increases over time.\n Over the course of the 4G investment cycle between 2010 and 2018, average mobile data consumption for smartphone increased from less than 100 megawatts per month to 7 gigabytes per month. And over that period, carriers were deploying approximately $29 billion annually on average, up from approximately $23 billion during 3G.\n As we have moved into the 5G investment cycle, for early 2019 till today, we've once again seen mobile data consumption for smartphone grow to almost 30 gigabytes per month in 2024. We've seen early 5G subscribers consuming roughly 2x the mobile data compared to the average 4G subscriber. And we see average annual carrier CapEx step up to approximately $36 billion a year.\n This CapEx investment translated to the approximately $230 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growths we delivered last year, much of which was attributed to 5G activity as well as an expectation for growth on a per-site basis in 2024 that significantly exceeds the average seen during the 4G deployment cycle. That brings us to today, where we continue to see all of our key customers actively working on network upgrades and rollouts and the 5G cycle playing out in line with the broader expectations underwritten our long-term guidance. \n On our last call, we indicated that we expected a year-over-year increase in contributions for our Services segment due in part to early indications of uptick in our application pipeline as well as conversations that our teams were having with our customers on the ground. The activity we saw in Q1 reinforces that expectation. Specifically, contributions in our Services segment for the quarter came in ahead of our internal expectations. And on the application side, Q1 volume was over 70% higher than what we saw in Q4 of last year. In fact, March represented the highest volume level over the trailing 12 months. It was supported by broad-based step-ups across our major U.S. customers. \n Now while there's only some level of risk associated with our expectations in the Services segment, I'm pleased to say that what we've seen thus far supports the 2024 guidance we provided in February, including approximately $195 million, the expected services revenue contributions; approximately 4.7% organic tenant billings growth at $180 million to $190 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growth, one of our strongest years to date.\n So as we move forward, we believe our U.S. tower portfolio is uniquely positioned to continue driving compelling growth as 5G expected increases in mobile data consumption and associated carrier investments driving increasing demand for our assets over time.\n Importantly, by leveraging that same expertise to develop our leading global portfolio, we're well positioned to monetize similar trends across our global footprint, while delivering a differentiated experience and value proposition to our customers.\n Further, we believe the factors that we're taking in through today as well as the global focus on increasing efficiency in our cost structure provide a path to continue converting topline growth at a rate that expands already attractive cash operating profit margins and creates incremental shareholder value. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q1 performance and our updated outlook. Rod? \nRodney Smith: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We are off to a solid start to 2024 with Q1 performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. These results, together with the positive trends highlighted by Steve, the various initiatives we have in place to drive profitability and margin expansion and our optionality and discipline and selectively deploying capital towards projects yielding the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, give us confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth, quality of earnings and shareholder returns for 2024 and beyond.\n Before I dive into the results and our revised 2024 outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, the strong reoccurring fundamentals that underpin our business are again highlighted in our Q1 performance with consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.4% and another exceptional leasing quarter at CoreSite, including its highest quarter of retail new business signed since Q4 of 2020. Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate cost discipline resulting in strong year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I will touch on in a moment.\n Next, in India, the collection trends we saw in Q4 of 2023 continued into Q1, allowing us to reverse approximately $29 million of previously reserved revenue. Separately, while we continue to anticipate a second half 2024 closing on our sale of ATC India to Brookfield, we have already made progress in accelerating certain payments included in the potential $2.5 billion total proceeds associated with the transaction, including the repatriation of approximately $100 million net of withholding's tax back to the U.S. earlier this month.\n Additionally, we are making progress towards monetizing our optionally convertible debentures issued by VIL ahead of the anticipated closing of our India transaction. Executing the intended purpose of the debentures in serving as a liquid asset to backstop outstanding receivable balances, we expect to use the anticipated proceeds from the India sale to pay down existing indebtedness. We will continue to keep our shareholders informed as incremental progress is made towards the closing of our transaction. \n Finally, we successfully accessed the debt capital markets last month, issuing $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 5.3%, with proceeds used to pay down floating rate debt. \n Turning to first quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 6, consolidated property revenue growth was 3.3% or over 4.5% excluding noncash straight line revenue while absorbing roughly 100 basis points of FX headwinds. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was approximately 1.8% or over 4% excluding straight line, which includes over 1% impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 3.7% or roughly 6% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes a benefit associated with the improved collections in India, partially offset by the timing of the sale of our Mexico fiber business at the end of Q1 in 2023 and a reduction in Latin America termination fees as compared to the prior year.\n Finally, revenue in our Data Centers business increased by 10.6%, continuing the outperformance versus our initial underwriting plan as strong demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues and the backlog of record new business signed over the last 2 years begins to commence in a meaningful way. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, supported by strong demand across our global footprint. \n In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.6% and over 5.5% absent Sprint-related churn. As expected, growth in the quarter was slightly below our full-year guidance of 4.7%. As we lap modestly elevated churn that commenced in Q2 of 2023, we would expect Q2 and Q3 growth rates to each accelerate to roughly 5% before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation.\n Our International segment drove 6.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting an expected step down from the Q4 2023 rate of 7.7%, as we see moderation in CPI-linked escalators. Meanwhile, contributions from co-location and amendments remain strong with another sequential acceleration in Europe and a continuation of elevated contribution rates of around 8% in Africa.\n Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.2% or nearly 8% excluding the impacts of noncash straight line while absorbing 90 basis points in FX headwinds. Cash-adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 240 basis points year-over-year to 64.9% taking certain expense timing in India reserve benefits and further supported by our ongoing cost management focus. In fact, cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined approximately 5% year-over-year in Q1 and was down roughly 7% of our Q1 2022 levels.\n Additionally, gross margin from our U.S. services business came in just over $16 million, a decline of roughly 50% year-over-year, though representing an acceleration of nearly 70% of our Q4 2023 levels. This performance, together with the broad-based application pipeline buildup discussed by Steve in his prepared remarks, gives us confidence in our expectation for accelerating activity continuing through the duration of the year and is supportive of our full-year U.S. services outlook.\n Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 10% and 9.8%, respectively, supported by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. \n Now shifting to our revised full-year outlook. As I mentioned, we are pleased with the results to date and the sustainable demand trends underpinning our performance. However, given the close proximity to our previously released guidance, we have kept core full-year assumptions largely unchanged. With that in mind, our revised outlook includes several notable updates. \n First, we have taken the strong collections activity in India through the first quarter, which, as I mentioned earlier, resulted in approximately $29 million in revenue reserve reversals compared to approximately $16 million in revenue reserves assumed for Q1 in our prior outlook, resulting in a net benefit to plan of $45 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO.\n Reserve assumptions for April through December remained unchanged, resulting in a net reserve for the year of $20 million compared to the prior year outlook assumption of $65 million. Next, we have revised our FX assumptions for the year, resulting in a modest headwind compared to our prior outlook. \n Finally, while our net interest assumptions remain relatively unchanged, we have increased our interest expense due to elevated rates, which was partially offset by modest interest expense reductions through a reduced debt balance attributed to the accelerated India proceeds I mentioned earlier and further offset by higher interest income.\n With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $30 million compared to prior outlook, driven by $45 million of upside related to the positive collections in India during the first quarter, partially offset by $15 million associated with negative FX impacts. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across all regions, including approximately 4.7% in the U.S. and Canada, 11% to 12% in Africa, 5% to 6% in Europe and 2% in both LatAm and APAC, collectively driving approximately 5% for international and 5% on a consolidated basis. We will continue to assess our first quarter momentum as we work through the year.\n Turning to Slide 9. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $40 million as compared to prior outlook, driven by the flow-through of the revised revenue reserve assumptions in India, partially offset by $5 million of FX headwinds.\n Moving to Slide 10. We are similarly raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.42, supported by the revised Indian reserve assumption benefits, partially offset by FX. As I mentioned, although we are raising expectations for interest expense, it is offset on a net basis by a similar increase in interest income.\n Turning to Slide 11. We are reiterating our capital allocation plans for 2024, which is focused on selectively funding projects we expect to drive the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, sustained growth and quality of earnings, executing on an accelerated pathway to balance sheet strength and financial flexibility and delivering an attractive total shareholder return profile as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. This includes maintaining a relatively flat annual common dividend declaration of $6.48 per share or approximately $3 billion in 2024, with an expectation to resume growth again in 2025, all subject to Board approval. \n Moving to the right side of the slide, our disciplined approach to capital allocation, together with recurring topline growth and its high conversion to profitability through cost management, all support the progress we've made to achieving our goal of 5x net leverage by the end of the year. While our Q1 net leverage already stands at 5x, it is important to note that the metric for this quarter benefits from the Indian reserve reversals previously mentioned, and we'd expect to be above 5x in Q2. These efforts, combined with our successful capital markets execution year-to-date, have further reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet as a strategic asset, which will remain a key focus moving forward.\n Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are off to a great start to 2024. Our visibility into a solid foundation of recurring contracted growth across our global business combined with an accelerating pipeline supporting our expectations for future activity, a keen focus on cost discipline and margin expansion and a continued demonstration of strategically deploying capital while enhancing balance sheet strength, gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth over the long term for our shareholders while being a best-in-class operator for our stakeholders globally.\n With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew Niknam: Congrats on the quarter. Just 2, if I could. First, on the U.S., maybe if you can get a little bit more color on the acceleration in activity you saw in the quarter and maybe what that implies for services and new leasing expectations going forward. I'm more curious whether this was broad-based across the big 3 and maybe even DISH or more limited in nature. \n And then secondly, on Data Centers, I think you talked about your highest quarter of signed retail leasing since 4Q '20, any color you can share in terms of what's driving the uptick in new business? And it seems to imply there isn't much in the way of macro headwinds or caution that some of your peers have talked about. But again, just curious if there are any signs of macro caution there. \nSteven Vondran: Sure. Thanks for the question. In the U.S., again, we're seeing an acceleration in Q1 relative to Q4. And our application pipeline coming in, in Q1 was about 70% higher than Q4. And our services gross margin came in at about $16 million in the quarter, which was higher than we had expected. So what we're seeing is an acceleration in activity that really underpins the guidance that we gave last quarter. And just to kind of reiterate what that is, on our services, we're expecting our services about $195 million in revenue, about $100 million in gross margin.\n And look, while that services is inherently hard to predict sometimes, the activity we're seeing in Q1 along with the conversations we're having with kind of the boots on the ground teams from our customers, that gives us confidence that we're going to hit that services guide for the year. And so we'll continue to watch it and see how that cadence goes throughout the rest of the year. But everything we're seeing in Q1 gives us some optimism there.\n When it comes to our property revenue growth from that, again, I'll remind you that a lot of our revenue assumptions are underpinned by our comprehensive MLAs. So at this point, the acceleration that we're seeing in growth, that doesn't change our guidance in terms of what we're expecting to see in the U.S. Again, I'll reiterate that. We're expecting to see organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% in the U.S. And that will be a little bit different quarter-by-quarter.\n In Q1, it was 4.6%. And I will expect that to go up a little bit in the middle of the year and then the final tranche of Sprint churn that hits in October, we'll weigh that down a bit in Q4. But overall, we're encouraged by that. In terms of what we're seeing, it is fairly broad-based. I don't want to get into individual customer activity levels, but we are seeing some broad-based activity pick up in the U.S. with all of our major customers. And again, we're encouraged that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year.\n When it comes to CoreSite, yes, we have 2 years of kind of record sales and we have a healthy pipeline this year. And we've got a tough comp compared to last year. So I don't know that we'll achieve another record year of sales, but we're hoping. And we did have a very strong quarter on retail this year, and that was really exciting to see.\n In terms of the headwinds for that business, we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. Again, what's underpinning the growth in CoreSite right now, the bulk of that growth is being driven by enterprises that are going to hybrid cloud IT infrastructure. And there's a long tail event that we see out there. There's still a lot of companies that have their own data centers, and there are a lot of companies that went cloud native or that had moved everything to the cloud, and they're looking for a different cost structure, and they're going to this hybrid environment. And that's still the biggest driver we have, and we see a very, very long tail of that activity out there.\n We are seeing an uptick in activity from AI. In particular, the inferencing portion of AI models is kind of perfectly suited for CoreSite. You're going to have these large learning models that are done in the big hyperscale data centers, but when you start interfacing with the users to provide that data to them and also get the inputs from them, you need a distribution channel. And CoreSite is perfectly suited to provide that type of distribution. So we are seeing some activity there.\n In terms of kind of industry headwinds, we're not seeing a falloff in our funnel today. We're watching it just like everyone else is. Some of the things that people have highlighted, some of the demand and the supply issues are things that actually drive pricing up, so where we have markets that are constrained supplied, that's actually driving pricing up. We've got more megawatts under construction today than we ever had before at CoreSite, so we're planning for that demand cycle to continue. But I'll just reiterate that a large portion of that is pre-leased, more than we ever have before.\n In fact, our pre-leasing percentage right now of the stuff that we have under construction is about 35%. And that's down a tick from last quarter because we've placed some things in service, but we're still seeing healthy demand for pre-leasing, and we'll continue to explore that as well. \n We're still seeing growth in interconnect, and I know that there's been some discussion out there about grooming of cross connects. And that's something that we constantly see with customers as they're trying to optimize our cost structure. But even with a little bit of grooming going on, we're still seeing healthy growth there. \n So again, I think we're very optimistic about the demand for CoreSite, the pipeline that we're seeing, hoping for another record year of sales, but that's a tough comp. So I'm sure my sales team is cringing hearing me say that, but we feel good about it. And we're not seeing headwinds weigh on it today. But again, we're watching the market just like everybody else is, and we'll be appropriately cautious if we see that demand slowing down. But that's not what we're seeing from our sales teams today. \nRodney Smith: Matt, this is Rod. If I could just add briefly here 1 or 2 comments. So of course, as Steve said, we've had record levels of new business in the past. And what that is leading to is higher revenue growth now as we're delivering that new business that we signed up over the last couple of years. So you saw in the quarter, we had a north of 10% revenue growth rate. As I said in my prepared remarks, that is the result of delivering on that new business, those record levels of new business we signed up over the last couple of years.\n The last couple of years of new business has also led to a high level of backlog. So we're up in the close to $60 million in terms of backlog, which is signed deals that we haven't commenced into revenue yet. That's up from a run rate of being closer to $40 million or $45 million in the last couple of years. So that the new business we sign up, it translates into backlog and then it translates into revenue and revenue growth. So with the activity level we've seen in the last couple of years, the high backlog we have today, that positions CoreSite very well to have high levels of growth over the next couple of years. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. \nMichael Rollins: Just following up on your comments regarding the pickup in domestic activity in the first quarter. Do you see this as a rising tide for the tower category? Or do you see American Tower taking share from your competitors? \n And then secondly, you referenced, I think, in one of the slides and some of your comments that the activity is supporting your long-term guide for the domestic business. If you can recap for us where you see the longer-term average annual organic tenant billings growth and how these changes in activity levels may influence those outcomes? \nSteven Vondran: Sure. Thanks for the question. So what we're seeing in the U.S., it's clearly -- it's 1 quarter results. And again, the conversations that we're having give us the optimism that our guide for the year is kind of spot on in terms of the customer is starting to ramp up. I don't have a lot of visibility into what my competitors are seeing. So I don't think I can give an opinion on whether what we're seeing is materially different than what they're seeing.\n But when I reflect on what the customers need to do to complete their mid-band 5G rollouts and when I think about what their long-term goals are on their network, there's a lot of work yet to be done. So what I think that we're seeing play out is the same cycle we saw in 4G, the same cycle we saw in 3G, where there's an initial push, then there's a little bit of a slowdown while they're optimizing their network and then there's another push. And I think that we're starting to see that.\n Now where I do think we've really differentiated ourselves is that our MLAs do provide a little bit of an easy button for our customers, and we're able to give them great speed to market, great cost predictability. And I think that, that does give us greater market share over time. \n Back to kind of our longer-term guide for the U.S., just to remind everyone, we said that we expect at least 5% organic tenant billings growth on average for the period between 2023 and 2027, and that would be 6% excluding the Sprint churn that we have. And in 2023, that OTBG number was 5.3%, and we're projecting 4.7% this year. And that's all while we're absorbing greater than 100 basis points of Sprint churn a year in each of those years. So we see the activity levels very supportive of that long-term guide.\n And again, we feel good about the cycle of 5G. We feel good about the carrier activity that we're seeing and about the way 5G is performing in terms of giving them megabytes of data or gigabytes of data a lot cheaper than they could produce it any other way. \nMichael Rollins: And just 1 other quick one. Any shift in the mix between amendments and densification within the domestic activity? \nSteven Vondran: A little bit. Again, I think when you think about these cycles that the carriers build in, the first push that you see is always a coverage network and that implies overlays on existing sites. And then, when they slow down and start optimizing, part of that optimization is infill to get better quality of service where they might have some coverage gaps or might not be getting the optimal service. And that always implies more co-locations. So we are seeing some demand for that as well.\n Again, we're -- we see some kind of broad-based activity, so it's -- we're seeing both, and we're seeing that across the carriers. And again, I would just remind folks that we do have comprehensive MLAs in place with some of our customers that smooth out some of those cycles of the ups and downs of the activity levels. We did disclose in Q1 that one of our major customers rolled off of their comprehensive MLAs. And so for that customer, when you come off the comprehensive portion and get to more of the kind of pay by the drink, there is more seasonality in terms of the commencement of those leases as they sign them. And so from that perspective, activity levels will drive the -- that portion of our business, more than they do for the ones that are in the comprehensive MLAs. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Steve, thanks for the comments on the portfolio review. Maybe you could just review the M&A market more broadly. Are there things that you might be looking at doing either buying or selling beyond the India situation? And how you think about that? And then any other things that come out of that, any sort of portfolio assessment? \n And then any updates on the deal timing in India? I think we talked last quarter perhaps about sort of October 1 as being kind of a placeholder, but any updates on regulatory processes in India at this point? \nSteven Vondran: Yes. Sure. I'll start with India. No updates at this point. It's very hard to predict when that approval will come through. So we're still expecting second half of the year. But we'll let you know as soon as we know what's happening on that.\n In terms of broader M&A, our team is looking at everything that's kind of out there for sale. And that's just part of our standard practice. There's nothing that we're seeing that's compelling that would take us off of our capital allocation priorities that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and that is our first priority of any of our capital allocations paying our dividend, but then we're really focused on delevering after that, making sure we get down to our 5x net leverage.\n And so when we're looking at the M&A that's out there, there's nothing that we're seeing today that is strategically important or at the right price that would make us change our mind on that at this point.\n When it comes to our own portfolio, and I just want to be clear about this, we're not doing a strategic review specifically, if anything, meaning there's nothing that we're intending to sell out there today. Having said that, we do have some businesses that may not be as strategic for us or they may not be at scale. And if the right buyer with the right price came along, we would consider something there. But as we look at our portfolio kind of across the globe, our goal is to figure out if there are businesses that are not meeting our original underwriting criteria.\n The first thing is what can we do to fix those, how do we drive greater sales, how do we get more efficiency in the market to drive margins up? And we'll try that first. If we decided to exit other market, they'd have to be because we're getting the right price and that we think it's more accretive to our shareholders than holding it. So at this point, there's nothing to point to in our portfolio that we're actively looking to dispose of. But again, there are some nonstrategic businesses for us out there that we would consider if the right buyer and the right price came along. \nRodney Smith: Simon, this is Rod. Simon, I'm going to add a couple of comments on India just to give everyone listening a couple of the numbers and a reminder. So as Steve said, the timing is still second half of this year. Everything is going well, certainly within our expectation. I just want to remind everyone that we announced when we signed a deal with Brookfield to sell 100% of India that it would have total proceeds that could be up to $2.5 billion. That comes in a couple of different forms. It will be $2 billion in terms of the -- let's call it, the purchase price, which includes the intercompany debt that we have in there as well as the term loan that we have in India. \n The intercompany debt is little less than $0.5 billion, and then, the term loan is about $120 million. It also includes some working capital, some receivables and the OCD that I'm sure you're familiar with that we put in place with VIL. So the OCD was about $200 million. The other India receivables was a little less than about $200 million. And then there's also a ticking fee component that we get that is based on the mechanics between signing and closing.\n You put all those things together, it comes up to about $2.5 billion. We are in the process of realizing and taking some of these proceeds out of India. So you did see -- and you'll see in the details, we removed about $100 million from India and took it back to the U.S. That's based on some of the positive collection trends that we've seen in India. Those receivables belong to us and is part of the $2.5 billion.\n We also converted 90% of the $200 million OCD, and then, we subsequently liquidated that right kind of during and after the successful FPO that VIL had done, which we were happy to see. So the 90% of the $200 million that we converted, we sold it into the market, and we realized a little over $200 million on that. So that's worked out really well.\n And again, I'll just highlight that it's achieving our original purpose, which is giving us multiple avenues to liquidate that receivable balance, increasing the probability of actually realizing cash, and it worked well. So we have over $200 million. We will -- you will see us remove that from India and bring it back to the U.S. as well. And on closing, you'll see the $2 billion plus any kind of ticking fee probably be paired up around closing just to give everyone the mechanics of those and what to expect in terms of the proceeds on closing. \nSimon Flannery: That's great. And any update on dividend policy beyond this year? \nSteven Vondran: Yes, what we've said is we plan to resume growth in 2025, subject to Board approval, and we'll give specifics on our Q4 call in February '25, as we always do, in terms of what that's going to look like. Over the long term, what you can think about is that our dividend per share and AFFO per share growth to be similar over the longer term. And so there may be some short-term changes in that.\n So for example, with our India divestiture, there will be some dilution in AFFO per share. So there might be a dislocation there from the AFFO per share growth and what we will see in taxable income. So over the long term, you can think about those being similar, but for 2025, in particular, we'll get more specific about that in February of next year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James. \nRic Prentiss: I want to follow up on Simon's question there on the dividend. I appreciate you can't give a lot of color there yet. But what kind of payout ratio are you trying to achieve that? Is it in like 100% of attributable AFFO per share? Was it more like 90% and the growth rate is going to be more on that long term, again Board decision? But is it more a payout ratio? Or is it an absolute level? Or is it growth that you're kind of pairing up dividend per share with attributable AFFO per share? \nSteven Vondran: Well, if we continue to grow it kind of in line with our AFFO per share growth, you can think of that payout ratio staying kind of in that 60% to 65% range. \nRodney Smith: I would just add to that quickly, Rick, to that 65% range. It does leave us between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of additional, let's say, AFFO to put towards other uses, either CapEx or anything else we want to do. So that ratio of that 60% to 65% kind of fits in well with giving us a lot of financial flexibility to invest capital. \nRic Prentiss: And It's a good thing not to pay it all out, leave yourselves some room to grow the business. Appreciate that. One question we get a lot. And Steve, you've talked to a lot on the call already, prepared remarks and questions of Michael and others, about U.S. green shoots, possibility of improvement. A lot of investors we talk to always look to like carrier CapEx. And you've pointed to it as well, \"I view carrier CapEx as an indicator, but not a perfect linear indicator of leasing. Can you help us understand how you look at carrier CapEx and why it may or may not be a perfect indicator to what can happen in any given quarter or a year on the leasing activity you see? \nSteven Vondran: Sure. I'm happy to. Thanks for the question, Rick. So when you look at carrier CapEx, first, I would point out that we're seeing -- the estimates for carrier CapEx and 5G are around that $35 billion, $36 billion per year mark on average. And that's up about $5 billion or $6 billion from what we saw in 4G, and that was up $5 billion or $6 billion from 3G. So we do see overall CapEx increasing.\n The reason it's not a perfect algorithm for growth on the tower side is that CapEx goes to a lot of different uses. It's not all going into the radio access network that goes on towers. Some of that CapEx goes into the core of the network and some of it goes to the fiber to connect the network. And so there's a lot of CapEx that's not related to just the rent on the sites. So it's not a perfect algorithm for that.\n And in fact, I think I'd point you to one of my customers' comments earlier this year where they said that their C-band deployments will continue at pace and that the savings that they're getting in their CapEx this year is coming from core and fiber. So when we think about carrier CapEx, what we're really trying to focus on is what we think the CapEx is going to be on the tower sites themselves.\n And while the carriers don't break that out specifically, that's where we take our market intelligence and what we're hearing from the teams on the ground to get a better idea from our perspective on what the activity is going to be based on what they're preparing to do on their sites. And so the CapEx does matter. If they're spending more CapEx, that does imply, generally speaking, more activity, less means less, but it's not a perfect algorithm. \nRic Prentiss: Sure. And back to another thing Michael pointed out, it seems to us also that, if you do see the shift from coverage and amendment activity to new lease activity and new co-locations, typically, your average rent is going to be higher, obviously, for a new lease than an amendment even though CapEx might not be very different than the carrier. Is that another possibility? \nSteven Vondran: Yes, that's a possibility, Rick. A new lease rate is typically higher than an amendment rate, but you get more amendments than you do new leases, so there's a little bit of a trade-off there. But look, it's all positive, and it's all the things that underpin our long-term guidance, and that's what our expectation for growth is. It's a combination of new leases and amendments as we go through a 5G cycle. It's a long cycle, and it's going to replicate very closely what we saw in 4G and 3G, and that's what we're seeing playing out today. \nRic Prentiss: Let me circle back, last one for me, Rod, you mentioned, obviously, you have excess cash that you can use for capital allocation, construction projects at new returns. But you would also think stock buyback comes into the equation at some point. I know you're trying to get to the 5.0. Help us understand the process getting through India and then what would trigger and allow you to think that stock buybacks are an available option given where the stock price is at. \nRodney Smith: Yes. It's a great question, Rick. And as we've -- as Steve and I have been saying really for the last couple of quarters, we are very focused on driving organic growth, very focused on driving operational efficiency, reducing our overall direct and SG&A cost to drive AFFO and AFFO per share growth where when it comes to capital allocation, we're very focused on delevering and strengthening our balance sheet and continuing momentum of adding CapEx and with the best projects that we see driving quality of earnings, the right risk profile, the right growth profile over the long term. So all that is clear and remains our focus.\n You did see we are at 5x this quarter in terms of net leverage. So we've achieved our goal for Q1. I'll point out, Rick, for you that, that was benefited by the payments that we saw in India and the absence of, let's say, the need for the reserve that we had in our outlook. So there is some timing benefits there that could be as much as $40 million, $45 million in Q1. What that means is we expect that leverage during the year will be back up above 5 slightly between now and the end of the year. And we're going to continue to work on getting that down to 5 in a sustainable way, and the goal is by the end of the year.\n Now we may not get there, but we'll be very close, I think, and we'll be in good shape. So with all that said, at some point, when we have leverage at our target range or below in a sustained fashion, then I think all options are on the table. At that point, we have regained full financial flexibility. In order to really engage in buybacks, I think we'd want to see more certainty around the economics, more certainty around issues of inflation and interest rates and those sorts of things.\n Today I think we all appreciate the fact that there is still a fair amount of uncertainty there, and we're going to be prudent in making sure our balance sheet is strong and that we are managing the business effectively to drive AFFO growth. That means reducing our floating rate debt, reducing our vulnerability, let's say, to changes in short-term rates. That's kind of the focus for this year.\n So I would say when you think about buybacks, Rick, it's probably more towards the end of this year, we'll be reassessing things. At that point, I think we'll be in a little bit different position when it comes to sustained leverage. Hopefully, by then, there's more certainty in the economic outlook and where interest rates are going. And at that point, we can do a full consideration of different allocation options. \nRic Prentiss: Well, I sure hope so more certainty and visibility. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: I guess my first question would just be related to foreign currency movements. We've been seeing some pretty extraordinary moves in the last 6 months, the Argentinian peso, the Nigerian naira, the -- even more recently the yen. Could you kind of share with us any evolution in your thinking around hedging and how that might be impacting your outlooks as you give them for the year?\n And then the second question would be, similarly, we seem to be at an inflection point maybe in fixed wireless access, some carriers getting more aggressive, some carriers getting less aggressive. Could you kind of share how you are looking at fixed wireless access, as an increasing contributor or a decreasing contributor to your growth outlook for the macro side? \nRodney Smith: David, thanks for the question. I'll hit the FX one, and then, I think Steve will take the one on fixed wireless. So when it comes to FX, you're absolutely right to point out, we do have some FX headwinds in the business. That's clear. This year, the FX headwinds that we're really seeing are coming through Africa, and primarily in Nigeria, which I think you're aware of. So when you look at outlook to outlook, we're down about $15 million in this guide on property revenue, just about $5 million on EBITDA and AFFO, which is about $0.01 dilution or headwind when it comes to the outlook adjustment there.\n And the puts and takes there, we've seen although for the year, year-on-year, we have an FX tailwind across Latin America. Outlook to outlook, there's a bit of a headwind that brewed up here in the first quarter. And then we have the opposite in Africa where we have a pretty significant headwind in FX across the region year-on-year, but outlook to outlook is actually a positive kind of tailwind in Africa. So not all currencies kind of move together. We certainly benefit at times more than others in terms of the portfolio effect where if one currency is under pressure, another one may be up a little bit.\n If you look at the spot rates, we actually could improve revs by about $17 million. It's too early to build that into our outlook, but that's what the spots would tell us. So from a hedging standpoint, I mean, one of the things that we've done is we've diversified our debt structure quite a bit in the last several years. And we're up now to about $7.5 billion of euro-denominated debt to kind of match up with our euro-based business that we have in Europe.\n The other thing I would say is the international businesses that we have, let's say, across Latin America and in Africa and in APAC, the cash flow that we generate there, we continue to kind of reinvest back in the business if we don't take it out through our intercompany lending. And of course, when you have devaluation, we're still operating in local currency in those markets.\n Our P&L is denominated in local currency. So all of the revenues and expenses are all in local currency. So a lot of it is translational. There isn't a lot of hedging that we can do or we think is prudent to do in Africa and Latin America. But reinvesting those cash flows back into assets in those regions, I think, is a pretty good long-term play in terms of creating value for our shareholders.\n But with that said, to the extent that we see any markets that have outsized FX headwinds, that certainly comes into our capital allocation thinking. And one of the benefits of our portfolio is it is very broad. And we don't have to invest capital in every country, every year. We can allocate it where it makes most sense for our shareholders and where it will create the most value, and we do that actively and dynamically.\n The other thing you've heard us say this before, David, we certainly build FX headwinds or FX impacts into our underwriting model. It's in all of our deals, so we do weighted average cost of capitals country by country. We also have the Fisher effect and expectation of inflation differentials between the foreign country as well as the U.S. currency that we invest in, and we build that in out over the long term within the model.\n So it's hard to get FX right on in the short term. But I think when you pull that out over a 20-, 30-year period, you have a much better chance of getting that right in the long-term model. So in terms of our underwriting over the long term, we still feel good about the portfolio that we have and our ability to handle the FX. But it is important to note that in the short term, we have the ability to lean in and out of different places depending on what's happening in FX, is one of those things that we would certainly be looking at. \nSteven Vondran: Yes. I would just add that we also use contractual mechanisms to also control it to some extent. It's very important for us to have CPI-linked escalators in all those international markets to make sure that you do recover some of the differential that you have from inflation from the U.S. in those markets. And in some markets, we also will have some of the revenues pegged to U.S. dollar. For example, in Nigeria, the -- about 40% of the revenue in Nigeria is passed through power.\n And so that's kind of passing through at the same rate that we're paying it, so that's a little bit of a natural hedge. The remaining 60%, about half of that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. That we get paid in naira, but it's pegged to whatever the exchange rate is when we go in there. So we do use contractual mechanisms to hedge as well. As well as what Rod said that most of our expenses are local currency expenses, so there's some natural hedge there as well.\n Fixed wireless, so on the fixed wireless side, look, we're seeing our carrier customers aggressively going into fixed wireless. And it's -- we've always said that it might be one of the first use cases in the 5G, and we're seeing that play out. I think the numbers are about 10 million subs that were at total for fixed wireless in the U.S. \n At this point, we're not seeing them deploy stand-alone fixed wireless networks by the major carriers. We do have stand-alone fixed wireless for some of the small guys, the WISPs and people like that. But at this point, the carriers continue to utilize the excess capacity they have in their current builds. What that means for the long term, I think it's too early to say. I'm encouraged by the ARPUs they're getting, the growth that they're seeing, the competitiveness that they're showing with the fixed-line broadband.\n And if those trends continue and if they're able to kind of underwrite some additional incremental network builds to support that, that would be upside to our base case. When we've set our long-term guide in the U.S., we were not anticipating any type of a stand-alone fixed wireless build or incremental network activity driven by fixed wireless. So that would be upside for us if it happens. But I think it's too early to tell right now if that's going to drive a lot of additional business or not. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. \nNicholas Del Deo: First on CoreSite, your MMR per cabinet growth has been really strong. Steve, you talked about that a little bit earlier. I guess can you help to decompose the drivers a bit more, how -- like-for-like pricing gains versus mix changes versus higher consumption per cabinet might be driving that.\n And you also noted that you had a record quarter for retail signings in the quarter. I guess more generally, can you comment on the mix of retail versus scale deals that you've had in recent periods and what's in your funnel today? \nSteven Vondran: Sure. Let me attack the first part of that. So when you look at pricing across our markets, what's really driving it is supply-demand dynamics. And so we're seeing similar increases and retail scale, hyperscale pricing in those markets. There's probably a little bit more increase in hyperscale at this point because contiguous capacity is becoming more rare and because they have the lowest pricing to begin with kind of in the markets. And so what we've seen across all of our markets is the supply is less than the demand.\n And part of that is just -- I think AI and other use cases have taken off faster than people expected. And the entire ecosystem has not provided as much capacity as what people are seeking. And that's really the underlying driver for what that pricing is happening in our facilities. Our funnel has a healthy mix of retail and scale. I don't have the exact breakdown at my fingertips. But a lot of that's driven by what capacity we have to sell and what use capacity is out there for some of the scale installations.\n And so, yes, depending on which facility and which market, we could be flexible in terms of what we offer people, and we can be selective on the customers. Because CoreSite is really the interconnection hub, it's not just a retail or co-location facility, we don't underwrite -- we don't write all the business that comes to us. We're not a low-cost provider per se in those markets. People come to us because of the interconnection we provide. And so we curate a mix, and we try to balance networks, cloud players and enterprises with a healthy mix of retail in a way that gives us the kind of industry-leading returns on our capital that CoreSite was delivering before we bought them and that we continue to use to underwrite our model there. \nNicholas Del Deo: Steve, have higher power densities influenced the MMR up for grab at all? Or is it more just the like-for-like pricing dynamic you described? \nSteven Vondran: I mean, certainly, look, we price the higher density cabinets more because they're taking up more power. So that does influence it. We did have a press release a couple of weeks ago about being NVIDIA certified in some of our facilities. And so certainly, when you're putting GPUs in versus CPUs, there's a pricing differential on that cabinet. But really what's driving the pricing increases across the board or the supply-demand dynamics? \nNicholas Del Deo: Okay. Okay. And then can I ask one on expenses? You've always run a pretty tight ship from that perspective. It seems like you're running even tighter than normal this year. I guess can you drill down into any of the specific actions you're taking to really help keep costs down. \nSteven Vondran: Sure. Let me give you kind of the backdrop to it, then I can give you a few examples. So over the last decade, we've been in a rapid growth mode in a lot of our markets. And when you're growing very quickly and you're buying and integrating assets, you're really focused on that piece of it and making sure that no balls drop and you're providing new customer service, et cetera. Now that we're not buying a lot of assets and integrating them, it's a good time for us to really focus on operational excellence.\n So across the board, what we're doing is we're looking at our operations and saying, \"How can we be better without negatively impacting customer service or the future of our business.\" So we're being very careful that we're not damaging the long-term trajectory of the business with it, but we are finding opportunities to do things more efficiently. \n And I would say what we're doing today is kind of Phase 1, and that each market is looking at what they can do on their own. And then there is an opportunity that we're focused on to more globalize the business, and that's taking best practices from each market in terms of what their expertise is and taking that to other markets to see if we can drive additional efficiencies there. For example, in the U.S., we've automated a lot of our processes. And the question that we're asking ourselves is, can we take those automations and use them internationally to drive even more efficiency there?\n In Africa, we are extremely efficient with how we use fuel in our Power as a Service business. So we're looking at that and saying, can we export those practices to other markets like the U.S. And so right now, we're being very deliberate and kind of chasing the low-hanging fruit that's just inherent in the business after coming off a decade of growth. And then we're going to be very thoughtful about continuing to look at those costs as we try to become as efficient as we can everywhere we can over time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. \nBatya Levi: Can you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in LatAm? I think the quarter came in a bit ahead of your outlook. An update on activity and maybe expected churn from or any exposure to its wireline business would be helpful.\n And just a second question on your build-to-suit program across regions. Any changes given the macro pressures or some regional risks that you're seeing? \nRodney Smith: Batya, this is Rod. I'll start with LatAm and give you a little insight on the trends there. So we're seeing for the outlook for 2024, LatAm is going to be coming in around 2% organic tenant billings growth. That's coming with about 3% being contributed via the co-location and amendment revenue. And if you put that up against prior year, it's pretty flat. So we're seeing a steady level of demand and activity across Latin America in that 3-ish percent for new business. The escalators are also in that 4%, so a touch above that. That's actually down kind of moderating because inflation across the region has come down.\n So last year, that was north of 7%. This year, it's about 4%. So that's a big driver of any headline change that you'll see. It's just a moderation of that inflation. The good news is we also are seeing a lower level of churn. So churn is about 5% in this year's guide. Last year, it was up closer to 6%. Within that 5% churn, almost half of it is coming from Oi, which I know you're familiar with that. It will take a couple of more years to kind of work through, and we will sort of get to the other side there. And then we would expect a more normalized overall growth will come back in the region. But it will take a couple of years before we get there.\n When you think about maybe just hitting the wireline side of Oi, you heard -- you probably saw a couple of comments come out publicly around the wireline of Oi and what they're doing. But I'll give you a couple of numbers here. They represent about $35 million to $40 million of revenue for us in our LatAm business. We did agree to about a 20% discount that is assumed in our outlook, so there's no negative impact to the outlook that we have out on the street based on that. That means that, that comes into about $7 million on a per-year basis over the next couple of years in terms of the discount.\n And as part of the transaction, we will also be taking ownership of certain sites down there from Oi. I'm not going to give you a count or any more detail there. We've got a little bit of work to do to look at that. But we have kind of worked through that. So we'll be working through the remaining churn down in LatAm. We do think it's temporary, but we also do think that you'll see kind of relatively low growth for the region for the next couple of years, let's say, lower single digits in that 3% -- 2% to 4% range, let's say. \nBatya Levi: That's helpful. And maybe just to build-to-suit update. \nRodney Smith: Yes. In terms of the build-to-suits, I mean, we're keeping that consistent up in the range of 2,000 to 2,500 to 3,500. Q1, the volumes were a little bit lower, but we do expect that to increase. We continue to see strong demand for us building towers for our customers across Africa and also in Europe. So we certainly have been happy with that.\n We're being fairly disciplined with the higher cost of capital, looking to make sure that pricing around build-to-suits reflects the new reality. But we still see several thousand sites that we can build every year. And I would say the volumes have come down a little bit. But one of the results of that is the quality, let's say, has increased because we're really being very selective on where we build, who we build for and what assets we build. As we look at the macro environment with the uncertainty around rates and cost of capital, we're being extremely disciplined. \nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of Jon Atkin from RBC. \nJonathan Atkin: Question about MLAs, maybe a 2-parter. To what extent do you use them internationally? I know a lot of it is paid by the drink, but maybe just update us on holistic MLAs and to what extent they're used internationally.\n And then as we look into maybe year-end '25, anything changing around the holistic portions of your domestic MLAs that roll off or even take effect? \nSteven Vondran: Sure. So when it comes to our international markets, we have a variety of contract structures, and sometimes, they depend on whether it's with an acquisition that we did or build-to-suits or a bigger part of the business there. So I would say there's a lot more variation in terms of how we construct our contracts internationally. We do have a couple of holistic type deals internationally. Again, a little bit different flavor than we would have in the U.S., but we do try to utilize those contract structures.\n Yes, I think that's something that may be an opportunity for us over time. But it takes time to get the customers to understand those. They're not typically used in a lot of those markets. And so kind of educating them on the benefits of those type structures and seeing the experience that our U.S. customers have had in terms of being able to continue to utilize those agreements and see value from them is something that may take some time.\n In terms of the U.S. agreements at the end of the year this year, there's nothing that we would point to you specifically on that, that we're talking about publicly at this point. So I would expect a ton of change there. \nJonathan Atkin: And any change into '25 given that these are often 5 years in duration? \nSteven Vondran: Well, look, it's a little early for us to be giving any type of guidance for 2025. But look, we think that our fundamental growth algorithm kind of holds true. And so when we look at 2025, we continue to see strong fundamentals in our business. That includes a continuation of solid U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth, even while we're still absorbing some headwinds associated with that final tranche of spread churn that happens in Q4 of this year.\n We see leasing volumes in Africa and Europe remaining positive with churn remaining low in Europe and an expectation for further moderation in China and Africa. Continued strong growth from CoreSite, especially as we're commencing those kind of record levels of new business that we've signed since the transaction was consummated. And we'll complement that topline growth with, again, continuing to focus on margin expansion and cost discipline and continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation.\n Now that growth can be a little bit offset by the headwinds we have in Latin America because we do see an elevated consolidation churn environment there for the next few years, and that's going to keep Latin America kind of in that low single-digit growth. \n And then again, when you think about 2025 and beyond, there's a lot of variables that we're keeping our eyes on, like FX rates, interest rates, services, is inherently harder to predict. So we won't be trying to guide anything on that until early next year.\n And then the timing of the India closing will also have an impact on what that AFFO per share growth rate is, although we think we've been very clear about what that means to us. I think most of our investors understand the variability on that with the timing. But all those kind of variables, we think, point to our long-term growth algorithm remaining strong in 2025 and beyond. \nAdam Smith: Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please feel free to reach out to myself or the IR team with any questions. And operator, we can close the call. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rodney Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We are off to a solid start to 2024 with Q1 performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. These results, together with the positive trends highlighted by Steve, the various initiatives we have in place to drive profitability and margin expansion and our optionality and discipline and selectively deploying capital towards projects yielding the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, give us confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth, quality of earnings and shareholder returns for 2024 and beyond.\n Before I dive into the results and our revised 2024 outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, the strong reoccurring fundamentals that underpin our business are again highlighted in our Q1 performance with consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.4% and another exceptional leasing quarter at CoreSite, including its highest quarter of retail new business signed since Q4 of 2020. Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate cost discipline resulting in strong year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I will touch on in a moment.\n Next, in India, the collection trends we saw in Q4 of 2023 continued into Q1, allowing us to reverse approximately $29 million of previously reserved revenue. Separately, while we continue to anticipate a second half 2024 closing on our sale of ATC India to Brookfield, we have already made progress in accelerating certain payments included in the potential $2.5 billion total proceeds associated with the transaction, including the repatriation of approximately $100 million net of withholding's tax back to the U.S. earlier this month.\n Additionally, we are making progress towards monetizing our optionally convertible debentures issued by VIL ahead of the anticipated closing of our India transaction. Executing the intended purpose of the debentures in serving as a liquid asset to backstop outstanding receivable balances, we expect to use the anticipated proceeds from the India sale to pay down existing indebtedness. We will continue to keep our shareholders informed as incremental progress is made towards the closing of our transaction. \n Finally, we successfully accessed the debt capital markets last month, issuing $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 5.3%, with proceeds used to pay down floating rate debt. \n Turning to first quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 6, consolidated property revenue growth was 3.3% or over 4.5% excluding noncash straight line revenue while absorbing roughly 100 basis points of FX headwinds. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was approximately 1.8% or over 4% excluding straight line, which includes over 1% impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 3.7% or roughly 6% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes a benefit associated with the improved collections in India, partially offset by the timing of the sale of our Mexico fiber business at the end of Q1 in 2023 and a reduction in Latin America termination fees as compared to the prior year.\n Finally, revenue in our Data Centers business increased by 10.6%, continuing the outperformance versus our initial underwriting plan as strong demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues and the backlog of record new business signed over the last 2 years begins to commence in a meaningful way. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, supported by strong demand across our global footprint. \n In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.6% and over 5.5% absent Sprint-related churn. As expected, growth in the quarter was slightly below our full-year guidance of 4.7%. As we lap modestly elevated churn that commenced in Q2 of 2023, we would expect Q2 and Q3 growth rates to each accelerate to roughly 5% before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation.\n Our International segment drove 6.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting an expected step down from the Q4 2023 rate of 7.7%, as we see moderation in CPI-linked escalators. Meanwhile, contributions from co-location and amendments remain strong with another sequential acceleration in Europe and a continuation of elevated contribution rates of around 8% in Africa.\n Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.2% or nearly 8% excluding the impacts of noncash straight line while absorbing 90 basis points in FX headwinds. Cash-adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 240 basis points year-over-year to 64.9% taking certain expense timing in India reserve benefits and further supported by our ongoing cost management focus. In fact, cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined approximately 5% year-over-year in Q1 and was down roughly 7% of our Q1 2022 levels.\n Additionally, gross margin from our U.S. services business came in just over $16 million, a decline of roughly 50% year-over-year, though representing an acceleration of nearly 70% of our Q4 2023 levels. This performance, together with the broad-based application pipeline buildup discussed by Steve in his prepared remarks, gives us confidence in our expectation for accelerating activity continuing through the duration of the year and is supportive of our full-year U.S. services outlook.\n Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 10% and 9.8%, respectively, supported by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. \n Now shifting to our revised full-year outlook. As I mentioned, we are pleased with the results to date and the sustainable demand trends underpinning our performance. However, given the close proximity to our previously released guidance, we have kept core full-year assumptions largely unchanged. With that in mind, our revised outlook includes several notable updates. \n First, we have taken the strong collections activity in India through the first quarter, which, as I mentioned earlier, resulted in approximately $29 million in revenue reserve reversals compared to approximately $16 million in revenue reserves assumed for Q1 in our prior outlook, resulting in a net benefit to plan of $45 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO.\n Reserve assumptions for April through December remained unchanged, resulting in a net reserve for the year of $20 million compared to the prior year outlook assumption of $65 million. Next, we have revised our FX assumptions for the year, resulting in a modest headwind compared to our prior outlook. \n Finally, while our net interest assumptions remain relatively unchanged, we have increased our interest expense due to elevated rates, which was partially offset by modest interest expense reductions through a reduced debt balance attributed to the accelerated India proceeds I mentioned earlier and further offset by higher interest income.\n With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $30 million compared to prior outlook, driven by $45 million of upside related to the positive collections in India during the first quarter, partially offset by $15 million associated with negative FX impacts. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across all regions, including approximately 4.7% in the U.S. and Canada, 11% to 12% in Africa, 5% to 6% in Europe and 2% in both LatAm and APAC, collectively driving approximately 5% for international and 5% on a consolidated basis. We will continue to assess our first quarter momentum as we work through the year.\n Turning to Slide 9. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $40 million as compared to prior outlook, driven by the flow-through of the revised revenue reserve assumptions in India, partially offset by $5 million of FX headwinds.\n Moving to Slide 10. We are similarly raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.42, supported by the revised Indian reserve assumption benefits, partially offset by FX. As I mentioned, although we are raising expectations for interest expense, it is offset on a net basis by a similar increase in interest income.\n Turning to Slide 11. We are reiterating our capital allocation plans for 2024, which is focused on selectively funding projects we expect to drive the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, sustained growth and quality of earnings, executing on an accelerated pathway to balance sheet strength and financial flexibility and delivering an attractive total shareholder return profile as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. This includes maintaining a relatively flat annual common dividend declaration of $6.48 per share or approximately $3 billion in 2024, with an expectation to resume growth again in 2025, all subject to Board approval. \n Moving to the right side of the slide, our disciplined approach to capital allocation, together with recurring topline growth and its high conversion to profitability through cost management, all support the progress we've made to achieving our goal of 5x net leverage by the end of the year. While our Q1 net leverage already stands at 5x, it is important to note that the metric for this quarter benefits from the Indian reserve reversals previously mentioned, and we'd expect to be above 5x in Q2. These efforts, combined with our successful capital markets execution year-to-date, have further reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet as a strategic asset, which will remain a key focus moving forward.\n Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are off to a great start to 2024. Our visibility into a solid foundation of recurring contracted growth across our global business combined with an accelerating pipeline supporting our expectations for future activity, a keen focus on cost discipline and margin expansion and a continued demonstration of strategically deploying capital while enhancing balance sheet strength, gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth over the long term for our shareholders while being a best-in-class operator for our stakeholders globally.\n With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Matt, this is Rod. If I could just add briefly here 1 or 2 comments. So of course, as Steve said, we've had record levels of new business in the past. And what that is leading to is higher revenue growth now as we're delivering that new business that we signed up over the last couple of years. So you saw in the quarter, we had a north of 10% revenue growth rate. As I said in my prepared remarks, that is the result of delivering on that new business, those record levels of new business we signed up over the last couple of years.\n The last couple of years of new business has also led to a high level of backlog. So we're up in the close to $60 million in terms of backlog, which is signed deals that we haven't commenced into revenue yet. That's up from a run rate of being closer to $40 million or $45 million in the last couple of years. So that the new business we sign up, it translates into backlog and then it translates into revenue and revenue growth. So with the activity level we've seen in the last couple of years, the high backlog we have today, that positions CoreSite very well to have high levels of growth over the next couple of years. Simon, this is Rod. Simon, I'm going to add a couple of comments on India just to give everyone listening a couple of the numbers and a reminder. So as Steve said, the timing is still second half of this year. Everything is going well, certainly within our expectation. I just want to remind everyone that we announced when we signed a deal with Brookfield to sell 100% of India that it would have total proceeds that could be up to $2.5 billion. That comes in a couple of different forms. It will be $2 billion in terms of the -- let's call it, the purchase price, which includes the intercompany debt that we have in there as well as the term loan that we have in India. \n The intercompany debt is little less than $0.5 billion, and then, the term loan is about $120 million. It also includes some working capital, some receivables and the OCD that I'm sure you're familiar with that we put in place with VIL. So the OCD was about $200 million. The other India receivables was a little less than about $200 million. And then there's also a ticking fee component that we get that is based on the mechanics between signing and closing.\n You put all those things together, it comes up to about $2.5 billion. We are in the process of realizing and taking some of these proceeds out of India. So you did see -- and you'll see in the details, we removed about $100 million from India and took it back to the U.S. That's based on some of the positive collection trends that we've seen in India. Those receivables belong to us and is part of the $2.5 billion.\n We also converted 90% of the $200 million OCD, and then, we subsequently liquidated that right kind of during and after the successful FPO that VIL had done, which we were happy to see. So the 90% of the $200 million that we converted, we sold it into the market, and we realized a little over $200 million on that. So that's worked out really well.\n And again, I'll just highlight that it's achieving our original purpose, which is giving us multiple avenues to liquidate that receivable balance, increasing the probability of actually realizing cash, and it worked well. So we have over $200 million. We will -- you will see us remove that from India and bring it back to the U.S. as well. And on closing, you'll see the $2 billion plus any kind of ticking fee probably be paired up around closing just to give everyone the mechanics of those and what to expect in terms of the proceeds on closing. I would just add to that quickly, Rick, to that 65% range. It does leave us between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of additional, let's say, AFFO to put towards other uses, either CapEx or anything else we want to do. So that ratio of that 60% to 65% kind of fits in well with giving us a lot of financial flexibility to invest capital. Yes. It's a great question, Rick. And as we've -- as Steve and I have been saying really for the last couple of quarters, we are very focused on driving organic growth, very focused on driving operational efficiency, reducing our overall direct and SG&A cost to drive AFFO and AFFO per share growth where when it comes to capital allocation, we're very focused on delevering and strengthening our balance sheet and continuing momentum of adding CapEx and with the best projects that we see driving quality of earnings, the right risk profile, the right growth profile over the long term. So all that is clear and remains our focus.\n You did see we are at 5x this quarter in terms of net leverage. So we've achieved our goal for Q1. I'll point out, Rick, for you that, that was benefited by the payments that we saw in India and the absence of, let's say, the need for the reserve that we had in our outlook. So there is some timing benefits there that could be as much as $40 million, $45 million in Q1. What that means is we expect that leverage during the year will be back up above 5 slightly between now and the end of the year. And we're going to continue to work on getting that down to 5 in a sustainable way, and the goal is by the end of the year.\n Now we may not get there, but we'll be very close, I think, and we'll be in good shape. So with all that said, at some point, when we have leverage at our target range or below in a sustained fashion, then I think all options are on the table. At that point, we have regained full financial flexibility. In order to really engage in buybacks, I think we'd want to see more certainty around the economics, more certainty around issues of inflation and interest rates and those sorts of things.\n Today I think we all appreciate the fact that there is still a fair amount of uncertainty there, and we're going to be prudent in making sure our balance sheet is strong and that we are managing the business effectively to drive AFFO growth. That means reducing our floating rate debt, reducing our vulnerability, let's say, to changes in short-term rates. That's kind of the focus for this year.\n So I would say when you think about buybacks, Rick, it's probably more towards the end of this year, we'll be reassessing things. At that point, I think we'll be in a little bit different position when it comes to sustained leverage. Hopefully, by then, there's more certainty in the economic outlook and where interest rates are going. And at that point, we can do a full consideration of different allocation options. David, thanks for the question. I'll hit the FX one, and then, I think Steve will take the one on fixed wireless. So when it comes to FX, you're absolutely right to point out, we do have some FX headwinds in the business. That's clear. This year, the FX headwinds that we're really seeing are coming through Africa, and primarily in Nigeria, which I think you're aware of. So when you look at outlook to outlook, we're down about $15 million in this guide on property revenue, just about $5 million on EBITDA and AFFO, which is about $0.01 dilution or headwind when it comes to the outlook adjustment there.\n And the puts and takes there, we've seen although for the year, year-on-year, we have an FX tailwind across Latin America. Outlook to outlook, there's a bit of a headwind that brewed up here in the first quarter. And then we have the opposite in Africa where we have a pretty significant headwind in FX across the region year-on-year, but outlook to outlook is actually a positive kind of tailwind in Africa. So not all currencies kind of move together. We certainly benefit at times more than others in terms of the portfolio effect where if one currency is under pressure, another one may be up a little bit.\n If you look at the spot rates, we actually could improve revs by about $17 million. It's too early to build that into our outlook, but that's what the spots would tell us. So from a hedging standpoint, I mean, one of the things that we've done is we've diversified our debt structure quite a bit in the last several years. And we're up now to about $7.5 billion of euro-denominated debt to kind of match up with our euro-based business that we have in Europe.\n The other thing I would say is the international businesses that we have, let's say, across Latin America and in Africa and in APAC, the cash flow that we generate there, we continue to kind of reinvest back in the business if we don't take it out through our intercompany lending. And of course, when you have devaluation, we're still operating in local currency in those markets.\n Our P&L is denominated in local currency. So all of the revenues and expenses are all in local currency. So a lot of it is translational. There isn't a lot of hedging that we can do or we think is prudent to do in Africa and Latin America. But reinvesting those cash flows back into assets in those regions, I think, is a pretty good long-term play in terms of creating value for our shareholders.\n But with that said, to the extent that we see any markets that have outsized FX headwinds, that certainly comes into our capital allocation thinking. And one of the benefits of our portfolio is it is very broad. And we don't have to invest capital in every country, every year. We can allocate it where it makes most sense for our shareholders and where it will create the most value, and we do that actively and dynamically.\n The other thing you've heard us say this before, David, we certainly build FX headwinds or FX impacts into our underwriting model. It's in all of our deals, so we do weighted average cost of capitals country by country. We also have the Fisher effect and expectation of inflation differentials between the foreign country as well as the U.S. currency that we invest in, and we build that in out over the long term within the model.\n So it's hard to get FX right on in the short term. But I think when you pull that out over a 20-, 30-year period, you have a much better chance of getting that right in the long-term model. So in terms of our underwriting over the long term, we still feel good about the portfolio that we have and our ability to handle the FX. But it is important to note that in the short term, we have the ability to lean in and out of different places depending on what's happening in FX, is one of those things that we would certainly be looking at. Batya, this is Rod. I'll start with LatAm and give you a little insight on the trends there. So we're seeing for the outlook for 2024, LatAm is going to be coming in around 2% organic tenant billings growth. That's coming with about 3% being contributed via the co-location and amendment revenue. And if you put that up against prior year, it's pretty flat. So we're seeing a steady level of demand and activity across Latin America in that 3-ish percent for new business. The escalators are also in that 4%, so a touch above that. That's actually down kind of moderating because inflation across the region has come down.\n So last year, that was north of 7%. This year, it's about 4%. So that's a big driver of any headline change that you'll see. It's just a moderation of that inflation. The good news is we also are seeing a lower level of churn. So churn is about 5% in this year's guide. Last year, it was up closer to 6%. Within that 5% churn, almost half of it is coming from Oi, which I know you're familiar with that. It will take a couple of more years to kind of work through, and we will sort of get to the other side there. And then we would expect a more normalized overall growth will come back in the region. But it will take a couple of years before we get there.\n When you think about maybe just hitting the wireline side of Oi, you heard -- you probably saw a couple of comments come out publicly around the wireline of Oi and what they're doing. But I'll give you a couple of numbers here. They represent about $35 million to $40 million of revenue for us in our LatAm business. We did agree to about a 20% discount that is assumed in our outlook, so there's no negative impact to the outlook that we have out on the street based on that. That means that, that comes into about $7 million on a per-year basis over the next couple of years in terms of the discount.\n And as part of the transaction, we will also be taking ownership of certain sites down there from Oi. I'm not going to give you a count or any more detail there. We've got a little bit of work to do to look at that. But we have kind of worked through that. So we'll be working through the remaining churn down in LatAm. We do think it's temporary, but we also do think that you'll see kind of relatively low growth for the region for the next couple of years, let's say, lower single digits in that 3% -- 2% to 4% range, let's say. Yes. In terms of the build-to-suits, I mean, we're keeping that consistent up in the range of 2,000 to 2,500 to 3,500. Q1, the volumes were a little bit lower, but we do expect that to increase. We continue to see strong demand for us building towers for our customers across Africa and also in Europe. So we certainly have been happy with that.\n We're being fairly disciplined with the higher cost of capital, looking to make sure that pricing around build-to-suits reflects the new reality. But we still see several thousand sites that we can build every year. And I would say the volumes have come down a little bit. But one of the results of that is the quality, let's say, has increased because we're really being very selective on where we build, who we build for and what assets we build. As we look at the macro environment with the uncertainty around rates and cost of capital, we're being extremely disciplined."

            "name": "Steven Vondran",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in the results we reported this morning, mobile network upgrades and digital transformation trends are driving compelling demand across our tower and data center platforms. 5G rollouts are contributing to an acceleration in our U.S. application pipeline and another sequential step up in co-location and amendment growth in Europe.\n Solid demand in Africa continue to drive elevating business growth, and retail demand resulted in another quarter of strong sales performance at CoreSite, which you'll hear more about later on. Before handing the call over to Rod, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the key factors that have driven performance in our U.S. and Canada tower business and underpin the evaluation and execution of our global expansion strategy.\n In particular, we believe that our focus on asset quality, operational excellence and contract structures, all through the prism of long-term value creation, have been the most critical factors in determining our ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption and our ability to drive leading performance on our assets over multiple network investment cycles.\n Over the last 25 years, we've developed a scaled nationwide portfolio of approximately 43,000 sites across the U.S. and Canada. This portfolio has been methodically constructed, primarily through the acquisition of high-quality carrier design and constructive tower portfolios, of which nationwide networks have been built and expanded upon through each successive G and have further benefited from the transition to neutral-host operation.\n We've complemented the acquisition of these target assets with select high-quality independent tower provider portfolios, smaller tuck-in portfolios and build-to-suit sites, which taken together represent meaningful scale. Our ability to be highly selective in the assets that we've aggressively pursued for acquisition and development, the assets we've chosen not to pursue and the standards we've used to underwrite our growth are the result of robust internal analysis and due diligence capabilities that rely on data insights that we've accumulated through our history as a tower operator.\n These insights have reinforced our understanding of the asset location, competition considerations and structural dynamics come together to create the potential for differentiated value creation. For example, our focus on high-quality assets in premier locations has resulted in a portfolio that's geographically skewed towards suburban and rural environments and transport corridors where the vast majority of Americans live and travel as well as towers that are structurally designed for co-tenancy, which we believe has enabled us to generate leading new business growth on our assets.\n Similarly, by focusing our assets on significant structural capacity, we believe we can reduce overall operating and redevelopment costs allowing for profit and return maximization at the asset level at industry best speed to market for carrier deployments on our towers.\n We are seeing these factors come together to result in significant value creation on our assets. Notably, cash operating profit margins for our U.S. and Canada Property segment have expanded by over 420 basis points since 2016, the year following our Verizon transaction in the U.S. As we continue to focus on driving more new business and efficiency at the asset level, we see a path to further increasing the profitability of our U.S. and Canada business going forward.\n Turning to our operating model. Through our focus on efficiency and delivering exceptional value for customers, we've invested in technology and then build up of capabilities that we believe enhance the service we provide our customers as a value of our product offering. For example, through our application services automation programs, we've continuously reduced cycle times, further supporting critical speed-to-market advantages for our customers, which translates into accelerated revenue realization for our business. \n Elsewhere in our Services segment, we've combined investments in data quality and governance with the development of internal data platforms to improve our overall service offerings and asset integrity. Over time, customer feedback shows that these investments have resulted in a consistent upward trajectory in customer satisfaction, achieved by providing a differentiated customer experience of high asset integrity.\n In our land management operations, we're also taking approach that's focused on our customers' needs and expanding the profitability of our sites. Through our Tower Asset Protection Program, we performed thousands of transactions a year that improved the ground rights and eased site access conditions, a critical factor for our customers. And over the last decade, we've deployed significant capital at attractive rates of return and admitted thousands of contracts to protect our assets and mitigate growth in land rent, supporting margin performance.\n Finally, as we've said publicly many times, contract terms and structure are critical to realizing the full value of the assets we only manage. And our approach has been centered around creating long-term value for American Tower and our carrier customers, even when it can potentially come at the expense of short-term wins.\n Perhaps the most important capability we've built internally over the last 2 decades is knowing our assets and understanding their value. As a result, we've been able to achieve outstanding growth and create significant shareholder value at our traditional MLA agreement, while also developing innovative structures such as the comprehensive MLA. \n Under these agreements, we're able to secure guaranteed growth over a multiyear period in a way that maximizes the value of our assets while providing a degree of insulation from quarter-to-quarter ebbs and flows in wireless network spending. Critically, we've seen that these contracts represented a compelling value proposition for our carrier customers.\n By lowering their total cost of ownership when compared to self-performance, by providing a framework to leverage our skill for their networks that translates to budgetary operational visibility and by creating administrative efficiencies that yield lower transaction costs on sell-side deployments.\n Taking all this together, we've seen this focus on the right assets, high-quality contracts with operational excellence facilitate increasing monetization and growth in mobile data consumption and corresponding carrier's CapEx increases over time.\n Over the course of the 4G investment cycle between 2010 and 2018, average mobile data consumption for smartphone increased from less than 100 megawatts per month to 7 gigabytes per month. And over that period, carriers were deploying approximately $29 billion annually on average, up from approximately $23 billion during 3G.\n As we have moved into the 5G investment cycle, for early 2019 till today, we've once again seen mobile data consumption for smartphone grow to almost 30 gigabytes per month in 2024. We've seen early 5G subscribers consuming roughly 2x the mobile data compared to the average 4G subscriber. And we see average annual carrier CapEx step up to approximately $36 billion a year.\n This CapEx investment translated to the approximately $230 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growths we delivered last year, much of which was attributed to 5G activity as well as an expectation for growth on a per-site basis in 2024 that significantly exceeds the average seen during the 4G deployment cycle. That brings us to today, where we continue to see all of our key customers actively working on network upgrades and rollouts and the 5G cycle playing out in line with the broader expectations underwritten our long-term guidance. \n On our last call, we indicated that we expected a year-over-year increase in contributions for our Services segment due in part to early indications of uptick in our application pipeline as well as conversations that our teams were having with our customers on the ground. The activity we saw in Q1 reinforces that expectation. Specifically, contributions in our Services segment for the quarter came in ahead of our internal expectations. And on the application side, Q1 volume was over 70% higher than what we saw in Q4 of last year. In fact, March represented the highest volume level over the trailing 12 months. It was supported by broad-based step-ups across our major U.S. customers. \n Now while there's only some level of risk associated with our expectations in the Services segment, I'm pleased to say that what we've seen thus far supports the 2024 guidance we provided in February, including approximately $195 million, the expected services revenue contributions; approximately 4.7% organic tenant billings growth at $180 million to $190 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growth, one of our strongest years to date.\n So as we move forward, we believe our U.S. tower portfolio is uniquely positioned to continue driving compelling growth as 5G expected increases in mobile data consumption and associated carrier investments driving increasing demand for our assets over time.\n Importantly, by leveraging that same expertise to develop our leading global portfolio, we're well positioned to monetize similar trends across our global footprint, while delivering a differentiated experience and value proposition to our customers.\n Further, we believe the factors that we're taking in through today as well as the global focus on increasing efficiency in our cost structure provide a path to continue converting topline growth at a rate that expands already attractive cash operating profit margins and creates incremental shareholder value. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q1 performance and our updated outlook. Rod? Sure. Thanks for the question. In the U.S., again, we're seeing an acceleration in Q1 relative to Q4. And our application pipeline coming in, in Q1 was about 70% higher than Q4. And our services gross margin came in at about $16 million in the quarter, which was higher than we had expected. So what we're seeing is an acceleration in activity that really underpins the guidance that we gave last quarter. And just to kind of reiterate what that is, on our services, we're expecting our services about $195 million in revenue, about $100 million in gross margin.\n And look, while that services is inherently hard to predict sometimes, the activity we're seeing in Q1 along with the conversations we're having with kind of the boots on the ground teams from our customers, that gives us confidence that we're going to hit that services guide for the year. And so we'll continue to watch it and see how that cadence goes throughout the rest of the year. But everything we're seeing in Q1 gives us some optimism there.\n When it comes to our property revenue growth from that, again, I'll remind you that a lot of our revenue assumptions are underpinned by our comprehensive MLAs. So at this point, the acceleration that we're seeing in growth, that doesn't change our guidance in terms of what we're expecting to see in the U.S. Again, I'll reiterate that. We're expecting to see organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% in the U.S. And that will be a little bit different quarter-by-quarter.\n In Q1, it was 4.6%. And I will expect that to go up a little bit in the middle of the year and then the final tranche of Sprint churn that hits in October, we'll weigh that down a bit in Q4. But overall, we're encouraged by that. In terms of what we're seeing, it is fairly broad-based. I don't want to get into individual customer activity levels, but we are seeing some broad-based activity pick up in the U.S. with all of our major customers. And again, we're encouraged that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year.\n When it comes to CoreSite, yes, we have 2 years of kind of record sales and we have a healthy pipeline this year. And we've got a tough comp compared to last year. So I don't know that we'll achieve another record year of sales, but we're hoping. And we did have a very strong quarter on retail this year, and that was really exciting to see.\n In terms of the headwinds for that business, we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. Again, what's underpinning the growth in CoreSite right now, the bulk of that growth is being driven by enterprises that are going to hybrid cloud IT infrastructure. And there's a long tail event that we see out there. There's still a lot of companies that have their own data centers, and there are a lot of companies that went cloud native or that had moved everything to the cloud, and they're looking for a different cost structure, and they're going to this hybrid environment. And that's still the biggest driver we have, and we see a very, very long tail of that activity out there.\n We are seeing an uptick in activity from AI. In particular, the inferencing portion of AI models is kind of perfectly suited for CoreSite. You're going to have these large learning models that are done in the big hyperscale data centers, but when you start interfacing with the users to provide that data to them and also get the inputs from them, you need a distribution channel. And CoreSite is perfectly suited to provide that type of distribution. So we are seeing some activity there.\n In terms of kind of industry headwinds, we're not seeing a falloff in our funnel today. We're watching it just like everyone else is. Some of the things that people have highlighted, some of the demand and the supply issues are things that actually drive pricing up, so where we have markets that are constrained supplied, that's actually driving pricing up. We've got more megawatts under construction today than we ever had before at CoreSite, so we're planning for that demand cycle to continue. But I'll just reiterate that a large portion of that is pre-leased, more than we ever have before.\n In fact, our pre-leasing percentage right now of the stuff that we have under construction is about 35%. And that's down a tick from last quarter because we've placed some things in service, but we're still seeing healthy demand for pre-leasing, and we'll continue to explore that as well. \n We're still seeing growth in interconnect, and I know that there's been some discussion out there about grooming of cross connects. And that's something that we constantly see with customers as they're trying to optimize our cost structure. But even with a little bit of grooming going on, we're still seeing healthy growth there. \n So again, I think we're very optimistic about the demand for CoreSite, the pipeline that we're seeing, hoping for another record year of sales, but that's a tough comp. So I'm sure my sales team is cringing hearing me say that, but we feel good about it. And we're not seeing headwinds weigh on it today. But again, we're watching the market just like everybody else is, and we'll be appropriately cautious if we see that demand slowing down. But that's not what we're seeing from our sales teams today. Sure. Thanks for the question. So what we're seeing in the U.S., it's clearly -- it's 1 quarter results. And again, the conversations that we're having give us the optimism that our guide for the year is kind of spot on in terms of the customer is starting to ramp up. I don't have a lot of visibility into what my competitors are seeing. So I don't think I can give an opinion on whether what we're seeing is materially different than what they're seeing.\n But when I reflect on what the customers need to do to complete their mid-band 5G rollouts and when I think about what their long-term goals are on their network, there's a lot of work yet to be done. So what I think that we're seeing play out is the same cycle we saw in 4G, the same cycle we saw in 3G, where there's an initial push, then there's a little bit of a slowdown while they're optimizing their network and then there's another push. And I think that we're starting to see that.\n Now where I do think we've really differentiated ourselves is that our MLAs do provide a little bit of an easy button for our customers, and we're able to give them great speed to market, great cost predictability. And I think that, that does give us greater market share over time. \n Back to kind of our longer-term guide for the U.S., just to remind everyone, we said that we expect at least 5% organic tenant billings growth on average for the period between 2023 and 2027, and that would be 6% excluding the Sprint churn that we have. And in 2023, that OTBG number was 5.3%, and we're projecting 4.7% this year. And that's all while we're absorbing greater than 100 basis points of Sprint churn a year in each of those years. So we see the activity levels very supportive of that long-term guide.\n And again, we feel good about the cycle of 5G. We feel good about the carrier activity that we're seeing and about the way 5G is performing in terms of giving them megabytes of data or gigabytes of data a lot cheaper than they could produce it any other way. A little bit. Again, I think when you think about these cycles that the carriers build in, the first push that you see is always a coverage network and that implies overlays on existing sites. And then, when they slow down and start optimizing, part of that optimization is infill to get better quality of service where they might have some coverage gaps or might not be getting the optimal service. And that always implies more co-locations. So we are seeing some demand for that as well.\n Again, we're -- we see some kind of broad-based activity, so it's -- we're seeing both, and we're seeing that across the carriers. And again, I would just remind folks that we do have comprehensive MLAs in place with some of our customers that smooth out some of those cycles of the ups and downs of the activity levels. We did disclose in Q1 that one of our major customers rolled off of their comprehensive MLAs. And so for that customer, when you come off the comprehensive portion and get to more of the kind of pay by the drink, there is more seasonality in terms of the commencement of those leases as they sign them. And so from that perspective, activity levels will drive the -- that portion of our business, more than they do for the ones that are in the comprehensive MLAs. Yes. Sure. I'll start with India. No updates at this point. It's very hard to predict when that approval will come through. So we're still expecting second half of the year. But we'll let you know as soon as we know what's happening on that.\n In terms of broader M&A, our team is looking at everything that's kind of out there for sale. And that's just part of our standard practice. There's nothing that we're seeing that's compelling that would take us off of our capital allocation priorities that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and that is our first priority of any of our capital allocations paying our dividend, but then we're really focused on delevering after that, making sure we get down to our 5x net leverage.\n And so when we're looking at the M&A that's out there, there's nothing that we're seeing today that is strategically important or at the right price that would make us change our mind on that at this point.\n When it comes to our own portfolio, and I just want to be clear about this, we're not doing a strategic review specifically, if anything, meaning there's nothing that we're intending to sell out there today. Having said that, we do have some businesses that may not be as strategic for us or they may not be at scale. And if the right buyer with the right price came along, we would consider something there. But as we look at our portfolio kind of across the globe, our goal is to figure out if there are businesses that are not meeting our original underwriting criteria.\n The first thing is what can we do to fix those, how do we drive greater sales, how do we get more efficiency in the market to drive margins up? And we'll try that first. If we decided to exit other market, they'd have to be because we're getting the right price and that we think it's more accretive to our shareholders than holding it. So at this point, there's nothing to point to in our portfolio that we're actively looking to dispose of. But again, there are some nonstrategic businesses for us out there that we would consider if the right buyer and the right price came along. Yes, what we've said is we plan to resume growth in 2025, subject to Board approval, and we'll give specifics on our Q4 call in February '25, as we always do, in terms of what that's going to look like. Over the long term, what you can think about is that our dividend per share and AFFO per share growth to be similar over the longer term. And so there may be some short-term changes in that.\n So for example, with our India divestiture, there will be some dilution in AFFO per share. So there might be a dislocation there from the AFFO per share growth and what we will see in taxable income. So over the long term, you can think about those being similar, but for 2025, in particular, we'll get more specific about that in February of next year. Well, if we continue to grow it kind of in line with our AFFO per share growth, you can think of that payout ratio staying kind of in that 60% to 65% range. Sure. I'm happy to. Thanks for the question, Rick. So when you look at carrier CapEx, first, I would point out that we're seeing -- the estimates for carrier CapEx and 5G are around that $35 billion, $36 billion per year mark on average. And that's up about $5 billion or $6 billion from what we saw in 4G, and that was up $5 billion or $6 billion from 3G. So we do see overall CapEx increasing.\n The reason it's not a perfect algorithm for growth on the tower side is that CapEx goes to a lot of different uses. It's not all going into the radio access network that goes on towers. Some of that CapEx goes into the core of the network and some of it goes to the fiber to connect the network. And so there's a lot of CapEx that's not related to just the rent on the sites. So it's not a perfect algorithm for that.\n And in fact, I think I'd point you to one of my customers' comments earlier this year where they said that their C-band deployments will continue at pace and that the savings that they're getting in their CapEx this year is coming from core and fiber. So when we think about carrier CapEx, what we're really trying to focus on is what we think the CapEx is going to be on the tower sites themselves.\n And while the carriers don't break that out specifically, that's where we take our market intelligence and what we're hearing from the teams on the ground to get a better idea from our perspective on what the activity is going to be based on what they're preparing to do on their sites. And so the CapEx does matter. If they're spending more CapEx, that does imply, generally speaking, more activity, less means less, but it's not a perfect algorithm. Yes, that's a possibility, Rick. A new lease rate is typically higher than an amendment rate, but you get more amendments than you do new leases, so there's a little bit of a trade-off there. But look, it's all positive, and it's all the things that underpin our long-term guidance, and that's what our expectation for growth is. It's a combination of new leases and amendments as we go through a 5G cycle. It's a long cycle, and it's going to replicate very closely what we saw in 4G and 3G, and that's what we're seeing playing out today. Yes. I would just add that we also use contractual mechanisms to also control it to some extent. It's very important for us to have CPI-linked escalators in all those international markets to make sure that you do recover some of the differential that you have from inflation from the U.S. in those markets. And in some markets, we also will have some of the revenues pegged to U.S. dollar. For example, in Nigeria, the -- about 40% of the revenue in Nigeria is passed through power.\n And so that's kind of passing through at the same rate that we're paying it, so that's a little bit of a natural hedge. The remaining 60%, about half of that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. That we get paid in naira, but it's pegged to whatever the exchange rate is when we go in there. So we do use contractual mechanisms to hedge as well. As well as what Rod said that most of our expenses are local currency expenses, so there's some natural hedge there as well.\n Fixed wireless, so on the fixed wireless side, look, we're seeing our carrier customers aggressively going into fixed wireless. And it's -- we've always said that it might be one of the first use cases in the 5G, and we're seeing that play out. I think the numbers are about 10 million subs that were at total for fixed wireless in the U.S. \n At this point, we're not seeing them deploy stand-alone fixed wireless networks by the major carriers. We do have stand-alone fixed wireless for some of the small guys, the WISPs and people like that. But at this point, the carriers continue to utilize the excess capacity they have in their current builds. What that means for the long term, I think it's too early to say. I'm encouraged by the ARPUs they're getting, the growth that they're seeing, the competitiveness that they're showing with the fixed-line broadband.\n And if those trends continue and if they're able to kind of underwrite some additional incremental network builds to support that, that would be upside to our base case. When we've set our long-term guide in the U.S., we were not anticipating any type of a stand-alone fixed wireless build or incremental network activity driven by fixed wireless. So that would be upside for us if it happens. But I think it's too early to tell right now if that's going to drive a lot of additional business or not. Sure. Let me attack the first part of that. So when you look at pricing across our markets, what's really driving it is supply-demand dynamics. And so we're seeing similar increases and retail scale, hyperscale pricing in those markets. There's probably a little bit more increase in hyperscale at this point because contiguous capacity is becoming more rare and because they have the lowest pricing to begin with kind of in the markets. And so what we've seen across all of our markets is the supply is less than the demand.\n And part of that is just -- I think AI and other use cases have taken off faster than people expected. And the entire ecosystem has not provided as much capacity as what people are seeking. And that's really the underlying driver for what that pricing is happening in our facilities. Our funnel has a healthy mix of retail and scale. I don't have the exact breakdown at my fingertips. But a lot of that's driven by what capacity we have to sell and what use capacity is out there for some of the scale installations.\n And so, yes, depending on which facility and which market, we could be flexible in terms of what we offer people, and we can be selective on the customers. Because CoreSite is really the interconnection hub, it's not just a retail or co-location facility, we don't underwrite -- we don't write all the business that comes to us. We're not a low-cost provider per se in those markets. People come to us because of the interconnection we provide. And so we curate a mix, and we try to balance networks, cloud players and enterprises with a healthy mix of retail in a way that gives us the kind of industry-leading returns on our capital that CoreSite was delivering before we bought them and that we continue to use to underwrite our model there. I mean, certainly, look, we price the higher density cabinets more because they're taking up more power. So that does influence it. We did have a press release a couple of weeks ago about being NVIDIA certified in some of our facilities. And so certainly, when you're putting GPUs in versus CPUs, there's a pricing differential on that cabinet. But really what's driving the pricing increases across the board or the supply-demand dynamics? Sure. Let me give you kind of the backdrop to it, then I can give you a few examples. So over the last decade, we've been in a rapid growth mode in a lot of our markets. And when you're growing very quickly and you're buying and integrating assets, you're really focused on that piece of it and making sure that no balls drop and you're providing new customer service, et cetera. Now that we're not buying a lot of assets and integrating them, it's a good time for us to really focus on operational excellence.\n So across the board, what we're doing is we're looking at our operations and saying, \"How can we be better without negatively impacting customer service or the future of our business.\" So we're being very careful that we're not damaging the long-term trajectory of the business with it, but we are finding opportunities to do things more efficiently. \n And I would say what we're doing today is kind of Phase 1, and that each market is looking at what they can do on their own. And then there is an opportunity that we're focused on to more globalize the business, and that's taking best practices from each market in terms of what their expertise is and taking that to other markets to see if we can drive additional efficiencies there. For example, in the U.S., we've automated a lot of our processes. And the question that we're asking ourselves is, can we take those automations and use them internationally to drive even more efficiency there?\n In Africa, we are extremely efficient with how we use fuel in our Power as a Service business. So we're looking at that and saying, can we export those practices to other markets like the U.S. And so right now, we're being very deliberate and kind of chasing the low-hanging fruit that's just inherent in the business after coming off a decade of growth. And then we're going to be very thoughtful about continuing to look at those costs as we try to become as efficient as we can everywhere we can over time. Sure. So when it comes to our international markets, we have a variety of contract structures, and sometimes, they depend on whether it's with an acquisition that we did or build-to-suits or a bigger part of the business there. So I would say there's a lot more variation in terms of how we construct our contracts internationally. We do have a couple of holistic type deals internationally. Again, a little bit different flavor than we would have in the U.S., but we do try to utilize those contract structures.\n Yes, I think that's something that may be an opportunity for us over time. But it takes time to get the customers to understand those. They're not typically used in a lot of those markets. And so kind of educating them on the benefits of those type structures and seeing the experience that our U.S. customers have had in terms of being able to continue to utilize those agreements and see value from them is something that may take some time.\n In terms of the U.S. agreements at the end of the year this year, there's nothing that we would point to you specifically on that, that we're talking about publicly at this point. So I would expect a ton of change there. Well, look, it's a little early for us to be giving any type of guidance for 2025. But look, we think that our fundamental growth algorithm kind of holds true. And so when we look at 2025, we continue to see strong fundamentals in our business. That includes a continuation of solid U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth, even while we're still absorbing some headwinds associated with that final tranche of spread churn that happens in Q4 of this year.\n We see leasing volumes in Africa and Europe remaining positive with churn remaining low in Europe and an expectation for further moderation in China and Africa. Continued strong growth from CoreSite, especially as we're commencing those kind of record levels of new business that we've signed since the transaction was consummated. And we'll complement that topline growth with, again, continuing to focus on margin expansion and cost discipline and continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation.\n Now that growth can be a little bit offset by the headwinds we have in Latin America because we do see an elevated consolidation churn environment there for the next few years, and that's going to keep Latin America kind of in that low single-digit growth. \n And then again, when you think about 2025 and beyond, there's a lot of variables that we're keeping our eyes on, like FX rates, interest rates, services, is inherently harder to predict. So we won't be trying to guide anything on that until early next year.\n And then the timing of the India closing will also have an impact on what that AFFO per share growth rate is, although we think we've been very clear about what that means to us. I think most of our investors understand the variability on that with the timing. But all those kind of variables, we think, point to our long-term growth algorithm remaining strong in 2025 and beyond."
