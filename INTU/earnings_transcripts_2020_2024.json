At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. I hope you are all safe and well. We had a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a dynamic fiscal year 2020. Full year revenue grew 13% and operating margin expanded. Total revenue growth was fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, and 13% growth in the Consumer Group. QBO and TTO platform revenue totaled $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2020, growing 22% year-over-year.  With our AI-driven expert platform strategy and the focus on our five Big Bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation in the current environment, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. Since we just finished tax season, let\u2019s start there. This tax season was like no other and our team delivered a strong season in an uncertain environment by executing on our strategy of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category, transforming the assisted category, and disrupting consumer finance. Based on our estimates, excluding stimulus filings of approximately $7 million to $8 million, the Do-It-Yourself category share grew over 2 points this season. We grew our share of total returns and posted 11% customer growth, the strongest in four years, while growing revenue double-digits for the third year in a row. We grew the base of customers paying us nothing just over 20%, posted double-digit growth of new customers across underpenetrated segments including Latinx, Self-Employed and customers with investments, and we grew TurboTax Live customers nearly 70%. Now turning to Small Business, revenue for the Small Business and Self-Employed group grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the year. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter, including 4 points of nonrecurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program and 31% for the year. We are seeing the resiliency of our platform following a different demand earlier this year when shelter-in-place shutdown many Small Businesses. We are now seeing recovering trends across our platforms, including improved retention rates, payment volumes and employees paid with our payroll offerings, as customers continue to rely on QuickBooks as the source of truth for their business. With that said, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in the market, particularly for Small Businesses as the pandemic continues to run its course. Next, I will turn to the progress of our AI-driven Expert Platform strategy and how we are executing against our five Big Bets. These Big Bets focus on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I will cover big bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other bets. Big bet number two is Connect People to Experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence to do their own taxes and to manage their business. We are connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, allowing us to reach more customers, deepen our engagement, and grow ARPC. Within TurboTax Live, we had a terrific season. The number of TurboTax Live customers grew nearly 70%. We provided new ways for customers to access an expert throughout the filing process, contributing to first-year retention and conversion rates increasing several points. And almost 70% of new TurboTax customers who used our Live offerings came from an assisted method the prior year, a higher percentage of TurboTax Online. For experts on our platform, we saw higher satisfaction scores and lower attrition as we focused on improving the expert experience. For QuickBooks Live, we are proud of the progress we have made this year building on the virtual expert platform we created for TurboTax Live. With the rapid adoption of virtual solutions, we continue to see encouraging early signs for QuickBooks Live as we further develop the offering with a higher percentage than expected of customers upgrading to a monthly subscription from our setup offering we introduced in January. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions by connecting customers with financial offerings that help put more money in their pockets. In its third season, we more than doubled monthly active use for Turbo and increased customer retention rates as we grew registered users by 8 million to 22 million. This suggests customers are finding value from our recently introduced innovations such as refund tracking and goal setting. We expect our pending acquisition of Credit Karma to be more important than ever in this challenging environment as we work to help consumers save money, get out of debt and have faster access to money. We continue to expect the transaction to close the second half of calendar year 2020. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of Small Business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence, and grow in an omnichannel world. We recently launched QuickBooks Cash, a Small Business bank account that provides full visibility into Small Businesses current and future financial picture with the ability to move money instantly and to ensure this money is working for them, while leveraging the built-in accounting capabilities of QuickBooks.  The cash account earns an attractive interest rate and enables Small Businesses to set aside funds for upcoming expenses and envelopes and comes with a debit card. It\u2019s fully integrated with QuickBooks Payment and Payroll, enabling a Small Business to pay a worker or vendor the same day they receive the funds from a customer. It also includes an integrated cash flow planner to predict future cash needs. We are very excited to learn fast and scale this new innovation. We continue to support our Small Business customers by helping them access the Paycheck Protection program or PPP in QuickBooks Capital. As of July 31ST, Intuit helped make available just over $1.2 billion of approved Small Business loans to customers. We have helped approximately 37,000 Small Businesses access the loans with an average loan of nearly $38,000, keeping over 220,000 employees on payrolls. Finally, following the announced acquisition of TradeGecko\u2019s robust inventory and order management system, we look forward to sharing more with you at Investor Day about how we will integrate these capabilities into QuickBooks to help Small Businesses manage and grow in an omnichannel environment. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the Small Business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, designed to address the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees. Throughout the last year, we introduced features to help customers individually tailor the offerings to their needs, including workflow automation, build your own dashboard, custom fields for expense transactions, and batch invoicing and payments. We also continue to work closely with partners to establish deeper integrations with premium apps with the goal to save our customer\u2019s time by personalizing the offering and improving their experience. Now more than ever, a simple flexible cloud offering is needed by mid-market customers at a disruptive price. Let me wrap up our Big Bets by circling back to Big Bet number one, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customer\u2019s pockets, eliminate friction, and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. Here are a couple of examples of the progress that we are making. First, we accelerated use of AI and increased the number of models deployed across our platform by over 50% this year. This increased use of AI drove a variety of customer benefits, including saving customers 25,000 hours with self-help and cutting expert review time in half, improving customer confidence.  Second, we completed the migration of our data centers to the cloud, while expanding our core technology capabilities. This enables us to decrease downtime by 30%, tripled the speed of delivery on our modern development platform and increased mobile applications deployments by 60%. We can now launch new features in a fraction of the time it once took to deliver customer benefits with even greater speed. As I shared earlier, we believe the current environment is acting as an accelerant for these bets. Most everyone is looking for virtual solutions, Small Businesses are accelerating their shift to online and omnichannel commerce, and both consumers and small businesses are looking for ways to put more money in their pocket. To wrap up, I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments this year. We remain focused on what matters most to our customers and what we can control during this time of uncertainty. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. We are successfully executing on the principles we laid out last quarter for operating in a downturn. These principles are designed to accelerate our execution and help both our customers and Intuit emerge from the downturn stronger than ever. Let me now turn to our results. As a reminder, fourth quarter reflects -- fourth quarter results reflect a shift of a significant portion of tax filings out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.8 billion, GAAP operating income of $483 million versus a loss of $153 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $616 million versus a loss of $47 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.68 versus a loss per share of $0.17 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.81 versus a loss per share of $0.09 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 13% in fiscal 2020, TurboTax units grew 11% and our retention rate increased again this year for our online tax customers. There are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. Based on the latest IRS data through July 24th, we estimate total returns including paper filings grew 3% to 4%. This excludes approximately $7 million to $8 million stimulus-only filings. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using Do-It-Yourself software. Excluding stimulus-only filings, we estimate category share grew over 2 points this season, the fastest pace in 15 years. As a reminder, the DIY category growth is our largest revenue growth lever. The third driver is our share within DIY, excluding stimulus-only filings, we estimate our share of total tax returns grew over 1.5 points and our share of the category was flat. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. The growth reflects the stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and minor price increases in the premier product and state attached. Turning to the Strategic Partner Group, we reported $493 million of professional tax revenue in fiscal 2020, up 4%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed group, revenue grew 16% during the quarter and 15% in fiscal 2020, including nonrecurring PPP revenue. Excluding PPP, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 13% during the quarter and 14% in fiscal 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on small businesses. Online Ecosystem revenue remained resilient, with growth of 29% during the quarter and 31% during the year, including nonrecurring PPP revenue. Excluding PPP, Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% in fiscal Q4 and 30% in fiscal 2020. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Last quarter, I shared recent business trends and I\u2019d like to update you on those same trends compared to pre-COVID levels in the first half of the third quarter. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and to a lesser extent mix shift. During the fourth quarter, QBO new customer acquisition accelerated by approximately 10 points versus the second half of the third quarter, but it\u2019s still down 5 points from pre-COVID levels. Retention within the existing customer base improved during Q4, but full year QBO retention is down two points to 77%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue grew 21% in fiscal Q4 driven by payments, PPP loans, payroll and Time Tracking. Excluding non-recurring PPP revenue, Online Services revenue grew 12%. Within Payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offerings. The number of workers paid was roughly flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter, improving from a 10% year-over-year decrease during the second half of the third quarter, but still 20 points below pre-COVID levels. Similarly, the number of companies running Payroll grew approximately 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, improving from flat year-over-year in the second half of the third quarter. This is still 5 points below pre-COVID levels. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Payment charge volume grew 15% in the fourth quarter, improving from flat year-over-year in the second half of the third quarter. This is still 15 points below pre-COVID levels. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4. Total international online revenue grew 31%, reflecting subscriber and ARPC growth earlier in the fiscal year. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 3% in the fourth quarter and roughly flat for the year. Excluding nonrecurring PPP revenue, Desktop Ecosystem revenue was flat in the fourth quarter. The decline in Desktop units moderated in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Intuit helped facilitate more than $1.2 billion in Small Business loans from the Paycheck Protection Program through QuickBooks Capital. This resulted in approximately $30 million in non-recurring revenue in the fourth quarter. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, though we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment. During the fourth quarter, we refocused our investments to ensure our capabilities are aligned against our AI-driven expert platform strategy and Big Bets. This resulted in the departure of over 700 employees and a one-time charge of $43 million in both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We plan to hire about 700 employees in our most strategic areas including systems, full staff and beta engineering, data science, customer success and sales. Turning back to our financial principles, our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $7.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. In June, we issued $2 billion in senior notes to fund a portion of the Credit Karma acquisition and for other general corporate purposes. These notes carry a blended coupon rate of 1.15%. Following the end of the quarter, we repaid the $1 billion balance on our revolver. We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter, as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market in the future. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable October 19, 2020. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, while we are not providing company level guidance today reflecting uncertainty in Small Business trends, we believe the current environment accelerated our consumer results this season, creating a more challenging comparison for next year. We see several scenarios for how the economic recovery may impact our Small Business performance and that we are considering as we run the business. The first scenario is that the pace of economic recovery continues at its current pace, reaching normalized growth in the spring of 2021. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew high-single digits. The second scenario is a more gradual opening of the economy, including ongoing headwinds from Small Business failures. This W-shaped recovery assumes cases increase during the winter months coinciding with our peak season in the U.S. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grow mid-single digits. The third scenario is a choppy recovery and more than one wave of Small Business failures or shutdowns, creating a double W-shaped recovery. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue flat-to-up low-single digits. In addition, we expect a slower Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth in the first half, as compared to the second half of fiscal 2021. We supported customers during the second half of 2020 by delaying price increases, migration to our new payroll offerings and upgrades to QBO Advanced. As a reminder, we began rolling out a QBO price increase in first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will start lapping the full impact of that increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Keep in mind that there is also a lagging impact to QuickBooks Online accounting revenue from the slower customer acquisition and higher attrition we experienced during third quarter. To reiterate, our long-term expectations include revenue growth of 8% to 12% for the Consumer Group and 10% to 15% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. We continue to expect Online Ecosystem revenue growth of more than 30% longer term. Lastly, we expect a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2021. And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks, Michelle. I am very proud of the team and all that we have accomplished together in fiscal year 2020. We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact on the world, as our mission has never been more meaningful than now to power prosperity around the world. I look forward to sharing with you how our strategy of an AI-driven expert platform and our five Big Bets are accelerating innovation at our virtual Investor Day on September 23rd. Let\u2019s now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much, and congrats on a really strong finish to the year. Sasan, I wanted to get your take on some recent forecasts that have been made by the IRS, that there would be about 37 million fewer W-2 employee-classified jobs in 2021, with this lower level of employment persisting through 2027 and they also see fewer filings of 1099 forms and about 1.6 million more gig workers. So number one, how important or accurate do you think these forecasts are? And two, does this reality or environment impact how you will be thinking about the medium-term growth algorithm of the tax business especially as it relates to overall filings?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Thanks, Brad. I hope all is well with you my friend.\nBrad Zelnick: Likewise.\nSasan Goodarzi: So let me -- I am aware of the stats, maybe if I can just touch on history and touch on how we think about the future. If I take us back to the recession in 2008 and the way that played out in \u201808 and \u201809, what we saw in filings was they were kind of flat to down just a little bit. And so even in very tough times, you saw a general flat environment when it came to number of filings. Now, these times are a bit different than \u201808 and \u201809, but history is always important to look at. When we look ahead, a couple of things, one is unemployment was very low at the beginning of this fiscal year and unemployment also gets taxed. And so when we think about 2021 and beyond, there may be -- the filings maybe down a bit, or they may be close to flat. It does not at all change our strategic focus. And just as a refresher we are really focused on expanding our Do-It-Yourself category. There\u2019s still a massive opportunity that I believe we are just getting started and transforming the assisted category. And so when you look at our penetration and the assisted category when you look at the opportunity we still have in expanding the Do-It-Yourself category, we believe that the long-term expectations of what we have set around 8% to 12% Consumer Group revenue growth still stands. So that\u2019s how we think about the couple of years that are upcoming given the number of folks that are unemployed.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much for that, Sasan. And Michelle, if I can just follow up with you on your comments about a difficult compare in tax into this year, specifically if we think about a very strong penetration and growth in TTL. Is it fair to say that investors should expect slowing of the penetration rate just because, I mean, this year seems to have been clearly a perfect storm if anybody were to enter the category and especially to try TTL, how are you thinking about that? Thank you.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Brad. I hope you are doing well too. I would say a couple of things, what Sasan just said applies to your question. Our strategic focus is not changing. We continue to focus on expanding our lead in DIY and also transforming assisted with the TurboTax Live product. There may have been some -- a little bit more of a challenge this year, more people filing from home. But we think that there\u2019s just a large opportunity for us to continue to focus on our strategy of bringing folks into the category and bringing folks into TurboTax Live. We are really proud of the progress we have made this year with the 70% increase in customers and we do believe that we will continue to build on the tailwinds from this year.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: One thing I will add, oh, sorry, Brad.\nBrad Zelnick: Yes.\nSasan Goodarzi: Just one thing I would add that\u2019s complementary to what Michelle just shared. The facts are always friendly, right? And when you think about those 86 million folks in the assisted category, it\u2019s a $20 billion TAM and this is now heading into our sort of fourth year in transforming the category. We have not really even hit the inflection point of what\u2019s possible, so just it\u2019s an important reminder that we are in the early days of transforming the assisted category.\nBrad Zelnick: Perfect. Thank you again so much, and congrats again, and hope everybody stays well.\nSasan Goodarzi: Okay. Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question. First -- the first question is for you, Sasan. In the past, you have mentioned, e-commerce as being a top priority, you guys made the acquisition of TradeGecko earlier. Just wondering kind of where we are in terms of that particular strategy, anything else that needed to be tacked on here? Just would love to get some color on kind of how you are envisioning that part of your business, especially with the shift to e-commerce so evident this year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Ken, I hope you are doing well. In terms of the question around e-commerce, I think, the place I would start is one of the companies\u2019 five Big Bets is about being the center of Small Business growth with a particular focus on transforming omnichannel commerce. And the biggest thing that we have found in all homes and the tests that we have run this past year is for our customers is actually quite easy to launch on new channels, whether it\u2019s Etsy, whether it\u2019s Instagram, whether it\u2019s Facebook, Amazon. The biggest challenge they have is they actually choke their growth, because they really lose sight of which customers are coming from which channels, the profitability, the connection to their inventory and ultimately fulfillment. So the worst thing for a Small Business, particularly the ones that we serve is not being able to fulfill an order. So really our focus is to truly be an agnostic open platform to partner with the channels that are out there, again, the ones that I mentioned, also partner with those that provide websites and also the PLS providers, while really focusing on the core of what matters most to our customers and our core competency, which is around helping customers -- our customers with understanding the profitability by channel, connecting them to inventory. And so our acquisition of TradeGecko is, I think, a huge first step and we will share what we are launching at Investor Day, that really focuses on inventory order management and allows our customers to really take control of the thing that right now they don\u2019t have control of to give them the confidence to then open up across other channels. And so we will not only share what we are launching at Investor Day, but we will also reiterate the vision and where we are headed, what you can expect from us in the years to come. But this is a really important first step given all the work that we have done in the last year to be positioned to go after the, I would say, the highest order problem that our customers face.\nKen Wong: Okay. Perfect. And then, Michelle, a quick question for you. You gave us a rough sense of what the PPP impact was on revenue, just wonder if you can maybe give us a sense of how that might have impacted margins and earnings just so we make sure that we don\u2019t kind of rattle through profitability that might be more one-time-ish?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Ken. Yes. We are really proud of the work that the team did utilizing our platform and our modern technology to be able to turn so quickly to provide $1.2 billion in access to PPP loans for our Small Business customers in such a rough environment.  As for margins, I would say, we really do manage our margins at the company level and that\u2019s really how we think about this $30 million of revenue. Also, I would tell you that, given the environment, the tightening of credit that we had done, this was really more of a trade-off for the QuickBooks Capital team and really putting the majority of their focus on PPP versus extending credit through QuickBooks Capital.\nKen Wong: Got it. Appreciate that. Thank you, Michelle. \nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of RBC. Your line is open.\nRobert Simmons: Hi. This is Robert Simmons on for Alex. You kind of suggested this, but with the acquisition, can you talk about what else you need to do to deliver on your omnichannel plans?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Robert. Sure. I think, the way you ought to think about it is when you put yourself in the shoes of the Small Business. There\u2019s a few things that they need to be able to do. They depending on their products, may want to get set up on what we call mega channels. Again, it could be the walmart.com, Etsy, Amazon, Instagram. They may want to be able to also have their own store set up. They may want to ensure that they have a PLS provider to be able to transact with customers in a physical world. So then they also need to be able to manage all of their financials. They need to understand the profitability of their customers. It\u2019s got to be connected to inventory, so inventory can automatically remind them that they are about to run out of inventory and to order more and to be able to fulfill their orders on time and so shipments and delivery on time. And also ensuring that their accounting is done right, that they are compliant and if they need access to money and loans, that they have that ability, and in that context of making sure, when you think about our platform, we have really been positioned over the years to deliver for service based businesses and this is an area where we believe we have a right to win to deliver product for product based businesses when it comes to financial compliance. So right now our initial focus is really just nailing order management and inventory management. It\u2019s actually critical to ensuring that our customers have the confidence they can fulfill orders and actually understand their profitability, while we then establish partnerships beyond that with some of the channels that, I mentioned, the PLS providers and even some of the website builders. We truly want to be an open agnostic platform to focus on the problems that matter most and we believe an open platform is necessary to be able to ensure that customers have choice in how they choose to run their business. So initial focus is inventory and order management and this is really about rapid testing, experimentation and scaling what works well, and that\u2019s the way we are thinking about it.\nRobert Simmons: Got it. Great. Thanks. That makes sense. And then you also talked about what you have seen in terms of retention so far this fiscal year. I realize it\u2019s only been not quite four weeks, but have you seen it stabilize or has it improved and what you are expecting going forward?\nSasan Goodarzi: We have as you heard Michelle talk to, we have experienced really all of our key trends improve and retention specific to your question has improved from what we talked about last quarter. We do expect that it will be down approximately 2 points for the year, but we have seen an improvement over the last quarter. And I think more broadly, I would say, that being the source of truth for our customer\u2019s business has always been the case, but I think this pandemic has actually even made us more relevant because the shift to online whether it\u2019s payments, payroll, accounting, compliance, it\u2019s just become even more critical than it was four months or five months ago and so that over time may actually even impact retention more so. But we expect to be down 2 points for the year, and again, the trends have improved.\nRobert Simmons: Got it. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just want to ask you, Sasan, on your Big Bet number two about connecting experts through a live platform. First on the TurboTax Live, I think, the question would be retaining those live customers, although, it\u2019s too hard to say at this point, but could you share what kind of Net Promoter Score or any kind of feedback that your experts took from those new customers? That would be helpful.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Good to hear from you, Siti, and thank you for your kind words. We are really proud of the progress in TurboTax Live. Just as a reminder, one of the biggest things that we learned last year was we needed to really improve the first-time experience and the first user experience for our customers. We need to make sure that they had really access to an expert throughout the offering and actually reminding them that they have an access to an expert along the way. And on the other side, making the experience just really drop-dead easy for our experts, making sure that at the fingertips of our experts is insight for our customers from the moment they engage them, whether it\u2019s through chat or through video that they can resolve their issue. This is really -- this is a digital platform and it\u2019s a service offering. So the experts play such a critical role in the experience. And I would tell you that across the Board, the metrics that we look at are retention, conversion. It\u2019s PRS, product recommendation score for both the customer that is using the platform and also the experts. The happier the expert is, the more they feel they can solve the customer\u2019s problem, the higher in essence the recommendation score they give. And then we also look at efficiency, are they effectively able to solve the customers\u2019 problem? And across the Board, across every metric, it\u2019s been up and to the right, and so we have a lot of confidence. We are better this year than we were last year and I have every bit of confidence that we will be better a year from now. But across all of those key metrics, we significantly improved and so I would just expect our momentum and the kind of focus that our employees have on our customers to deliver better experiences, both our customers and our experts. So that\u2019s a little bit of a snapshot as to the progress that we have made up and to the right on all of the key metrics.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for that color. And a quick follow-up on the QBO side, it\u2019s actually surprising to see that 10-point acceleration of new customer acquisitions. So this is your full quarter of this pandemic impact. I am wondering what\u2019s driving that new customer growth although it\u2019s still below pre-COVID levels, but it is more people realize the complexity of PPP or any other driver, that would be helpful?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. One of the things that we have seen and we are fortunate that our Big Bets are the core of the shift, which is we are seeing more and more folks shift to a virtual world. We are seeing more and more folks want to shift to online solutions and omnichannel solutions. And then third is money matters more than ever, whether you are a Consumer, Self-Employed or Small Business. And I think the thing that we are experiencing although to your point that we are not at pre-COVID level yet -- levels yet, many customers are seeing that using our cloud offering gives them the ability to be able to engage with customers in the cloud and to help them avoid interaction in the physical world, higher usage of payments and payroll potentially over time, and frankly being compliant, a lot of customers realize that they weren\u2019t compliant and it was hard for them to get access to loans. So I think this environment has just -- we are seeing that shift to the cloud, and I think, that\u2019s why we have seen an acceleration in our acquisition compared to where we were just a quarter ago, although still below the pre-COVID levels.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you so much, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome. Be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. Sasan, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit on the Small Business side. Just how sensitive are customers to pricing changes right now given the economic backdrop and I guess how does that influence your strategy around maybe some of your higher value products like QBO Live and QBO Advanced as you go into fiscal 2021. Just trying to get a sense on does the macro dynamic have an influence on your strategy around that? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Kirk, good to hear from you and I hope you are safe and well. Particularly in the area that you asked the question, we are actually the low-cost alternative both with QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced. When you look at QuickBooks Advanced, first of all, this is one of the teams that just is innovating at a very rapid pace to ensure that our mid-market customers have all the capabilities that they need to be able to run their business, whether it\u2019s something we have built or other apps that our partners build on our platform, but in a very disruptive price. So I would say in some ways, QuickBooks Advanced becomes even more attractive than otherwise in this current environment because we are the low cost provider. And I would say the same thing for QuickBooks Live. These are folks that ultimately come to us that have been using bookkeepers and accountants and they are very dialed into what they have been paying and they really come to us because of the experience that they have had potentially with their bookkeepers and accountants, whereas we have a set of standards around what we expect in terms of the experience that our bookkeepers need to deliver for our customers. And so in that case, we also tend to be the low-cost provider and so we have become even more attractive in an environment like this. So that\u2019s the way we think about pricing. We believe that in these two areas, we are actually probably more attractive choice than others.\nKirk Materne: Okay. And then just the second question from me would be just in the SMB sort of area of your business any major changes in what you are seeing in terms of either customer acquisition or retention rate when you think about the U.S. versus some of your smaller regions, the U.K., international regions, I was just wondering if you have seen any real differences from a geographic perspective? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Absolutely. From a geographic perspective, I would say, the U.S. is probably holding up the strongest, probably next followed by Canada and then the U.K. But I would say, U.S. is held up the strongest and I think a lot of it just has to do with the nature of how the health crisis is being managed and how open the economy is, because all these Small Businesses have one commonality across the world. They are passionate about what they do and it\u2019s the way they earn their living, but with that said, U.S. has been the strongest. And of course, from the trends perspective, as you heard from Michelle, we have seen across the Board our trends improve and now stabilize. They are not at pre-COVID levels. But I would say solid improvement just in the last three months as the economy has opened up a bit.\nKirk Materne: Thank you. Stay well.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you. Very welcome. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Hey. Good afternoon, Sasan. Just following up on Kirk\u2019s comments on SMB, I guess, you have seen such a surge in the front office with CRM, wicks, number of the companies doing extremely well and I think part of the logic many investors are following is that inevitably companies have to turn back to the back office at the end of the day and if you are driving all this online traffic, you have got to drive the back office as well and more around kind of the shape of the recovery and do you believe that you can benefit from the surge you are seeing in the front office that is an indication that it\u2019s good signs for your SMB business going forward? And maybe if you could just highlight where you think the biggest opportunities are? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sure, Brent. Good to hear from you, and again, I hope you are safe and well. First of all, I would start with the point you made which is exactly right. At the end of the day, getting a store set up to be able to do business, you have to be able to accept payments, you have to -- you want to hire contractors or full-time employees, you have to use payroll, especially if you are a younger smaller business, you need access to loans and so then you need to make sure that you are compliant. And so that\u2019s where all of our services come in and why they -- why even in this environment as we look ahead, our services become even more critical to ensure a customer can be organized, get paid and run their business profitability. So with that as context, I think, the second context I would just bring up is, it is remarkable how resilient our platform and business model is. You saw what happened last quarter when we talked about some of the trends and how the trends had kind of fallen off given that we shutdown the economy in the U.S. and how they have bounced back. Again, all still not to pre-COVID levels but they have bounced back. And so really to, I think, the second part of your question, the way we are thinking about the future is in context of what you heard from Michelle. If the economy continues on the track that it\u2019s on and gets to normalized levels in spring of 2021, as long as Small Businesses are able to do business, I think, our platform is going to benefit. So a lot of our performance because the platform is resilient, the business model is resilient, it\u2019s more than ever it\u2019s times like this when customers need our platform. I think a lot of it will just depend on how the economy opens up because we are in the cloud, we have capabilities in the cloud, and our customers need our capabilities plus we are an agnostic platform. We believe the way you deliver for customers is to have partnerships with all these key players and I just think that that advantages our network, but that\u2019s the way we think about it.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMark Rende: Hi. This is Mark Rende on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to ask, you discussed the TurboTax share within the DIY category was flat year-over-year compared to I think prior years the TurboTax gained share. So what are you seeing in the competitive environment and just like the competitive intensity in the DIY online filing market?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very good question. And it\u2019s actually we think about the category very differently now than we did four to five years ago and for us it\u2019s about the entire category of filers and not just about the Do-It-Yourself category. So just if I could refresh us on the fact that the do-it-yourself category is about $6 billion TAM, the assisted category is about $20 billion in TAM, and of course, what we declared in consumer finance is north of $55 million in the TAM. And so for us, what is most important is the share that we have in the entire category and so we are very, very pleased with the fact that our share of the entire category is up 1.5 points and that is really how we measure success, and that is really our goal line, because when you think about the dollar share of the Do-It-Yourself category, we have the majority of the share, we are focused on the assisted category, whether it\u2019s $20 billion of opportunity for us.\nMark Rende: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then maybe one quick one, just in terms of it\u2019s been asked a couple times, but to ask it slightly differently, have you seen a change in kind of the profile of new QuickBooks subscribers maybe post-COVID versus pre-COVID, like, for instance, has there been uptick in kind of acquisitions with QuickBooks Self-Employed, and kind of if so, what impact did that have an ARPC moving forward? Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome. So a couple of things I would say, one is, it is inspirational and remarkable how resilient Small Businesses are and how they are looking to adjust how they can still serve their customers. And I would just say, that\u2019s an uber point where if one door shuts for them, they open up another door to figure out if there is a different way to serve their customers. So that\u2019s really important to recognize and as long as they can manage their task load, they are going to find other ways to be able to serve their customers, which really gets to the second point and that is I think there -- it\u2019s become very apparent, one, how meaningful and relevant we are in this environment to help our customers operate in the cloud. There was an element of well, I can just manage through multiple different, use paper and pen and my bookkeeper to run my business. I think people are now seeing, hey, what, I can be far more effective invoicing and getting paid instantly, being able to do payroll and ensure that I am accurate in my payroll, so I am not paying penalties or ensuring that I am organized, so I understand my task force, especially with a lot of launches that we talked about with our QuickBooks cash and cash flow planner to be effective. So I think what you are seeing is I have an opportunity to much more effective and efficient with my cash flow using Intuit\u2019s platform and the cloud, and the resiliency of our Small Businesses just finding new and unique ways to do business, while we are I think experiencing the bounce back relative to the last quarter. Again, reminding us though that they are still not at the pre-COVID levels.\nMark Rende: Got it. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Yeah. It was a really strong quarter in Consumer. I am curious kind of the high level question is how should we think about margin in that segment going forward? I see it was down about 100 bps year-over-year for the full year and I am guessing if you can elaborate you got some nice leverage in TurboTax Live staffing, getting more efficient there, and clearly, you have got good volume growth in revenue per return growth. But I know you spent a little higher marketing in the fiscal fourth quarter just due to the change in the year and then a lot more free file alliance clients this year, you addressed the percentage of folks that you serve free. So just if you can address how we would think about that going longer term and maybe some puts and takes in the quarter? Thanks -- or in the year, rather?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Yeah. Sure, Scott. Good to hear from you. Hope you are well. I would focus on the fact that we truly manage investments and margins at the company level. What really matters most is that we delivered 13% revenue and 17% operating income both GAAP and non-GAAP and EPS grew 16%. And so our leverage is more and more at the company level, because we are truly more and more building services across our platform at the company level. And so margin levels moving up or down a point, I wouldn\u2019t get overly excited about it at the segment level, because of the fact that we are making our investment choices the way we are running the company is more and more at a platform across the company. So I would really look at company level performance and not just segment level performance because of how we are making our investment choices and we are getting a lot of leverage because of the way we are doing it.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. And on a follow-up, it\u2019s kind of a two-part here and I am not sure how much you are going to address. But your main tax competitor mentioned that they probably leave or almost definitively would leave the free file alliance going forward, I am just curious your take on that program and obviously you addressed the free customers you served this year. And then also with Credit Karma, there are tax customers in that, just any comments about that and the deal that you could comment on? Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Absolutely. So let me just first share with you the objectives that we have that we shared in previous years when it comes to taxes. One is, we are a big believer in voluntary tax. Two, we are a big believer that those that are deserving whether it\u2019s income levels and military and we want to make sure that they can get their taxes done for free and in some cases philosophy. And last but not least is, we always want to enhance our reputation, so that\u2019s kind of one bucket of objectives to think about. The second is our strategy and it\u2019s very much intertwined. When we talk about the notion of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category transforming the assisted category and disrupting consumer finance, the core part of our strategy is actually for those that deserve it to give them the ability to do their taxes for free because over time they can not only grow with us but also we can solve other problems beyond tax. So that\u2019s the way we think about our strategy, that\u2019s the way we think about our innovation and we are very dedicated to helping those that deserve it most to get their taxes done for free. So that\u2019s -- those are the things that ultimately inform how we think about SLK.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wonder if you could remind us what portion of the QuickBooks users also are using Payroll at this point? In other words, what visibility do you have in terms of the potential of impending business closures and when that kind of headwind might peak and start to subside for you?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sterling, thank you for the question. First of all, we don\u2019t break out what the percentage of our base is that uses Payroll. But what I would share is some of the stats and take you back to some of the stats that Michelle shared, which is, we have actually seen a nice bounce back of companies in essence running Payroll. It\u2019s still below pre-COVID levels, but we have seen a nice bounce back. And they have less employees but the number of companies running payroll has bounced back nicely. I think that\u2019s one indication that we look at. I think the broader indication that we look at is really cash flow and when we look at across our base, remember, 70% of our base of service-based businesses, whether it\u2019s real estate, landscaping, bookkeeping, computer and software. We look across who we serve and we also look by state, which is very different. We are seeing a nice bounce back in places like North Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey and Arizona, but on the other hand states that are recovering slower New York, California, Michigan, just to give a couple of examples. And when we look across industries and across those states, this is based on our own analysis of those that have connected to QuickBooks their bank accounts. We see their bank averages could range from being down 10% to up towards 20%. So what we really monitor is cash flow, because that is ultimately the biggest indication as to whether or not are they going to be able to make it through these times and that is really what we are -- what informs some of the indicators that you heard Michelle talk to. And last but not least, we expect our retention to be down about 2 points this year given some of what we experienced with our customers being shut down.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your question, please.\nJennifer Lowe: Thank you. I just wanted to touch quickly on TurboTax Live and you gave a stat earlier about the very strong adoption you saw in TurboTax Live within customers that had converted off of Pro this tax season. This season was obviously a very unusual one all around. But I am curious if that uptake or that experience if you find some of the weighting between increased retention of existing customers and not having them go to Pro versus pulling customers away from Pro. Does that give you any conviction that maybe it\u2019s -- there\u2019s more opportunity to put a marketing push behind getting customers away from Pro and on to TurboTax Live than maybe you would have thought before the season?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Jen, thank you for your question and hope you are well and safe. We have never lacked conviction around TurboTax Live. We believe that we are just at the beginning of really creating a platform that goes viral, because the more people that do their taxes digitally with help coming to them in any frame that they need it, whether it\u2019s in their home or in their office, the more they are going to tell others and the more this will go viral. And I think, as I have shared before, based on the research and work that we have done, out of the 86 million folks that use an assisted method, about 70 million or so are willing to switch. So our focus has been experimenting, learning, looking at our results both in terms of how we raise awareness, how we bring folks into consideration and then the experience that we deliver on the platform. And I would just tell you that a year later we are a lot better than we were this time last year, particularly this extended tax season, albeit we all wished it would have ended in April given the tax put on our employees. We were able to actually experiment for another three months. So we ran a lot of tests on our platform and both in terms of how to raise awareness but also how to really nail the experience when customers come in. And as I mentioned earlier, all of our metrics, conversion, retention, PRS for both customers and our experts were all up and to the right. So based on what we learned this year, not just the results, but more importantly the learning, that actually gives us a lot more conviction of what we need to do for this coming tax season and even beyond. And so we feel blessed with the insights of learnings and we will absolutely be leaning in. But not just because of our results. We have had a lot of conviction, but just because of our learnings it allows us to be clear in terms of where we point our innovation.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Millman: Thank you. So do you believe that assuming businesses have a tough time going forward if the virus continues that many of those unemployed will turn to being Self-Employed and in fact that your numbers will actually increase? And also on the tax, do you believe that people who have done their taxes at home this year are unlikely to switch back if indeed they are physically able to switch back?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Michael, thank you for your question and I also hope you are safe and well. Let me hit on two things. I mean, I think, one, what I would say based on history. We know that we are a globe of entrepreneurs. And sometimes it\u2019s out of passion for an idea that you have and sometimes it\u2019s because you need to figure out a way to create income. And so at the end of the day, we don\u2019t build our business on hoping that there will be a lot of SMB new starts, but certainly in an environment like this could be a trigger for new Self-Employed and Small Businesses, and we certainly, want to be there for them the moment they have an idea and a passion to pursue something. And as you heard from Michelle earlier, just a lot of it depends on just how we see the health crisis play out and therefore the impact on the economy. On the tax side on your question about the experience that folks may have gotten whether or not they would be unlikely to switch back to their old method. The thing that we have learned over the years, this isn\u2019t the first year that we have gotten a lot of our customers from the assisted segment. It all comes down to the experience. And the confidence that they have in doing their taxes right, the confidence that they have in getting their maximum refund and we feel good about the experience that we delivered this year for customers based on our product recommendation scores. And so we also learned a lot in terms of what we need to do to continue to improve our platform. So we would hope that our retention rates play out next year the way they have in previous years, but it\u2019s primarily because of the type of experience that we deliver and of course this time next year will be far better in terms of the experiences that we will deliver, that we are even now given our rapid testing and learning mindset. So that\u2019s the way I would think about your two questions.\nMichael Millman: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah.\nMichael Millman: Be safe.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome. Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. We have touched on margin a few times, but we were impressed you were actually able to expand margin this year given the extended tax filing season even with the PPP offset, was that within your own internal expectations given the spillover on the tax side and is there any additional color you can add around whether that improvement could prove more durable as you continue to drive towards delivering higher value on both segments? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Michael, thank you for your question. First of all, I would start with the principles that Michelle talked about earlier and I will just touch on a few of them as a starting point to answer your question, because it is how we run the company. And ultimately our principles are we want to grow revenue double-digits. We want to grow operating income faster than revenue. We want to make sure that we get 15% return on our investments and ensure that we solve our customer\u2019s most important problems. In that context and you have heard Michelle and I talk about it in the last year that we are really just continuing to be at the beginning of our platform journey. And that journey really means that we are going to continue to get better at building services one so that they can be used across the company. You heard some of our metrics around 50% increase in the number of AI models we have deployed this year, our velocity being up 3X compared to last year. That\u2019s all innovation. But that\u2019s also efficiency and effectiveness. And although, we don\u2019t set out a specific goal of increasing operating margins, because we want to make sure that we can simply deliver against the principle of operating income growing faster than revenue, I think, the result of becoming more effective and efficient could suggest that over time our operating margins will expand. And as you said yourself, we did actually spend more money in tax this year because of the extended season. It was both in marketing and customer success because we wanted to be there for our customers, because in essence we had two tax seasons in one. So we actually did spend more money. And as you saw, we expanded our operating margins because I think we are starting to see the leverage of our platform and that was not by accident.\nMichael Turrin: That\u2019s great. Thanks. Nice close to the year.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJosh Beck: Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Cash. It seems like an interesting extension of your services and really gets you a little bit more into banking and debit card. So it\u2019s probably a little too early, I am guessing to talk about the adoption curves. But would love to hear just kind of your ambitions for this product and where it could go over a multi-year period?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for your question, Josh, and hope you are safe and well. First of all, you said it, we are very, very early. We have been working on this for some time, but we are very early, but we are very excited and I wouldn\u2019t think about QuickBooks Cash as a service. I would think about it as a very disruptive way for achieving this notion of truly being the source of truth for a customer\u2019s business. And just think about it in terms of a place where you can receive and send money. So when you do work for a customer and you invoice them, it automatically gets dumped into your QuickBooks Cash account where you can in essence have interest that you gain on your money, a place that you can just pay your employees right out of your QuickBooks Cash account, a place where you can buy inventory from your QuickBooks Cash account, a place where you can get access to capital from your QuickBooks Cash account. And while you are doing all that, because it\u2019s all happening in your QuickBooks Cash account, the accounting is actually getting done for you and so you don\u2019t actually have to do a bunch of reconciliation. That\u2019s really what we are focused on really creating in terms of a benefit for our customers and something that customers won\u2019t tell you that they need this, but when you really listen to what gets in their way, it\u2019s just can I have something that everything gets done for me and that\u2019s really the intent of QuickBooks Cash. We are just excited with the launch. We are excited to learn, to adjust, to test and to scale this very fast and it\u2019s something that we are going to talk about our virtual gallery walk at Investor Day in September. So hopefully that entices you to show up. It should be fun.\nJosh Beck: Yeah. That\u2019s a great pitch there for the day, so excited about that. And just quickly on Live, the 70% growth, nearly 70% in customers, seems like a really good result. So I am just curious was that ahead of plan and anything that stood out to there, and maybe how we could think about the retention of Live customers from a prior season versus the kind of net new that you get this season?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. I would tell you that as tradition would hold for Intuit, we always set very, very ambitious goals for ourselves for the near-term and for the long-term, because it really just forces us to take bigger swings for our customers. So I won\u2019t get into how we did versus our internals. But what I would tell you is that we feel truly terrific about the results, because literally on every dimension that you look at it, new customers growing 70%, 70% coming from the assisted segment, conversion being up year-over-year, retention being up year-over-year, PRX being up for our customers, PRX being up for our experts, our experts actually being very efficient delivering the 60 million hours that they engaged with our customers. We are really happy with the end result because it was truly an end to end experience that the team delivered. And we learned a ton, we learned what was not working. We learned how to be more effective. We learned how to deploy our AI models even more effectively, so that we can have the insights at the fingertips of our experts so they can deliver for customers. This is truly a digital service experience and so we are excited for next year and the next five years to come.\nJosh Beck: Really helpful, Sasan. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Hi, Sasan. Interested in your thoughts on QBO, I think, you and Michelle talked about price increases and obviously they are going to be a little bit more difficult in the upcoming fiscal year and I am wondering at what point do you feel comfortable increasing prices on QBO SKUs?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Kartik, good to hear your voice and hope you are also keeping well my friend. So I think the uber point, I would say, is we are just obsessively focused on our customers. When you think about what our teams did in the last 12 weeks with PPP, with the GoFundMe platform that funded $37 million, with our Instant Deposit being free through July. Just to name a few, extending the deferred payment of our QuickBooks Capital customers, those that were really struggling and needed the help. We will make the right choice for our customers, and ultimately, we want to make sure that the value equation makes sense based on the rapid progress of our innovation and the fact that our speed of innovation is up 3x versus last year. So we always want to make sure that the value equation makes sense. But we are just going to see how the health crisis plays out and how the economy plays out and make our pricing decisions based on the principles that we have at the right time and this isn\u2019t the time to share when that is, because we really want to see how things play out. But that\u2019s principally the way we think about it.\nKartik Mehta: And then just as a follow-up, Sasan, in the past, you have always had capability to QBO making the product better and better. If the economy doesn\u2019t allow for a price increase, would you continue to add capabilities and try to capture the value at some later point?\nSasan Goodarzi: Absolutely. And in fact, I would tell you that we play the long game here when it comes to our R&D investments, and as I mentioned earlier, I think, we are just picking up momentum truly operating as a platform company and the innovation that we delivered this year was just -- got accelerated from just even a year ago. And by the way, that\u2019s been the trend we have been on for the company for the last 37 years and so we are actually -- we use opportunities like this to accelerate innovation and become much more effective, because we know one day we are going to get the value for it, for our customers and for shareholders. So the short answer or the long answer, I should say is, absolutely yes.\nKartik Mehta: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You are very welcome. Stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. And just following up on the last line of questioning, Sasan, from a high level, as you add more product to the QuickBooks platform. How do you decide what should be bundled and what should be charged for?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hi, Brad. Hope you are well and safe. Ultimately, it\u2019s the test that we run. It is very similar to what we do in TurboTax and across the Live platform. At the end of the day, it comes down to understanding the benefit that you are delivering and whether or not a customer is willing to pay for it. But we also think about it relative to the impact on retention in the long-term. And so based on those in essence levers that inform the things that we test inclusive of even tests to come where we may choose to have accounting being free but then charge for services. So it really comes down to the experiments that we run and we let the data help inform strategically the choices that we make and that\u2019s primarily the way we have operated for years across the company.\nBrad Reback: Great.

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. We are successfully executing on the principles we laid out last quarter for operating in a downturn. These principles are designed to accelerate our execution and help both our customers and Intuit emerge from the downturn stronger than ever. Let me now turn to our results. As a reminder, fourth quarter reflects -- fourth quarter results reflect a shift of a significant portion of tax filings out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.8 billion, GAAP operating income of $483 million versus a loss of $153 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $616 million versus a loss of $47 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.68 versus a loss per share of $0.17 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.81 versus a loss per share of $0.09 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 13% in fiscal 2020, TurboTax units grew 11% and our retention rate increased again this year for our online tax customers. There are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. Based on the latest IRS data through July 24th, we estimate total returns including paper filings grew 3% to 4%. This excludes approximately $7 million to $8 million stimulus-only filings. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using Do-It-Yourself software. Excluding stimulus-only filings, we estimate category share grew over 2 points this season, the fastest pace in 15 years. As a reminder, the DIY category growth is our largest revenue growth lever. The third driver is our share within DIY, excluding stimulus-only filings, we estimate our share of total tax returns grew over 1.5 points and our share of the category was flat. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. The growth reflects the stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and minor price increases in the premier product and state attached. Turning to the Strategic Partner Group, we reported $493 million of professional tax revenue in fiscal 2020, up 4%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed group, revenue grew 16% during the quarter and 15% in fiscal 2020, including nonrecurring PPP revenue. Excluding PPP, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 13% during the quarter and 14% in fiscal 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on small businesses. Online Ecosystem revenue remained resilient, with growth of 29% during the quarter and 31% during the year, including nonrecurring PPP revenue. Excluding PPP, Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% in fiscal Q4 and 30% in fiscal 2020. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Last quarter, I shared recent business trends and I'd like to update you on those same trends compared to pre-COVID levels in the first half of the third quarter. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and to a lesser extent mix shift. During the fourth quarter, QBO new customer acquisition accelerated by approximately 10 points versus the second half of the third quarter, but it's still down 5 points from pre-COVID levels. Retention within the existing customer base improved during Q4, but full year QBO retention is down two points to 77%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue grew 21% in fiscal Q4 driven by payments, PPP loans, payroll and Time Tracking. Excluding non-recurring PPP revenue, Online Services revenue grew 12%. Within Payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offerings. The number of workers paid was roughly flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter, improving from a 10% year-over-year decrease during the second half of the third quarter, but still 20 points below pre-COVID levels. Similarly, the number of companies running Payroll grew approximately 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, improving from flat year-over-year in the second half of the third quarter. This is still 5 points below pre-COVID levels. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Payment charge volume grew 15% in the fourth quarter, improving from flat year-over-year in the second half of the third quarter. This is still 15 points below pre-COVID levels. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4. Total international online revenue grew 31%, reflecting subscriber and ARPC growth earlier in the fiscal year. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 3% in the fourth quarter and roughly flat for the year. Excluding nonrecurring PPP revenue, Desktop Ecosystem revenue was flat in the fourth quarter. The decline in Desktop units moderated in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Intuit helped facilitate more than $1.2 billion in Small Business loans from the Paycheck Protection Program through QuickBooks Capital. This resulted in approximately $30 million in non-recurring revenue in the fourth quarter. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, though we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment. During the fourth quarter, we refocused our investments to ensure our capabilities are aligned against our AI-driven expert platform strategy and Big Bets. This resulted in the departure of over 700 employees and a one-time charge of $43 million in both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We plan to hire about 700 employees in our most strategic areas including systems, full staff and beta engineering, data science, customer success and sales. Turning back to our financial principles, our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $7.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. In June, we issued $2 billion in senior notes to fund a portion of the Credit Karma acquisition and for other general corporate purposes. These notes carry a blended coupon rate of 1.15%. Following the end of the quarter, we repaid the $1 billion balance on our revolver. We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter, as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market in the future. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable October 19, 2020. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, while we are not providing company level guidance today reflecting uncertainty in Small Business trends, we believe the current environment accelerated our consumer results this season, creating a more challenging comparison for next year. We see several scenarios for how the economic recovery may impact our Small Business performance and that we are considering as we run the business. The first scenario is that the pace of economic recovery continues at its current pace, reaching normalized growth in the spring of 2021. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew high-single digits. The second scenario is a more gradual opening of the economy, including ongoing headwinds from Small Business failures. This W-shaped recovery assumes cases increase during the winter months coinciding with our peak season in the U.S. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grow mid-single digits. The third scenario is a choppy recovery and more than one wave of Small Business failures or shutdowns, creating a double W-shaped recovery. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue flat-to-up low-single digits. In addition, we expect a slower Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth in the first half, as compared to the second half of fiscal 2021. We supported customers during the second half of 2020 by delaying price increases, migration to our new payroll offerings and upgrades to QBO Advanced. As a reminder, we began rolling out a QBO price increase in first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will start lapping the full impact of that increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Keep in mind that there is also a lagging impact to QuickBooks Online accounting revenue from the slower customer acquisition and higher attrition we experienced during third quarter. To reiterate, our long-term expectations include revenue growth of 8% to 12% for the Consumer Group and 10% to 15% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. We continue to expect Online Ecosystem revenue growth of more than 30% longer term. Lastly, we expect a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2021. And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. Thanks, Brad. I hope you are doing well too. I would say a couple of things, what Sasan just said applies to your question. Our strategic focus is not changing. We continue to focus on expanding our lead in DIY and also transforming assisted with the TurboTax Live product. There may have been some -- a little bit more of a challenge this year, more people filing from home. But we think that there's just a large opportunity for us to continue to focus on our strategy of bringing folks into the category and bringing folks into TurboTax Live. We are really proud of the progress we have made this year with the 70% increase in customers and we do believe that we will continue to build on the tailwinds from this year. Thanks, Ken. Yes. We are really proud of the work that the team did utilizing our platform and our modern technology to be able to turn so quickly to provide $1.2 billion in access to PPP loans for our Small Business customers in such a rough environment.  As for margins, I would say, we really do manage our margins at the company level and that's really how we think about this $30 million of revenue. Also, I would tell you that, given the environment, the tightening of credit that we had done, this was really more of a trade-off for the QuickBooks Capital team and really putting the majority of their focus on PPP versus extending credit through QuickBooks Capital."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Thanks, Kim. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. I hope you are all safe and well. We had a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a dynamic fiscal year 2020. Full year revenue grew 13% and operating margin expanded. Total revenue growth was fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, and 13% growth in the Consumer Group. QBO and TTO platform revenue totaled $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2020, growing 22% year-over-year.  With our AI-driven expert platform strategy and the focus on our five Big Bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation in the current environment, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. Since we just finished tax season, let's start there. This tax season was like no other and our team delivered a strong season in an uncertain environment by executing on our strategy of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category, transforming the assisted category, and disrupting consumer finance. Based on our estimates, excluding stimulus filings of approximately $7 million to $8 million, the Do-It-Yourself category share grew over 2 points this season. We grew our share of total returns and posted 11% customer growth, the strongest in four years, while growing revenue double-digits for the third year in a row. We grew the base of customers paying us nothing just over 20%, posted double-digit growth of new customers across underpenetrated segments including Latinx, Self-Employed and customers with investments, and we grew TurboTax Live customers nearly 70%. Now turning to Small Business, revenue for the Small Business and Self-Employed group grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the year. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter, including 4 points of nonrecurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program and 31% for the year. We are seeing the resiliency of our platform following a different demand earlier this year when shelter-in-place shutdown many Small Businesses. We are now seeing recovering trends across our platforms, including improved retention rates, payment volumes and employees paid with our payroll offerings, as customers continue to rely on QuickBooks as the source of truth for their business. With that said, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in the market, particularly for Small Businesses as the pandemic continues to run its course. Next, I will turn to the progress of our AI-driven Expert Platform strategy and how we are executing against our five Big Bets. These Big Bets focus on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I will cover big bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other bets. Big bet number two is Connect People to Experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence to do their own taxes and to manage their business. We are connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, allowing us to reach more customers, deepen our engagement, and grow ARPC. Within TurboTax Live, we had a terrific season. The number of TurboTax Live customers grew nearly 70%. We provided new ways for customers to access an expert throughout the filing process, contributing to first-year retention and conversion rates increasing several points. And almost 70% of new TurboTax customers who used our Live offerings came from an assisted method the prior year, a higher percentage of TurboTax Online. For experts on our platform, we saw higher satisfaction scores and lower attrition as we focused on improving the expert experience. For QuickBooks Live, we are proud of the progress we have made this year building on the virtual expert platform we created for TurboTax Live. With the rapid adoption of virtual solutions, we continue to see encouraging early signs for QuickBooks Live as we further develop the offering with a higher percentage than expected of customers upgrading to a monthly subscription from our setup offering we introduced in January. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions by connecting customers with financial offerings that help put more money in their pockets. In its third season, we more than doubled monthly active use for Turbo and increased customer retention rates as we grew registered users by 8 million to 22 million. This suggests customers are finding value from our recently introduced innovations such as refund tracking and goal setting. We expect our pending acquisition of Credit Karma to be more important than ever in this challenging environment as we work to help consumers save money, get out of debt and have faster access to money. We continue to expect the transaction to close the second half of calendar year 2020. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of Small Business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence, and grow in an omnichannel world. We recently launched QuickBooks Cash, a Small Business bank account that provides full visibility into Small Businesses current and future financial picture with the ability to move money instantly and to ensure this money is working for them, while leveraging the built-in accounting capabilities of QuickBooks.  The cash account earns an attractive interest rate and enables Small Businesses to set aside funds for upcoming expenses and envelopes and comes with a debit card. It's fully integrated with QuickBooks Payment and Payroll, enabling a Small Business to pay a worker or vendor the same day they receive the funds from a customer. It also includes an integrated cash flow planner to predict future cash needs. We are very excited to learn fast and scale this new innovation. We continue to support our Small Business customers by helping them access the Paycheck Protection program or PPP in QuickBooks Capital. As of July 31ST, Intuit helped make available just over $1.2 billion of approved Small Business loans to customers. We have helped approximately 37,000 Small Businesses access the loans with an average loan of nearly $38,000, keeping over 220,000 employees on payrolls. Finally, following the announced acquisition of TradeGecko's robust inventory and order management system, we look forward to sharing more with you at Investor Day about how we will integrate these capabilities into QuickBooks to help Small Businesses manage and grow in an omnichannel environment. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the Small Business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, designed to address the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees. Throughout the last year, we introduced features to help customers individually tailor the offerings to their needs, including workflow automation, build your own dashboard, custom fields for expense transactions, and batch invoicing and payments. We also continue to work closely with partners to establish deeper integrations with premium apps with the goal to save our customer's time by personalizing the offering and improving their experience. Now more than ever, a simple flexible cloud offering is needed by mid-market customers at a disruptive price. Let me wrap up our Big Bets by circling back to Big Bet number one, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customer's pockets, eliminate friction, and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. Here are a couple of examples of the progress that we are making. First, we accelerated use of AI and increased the number of models deployed across our platform by over 50% this year. This increased use of AI drove a variety of customer benefits, including saving customers 25,000 hours with self-help and cutting expert review time in half, improving customer confidence.  Second, we completed the migration of our data centers to the cloud, while expanding our core technology capabilities. This enables us to decrease downtime by 30%, tripled the speed of delivery on our modern development platform and increased mobile applications deployments by 60%. We can now launch new features in a fraction of the time it once took to deliver customer benefits with even greater speed. As I shared earlier, we believe the current environment is acting as an accelerant for these bets. Most everyone is looking for virtual solutions, Small Businesses are accelerating their shift to online and omnichannel commerce, and both consumers and small businesses are looking for ways to put more money in their pocket. To wrap up, I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments this year. We remain focused on what matters most to our customers and what we can control during this time of uncertainty. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thanks, Michelle. I am very proud of the team and all that we have accomplished together in fiscal year 2020. We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact on the world, as our mission has never been more meaningful than now to power prosperity around the world. I look forward to sharing with you how our strategy of an AI-driven expert platform and our five Big Bets are accelerating innovation at our virtual Investor Day on September 23rd. Let's now open it up to your questions. Sure. Thanks, Brad. I hope all is well with you my friend. So let me -- I am aware of the stats, maybe if I can just touch on history and touch on how we think about the future. If I take us back to the recession in 2008 and the way that played out in \u201808 and \u201809, what we saw in filings was they were kind of flat to down just a little bit. And so even in very tough times, you saw a general flat environment when it came to number of filings. Now, these times are a bit different than \u201808 and \u201809, but history is always important to look at. When we look ahead, a couple of things, one is unemployment was very low at the beginning of this fiscal year and unemployment also gets taxed. And so when we think about 2021 and beyond, there may be -- the filings maybe down a bit, or they may be close to flat. It does not at all change our strategic focus. And just as a refresher we are really focused on expanding our Do-It-Yourself category. There's still a massive opportunity that I believe we are just getting started and transforming the assisted category. And so when you look at our penetration and the assisted category when you look at the opportunity we still have in expanding the Do-It-Yourself category, we believe that the long-term expectations of what we have set around 8% to 12% Consumer Group revenue growth still stands. So that's how we think about the couple of years that are upcoming given the number of folks that are unemployed. One thing I will add, oh, sorry, Brad. Just one thing I would add that's complementary to what Michelle just shared. The facts are always friendly, right? And when you think about those 86 million folks in the assisted category, it's a $20 billion TAM and this is now heading into our sort of fourth year in transforming the category. We have not really even hit the inflection point of what's possible, so just it's an important reminder that we are in the early days of transforming the assisted category. Okay. Thank you, Brad. Sure. Ken, I hope you are doing well. In terms of the question around e-commerce, I think, the place I would start is one of the companies' five Big Bets is about being the center of Small Business growth with a particular focus on transforming omnichannel commerce. And the biggest thing that we have found in all homes and the tests that we have run this past year is for our customers is actually quite easy to launch on new channels, whether it's Etsy, whether it's Instagram, whether it's Facebook, Amazon. The biggest challenge they have is they actually choke their growth, because they really lose sight of which customers are coming from which channels, the profitability, the connection to their inventory and ultimately fulfillment. So the worst thing for a Small Business, particularly the ones that we serve is not being able to fulfill an order. So really our focus is to truly be an agnostic open platform to partner with the channels that are out there, again, the ones that I mentioned, also partner with those that provide websites and also the PLS providers, while really focusing on the core of what matters most to our customers and our core competency, which is around helping customers -- our customers with understanding the profitability by channel, connecting them to inventory. And so our acquisition of TradeGecko is, I think, a huge first step and we will share what we are launching at Investor Day, that really focuses on inventory order management and allows our customers to really take control of the thing that right now they don't have control of to give them the confidence to then open up across other channels. And so we will not only share what we are launching at Investor Day, but we will also reiterate the vision and where we are headed, what you can expect from us in the years to come. But this is a really important first step given all the work that we have done in the last year to be positioned to go after the, I would say, the highest order problem that our customers face. Thanks, Ken. Yes, Robert. Sure. I think, the way you ought to think about it is when you put yourself in the shoes of the Small Business. There's a few things that they need to be able to do. They depending on their products, may want to get set up on what we call mega channels. Again, it could be the walmart.com, Etsy, Amazon, Instagram. They may want to be able to also have their own store set up. They may want to ensure that they have a PLS provider to be able to transact with customers in a physical world. So then they also need to be able to manage all of their financials. They need to understand the profitability of their customers. It's got to be connected to inventory, so inventory can automatically remind them that they are about to run out of inventory and to order more and to be able to fulfill their orders on time and so shipments and delivery on time. And also ensuring that their accounting is done right, that they are compliant and if they need access to money and loans, that they have that ability, and in that context of making sure, when you think about our platform, we have really been positioned over the years to deliver for service based businesses and this is an area where we believe we have a right to win to deliver product for product based businesses when it comes to financial compliance. So right now our initial focus is really just nailing order management and inventory management. It's actually critical to ensuring that our customers have the confidence they can fulfill orders and actually understand their profitability, while we then establish partnerships beyond that with some of the channels that, I mentioned, the PLS providers and even some of the website builders. We truly want to be an open agnostic platform to focus on the problems that matter most and we believe an open platform is necessary to be able to ensure that customers have choice in how they choose to run their business. So initial focus is inventory and order management and this is really about rapid testing, experimentation and scaling what works well, and that's the way we are thinking about it. We have as you heard Michelle talk to, we have experienced really all of our key trends improve and retention specific to your question has improved from what we talked about last quarter. We do expect that it will be down approximately 2 points for the year, but we have seen an improvement over the last quarter. And I think more broadly, I would say, that being the source of truth for our customer's business has always been the case, but I think this pandemic has actually even made us more relevant because the shift to online whether it's payments, payroll, accounting, compliance, it's just become even more critical than it was four months or five months ago and so that over time may actually even impact retention more so. But we expect to be down 2 points for the year, and again, the trends have improved. You are very welcome. Yes. Sure. Good to hear from you, Siti, and thank you for your kind words. We are really proud of the progress in TurboTax Live. Just as a reminder, one of the biggest things that we learned last year was we needed to really improve the first-time experience and the first user experience for our customers. We need to make sure that they had really access to an expert throughout the offering and actually reminding them that they have an access to an expert along the way. And on the other side, making the experience just really drop-dead easy for our experts, making sure that at the fingertips of our experts is insight for our customers from the moment they engage them, whether it's through chat or through video that they can resolve their issue. This is really -- this is a digital platform and it's a service offering. So the experts play such a critical role in the experience. And I would tell you that across the Board, the metrics that we look at are retention, conversion. It's PRS, product recommendation score for both the customer that is using the platform and also the experts. The happier the expert is, the more they feel they can solve the customer's problem, the higher in essence the recommendation score they give. And then we also look at efficiency, are they effectively able to solve the customers' problem? And across the Board, across every metric, it's been up and to the right, and so we have a lot of confidence. We are better this year than we were last year and I have every bit of confidence that we will be better a year from now. But across all of those key metrics, we significantly improved and so I would just expect our momentum and the kind of focus that our employees have on our customers to deliver better experiences, both our customers and our experts. So that's a little bit of a snapshot as to the progress that we have made up and to the right on all of the key metrics. Yeah. One of the things that we have seen and we are fortunate that our Big Bets are the core of the shift, which is we are seeing more and more folks shift to a virtual world. We are seeing more and more folks want to shift to online solutions and omnichannel solutions. And then third is money matters more than ever, whether you are a Consumer, Self-Employed or Small Business. And I think the thing that we are experiencing although to your point that we are not at pre-COVID level yet -- levels yet, many customers are seeing that using our cloud offering gives them the ability to be able to engage with customers in the cloud and to help them avoid interaction in the physical world, higher usage of payments and payroll potentially over time, and frankly being compliant, a lot of customers realize that they weren't compliant and it was hard for them to get access to loans. So I think this environment has just -- we are seeing that shift to the cloud, and I think, that's why we have seen an acceleration in our acquisition compared to where we were just a quarter ago, although still below the pre-COVID levels. You are very welcome. Be safe. Sure. Kirk, good to hear from you and I hope you are safe and well. Particularly in the area that you asked the question, we are actually the low-cost alternative both with QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced. When you look at QuickBooks Advanced, first of all, this is one of the teams that just is innovating at a very rapid pace to ensure that our mid-market customers have all the capabilities that they need to be able to run their business, whether it's something we have built or other apps that our partners build on our platform, but in a very disruptive price. So I would say in some ways, QuickBooks Advanced becomes even more attractive than otherwise in this current environment because we are the low cost provider. And I would say the same thing for QuickBooks Live. These are folks that ultimately come to us that have been using bookkeepers and accountants and they are very dialed into what they have been paying and they really come to us because of the experience that they have had potentially with their bookkeepers and accountants, whereas we have a set of standards around what we expect in terms of the experience that our bookkeepers need to deliver for our customers. And so in that case, we also tend to be the low-cost provider and so we have become even more attractive in an environment like this. So that's the way we think about pricing. We believe that in these two areas, we are actually probably more attractive choice than others. Sure. Absolutely. From a geographic perspective, I would say, the U.S. is probably holding up the strongest, probably next followed by Canada and then the U.K. But I would say, U.S. is held up the strongest and I think a lot of it just has to do with the nature of how the health crisis is being managed and how open the economy is, because all these Small Businesses have one commonality across the world. They are passionate about what they do and it's the way they earn their living, but with that said, U.S. has been the strongest. And of course, from the trends perspective, as you heard from Michelle, we have seen across the Board our trends improve and now stabilize. They are not at pre-COVID levels. But I would say solid improvement just in the last three months as the economy has opened up a bit. Thank you. Very welcome. Yeah. Sure, Brent. Good to hear from you, and again, I hope you are safe and well. First of all, I would start with the point you made which is exactly right. At the end of the day, getting a store set up to be able to do business, you have to be able to accept payments, you have to -- you want to hire contractors or full-time employees, you have to use payroll, especially if you are a younger smaller business, you need access to loans and so then you need to make sure that you are compliant. And so that's where all of our services come in and why they -- why even in this environment as we look ahead, our services become even more critical to ensure a customer can be organized, get paid and run their business profitability. So with that as context, I think, the second context I would just bring up is, it is remarkable how resilient our platform and business model is. You saw what happened last quarter when we talked about some of the trends and how the trends had kind of fallen off given that we shutdown the economy in the U.S. and how they have bounced back. Again, all still not to pre-COVID levels but they have bounced back. And so really to, I think, the second part of your question, the way we are thinking about the future is in context of what you heard from Michelle. If the economy continues on the track that it's on and gets to normalized levels in spring of 2021, as long as Small Businesses are able to do business, I think, our platform is going to benefit. So a lot of our performance because the platform is resilient, the business model is resilient, it's more than ever it's times like this when customers need our platform. I think a lot of it will just depend on how the economy opens up because we are in the cloud, we have capabilities in the cloud, and our customers need our capabilities plus we are an agnostic platform. We believe the way you deliver for customers is to have partnerships with all these key players and I just think that that advantages our network, but that's the way we think about it. Very welcome. Yeah. Very good question. And it's actually we think about the category very differently now than we did four to five years ago and for us it's about the entire category of filers and not just about the Do-It-Yourself category. So just if I could refresh us on the fact that the do-it-yourself category is about $6 billion TAM, the assisted category is about $20 billion in TAM, and of course, what we declared in consumer finance is north of $55 million in the TAM. And so for us, what is most important is the share that we have in the entire category and so we are very, very pleased with the fact that our share of the entire category is up 1.5 points and that is really how we measure success, and that is really our goal line, because when you think about the dollar share of the Do-It-Yourself category, we have the majority of the share, we are focused on the assisted category, whether it's $20 billion of opportunity for us. You are very welcome. So a couple of things I would say, one is, it is inspirational and remarkable how resilient Small Businesses are and how they are looking to adjust how they can still serve their customers. And I would just say, that's an uber point where if one door shuts for them, they open up another door to figure out if there is a different way to serve their customers. So that's really important to recognize and as long as they can manage their task load, they are going to find other ways to be able to serve their customers, which really gets to the second point and that is I think there -- it's become very apparent, one, how meaningful and relevant we are in this environment to help our customers operate in the cloud. There was an element of well, I can just manage through multiple different, use paper and pen and my bookkeeper to run my business. I think people are now seeing, hey, what, I can be far more effective invoicing and getting paid instantly, being able to do payroll and ensure that I am accurate in my payroll, so I am not paying penalties or ensuring that I am organized, so I understand my task force, especially with a lot of launches that we talked about with our QuickBooks cash and cash flow planner to be effective. So I think what you are seeing is I have an opportunity to much more effective and efficient with my cash flow using Intuit's platform and the cloud, and the resiliency of our Small Businesses just finding new and unique ways to do business, while we are I think experiencing the bounce back relative to the last quarter. Again, reminding us though that they are still not at the pre-COVID levels. Very welcome. Sure. Yeah. Sure, Scott. Good to hear from you. Hope you are well. I would focus on the fact that we truly manage investments and margins at the company level. What really matters most is that we delivered 13% revenue and 17% operating income both GAAP and non-GAAP and EPS grew 16%. And so our leverage is more and more at the company level, because we are truly more and more building services across our platform at the company level. And so margin levels moving up or down a point, I wouldn't get overly excited about it at the segment level, because of the fact that we are making our investment choices the way we are running the company is more and more at a platform across the company. So I would really look at company level performance and not just segment level performance because of how we are making our investment choices and we are getting a lot of leverage because of the way we are doing it. Sure. Absolutely. So let me just first share with you the objectives that we have that we shared in previous years when it comes to taxes. One is, we are a big believer in voluntary tax. Two, we are a big believer that those that are deserving whether it's income levels and military and we want to make sure that they can get their taxes done for free and in some cases philosophy. And last but not least is, we always want to enhance our reputation, so that's kind of one bucket of objectives to think about. The second is our strategy and it's very much intertwined. When we talk about the notion of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category transforming the assisted category and disrupting consumer finance, the core part of our strategy is actually for those that deserve it to give them the ability to do their taxes for free because over time they can not only grow with us but also we can solve other problems beyond tax. So that's the way we think about our strategy, that's the way we think about our innovation and we are very dedicated to helping those that deserve it most to get their taxes done for free. So that's -- those are the things that ultimately inform how we think about SLK. Yeah. Sterling, thank you for the question. First of all, we don't break out what the percentage of our base is that uses Payroll. But what I would share is some of the stats and take you back to some of the stats that Michelle shared, which is, we have actually seen a nice bounce back of companies in essence running Payroll. It's still below pre-COVID levels, but we have seen a nice bounce back. And they have less employees but the number of companies running payroll has bounced back nicely. I think that's one indication that we look at. I think the broader indication that we look at is really cash flow and when we look at across our base, remember, 70% of our base of service-based businesses, whether it's real estate, landscaping, bookkeeping, computer and software. We look across who we serve and we also look by state, which is very different. We are seeing a nice bounce back in places like North Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey and Arizona, but on the other hand states that are recovering slower New York, California, Michigan, just to give a couple of examples. And when we look across industries and across those states, this is based on our own analysis of those that have connected to QuickBooks their bank accounts. We see their bank averages could range from being down 10% to up towards 20%. So what we really monitor is cash flow, because that is ultimately the biggest indication as to whether or not are they going to be able to make it through these times and that is really what we are -- what informs some of the indicators that you heard Michelle talk to. And last but not least, we expect our retention to be down about 2 points this year given some of what we experienced with our customers being shut down. You are very welcome. Yeah. Jen, thank you for your question and hope you are well and safe. We have never lacked conviction around TurboTax Live. We believe that we are just at the beginning of really creating a platform that goes viral, because the more people that do their taxes digitally with help coming to them in any frame that they need it, whether it's in their home or in their office, the more they are going to tell others and the more this will go viral. And I think, as I have shared before, based on the research and work that we have done, out of the 86 million folks that use an assisted method, about 70 million or so are willing to switch. So our focus has been experimenting, learning, looking at our results both in terms of how we raise awareness, how we bring folks into consideration and then the experience that we deliver on the platform. And I would just tell you that a year later we are a lot better than we were this time last year, particularly this extended tax season, albeit we all wished it would have ended in April given the tax put on our employees. We were able to actually experiment for another three months. So we ran a lot of tests on our platform and both in terms of how to raise awareness but also how to really nail the experience when customers come in. And as I mentioned earlier, all of our metrics, conversion, retention, PRS for both customers and our experts were all up and to the right. So based on what we learned this year, not just the results, but more importantly the learning, that actually gives us a lot more conviction of what we need to do for this coming tax season and even beyond. And so we feel blessed with the insights of learnings and we will absolutely be leaning in. But not just because of our results. We have had a lot of conviction, but just because of our learnings it allows us to be clear in terms of where we point our innovation. You are very welcome. Yes. Michael, thank you for your question and I also hope you are safe and well. Let me hit on two things. I mean, I think, one, what I would say based on history. We know that we are a globe of entrepreneurs. And sometimes it's out of passion for an idea that you have and sometimes it's because you need to figure out a way to create income. And so at the end of the day, we don't build our business on hoping that there will be a lot of SMB new starts, but certainly in an environment like this could be a trigger for new Self-Employed and Small Businesses, and we certainly, want to be there for them the moment they have an idea and a passion to pursue something. And as you heard from Michelle earlier, just a lot of it depends on just how we see the health crisis play out and therefore the impact on the economy. On the tax side on your question about the experience that folks may have gotten whether or not they would be unlikely to switch back to their old method. The thing that we have learned over the years, this isn't the first year that we have gotten a lot of our customers from the assisted segment. It all comes down to the experience. And the confidence that they have in doing their taxes right, the confidence that they have in getting their maximum refund and we feel good about the experience that we delivered this year for customers based on our product recommendation scores. And so we also learned a lot in terms of what we need to do to continue to improve our platform. So we would hope that our retention rates play out next year the way they have in previous years, but it's primarily because of the type of experience that we deliver and of course this time next year will be far better in terms of the experiences that we will deliver, that we are even now given our rapid testing and learning mindset. So that's the way I would think about your two questions. Yeah. Very welcome. Thank you. You too. Yeah. Michael, thank you for your question. First of all, I would start with the principles that Michelle talked about earlier and I will just touch on a few of them as a starting point to answer your question, because it is how we run the company. And ultimately our principles are we want to grow revenue double-digits. We want to grow operating income faster than revenue. We want to make sure that we get 15% return on our investments and ensure that we solve our customer's most important problems. In that context and you have heard Michelle and I talk about it in the last year that we are really just continuing to be at the beginning of our platform journey. And that journey really means that we are going to continue to get better at building services one so that they can be used across the company. You heard some of our metrics around 50% increase in the number of AI models we have deployed this year, our velocity being up 3X compared to last year. That's all innovation. But that's also efficiency and effectiveness. And although, we don't set out a specific goal of increasing operating margins, because we want to make sure that we can simply deliver against the principle of operating income growing faster than revenue, I think, the result of becoming more effective and efficient could suggest that over time our operating margins will expand. And as you said yourself, we did actually spend more money in tax this year because of the extended season. It was both in marketing and customer success because we wanted to be there for our customers, because in essence we had two tax seasons in one. So we actually did spend more money. And as you saw, we expanded our operating margins because I think we are starting to see the leverage of our platform and that was not by accident. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you for your question, Josh, and hope you are safe and well. First of all, you said it, we are very, very early. We have been working on this for some time, but we are very early, but we are very excited and I wouldn't think about QuickBooks Cash as a service. I would think about it as a very disruptive way for achieving this notion of truly being the source of truth for a customer's business. And just think about it in terms of a place where you can receive and send money. So when you do work for a customer and you invoice them, it automatically gets dumped into your QuickBooks Cash account where you can in essence have interest that you gain on your money, a place that you can just pay your employees right out of your QuickBooks Cash account, a place where you can buy inventory from your QuickBooks Cash account, a place where you can get access to capital from your QuickBooks Cash account. And while you are doing all that, because it's all happening in your QuickBooks Cash account, the accounting is actually getting done for you and so you don't actually have to do a bunch of reconciliation. That's really what we are focused on really creating in terms of a benefit for our customers and something that customers won't tell you that they need this, but when you really listen to what gets in their way, it's just can I have something that everything gets done for me and that's really the intent of QuickBooks Cash. We are just excited with the launch. We are excited to learn, to adjust, to test and to scale this very fast and it's something that we are going to talk about our virtual gallery walk at Investor Day in September. So hopefully that entices you to show up. It should be fun. Yeah. I would tell you that as tradition would hold for Intuit, we always set very, very ambitious goals for ourselves for the near-term and for the long-term, because it really just forces us to take bigger swings for our customers. So I won't get into how we did versus our internals. But what I would tell you is that we feel truly terrific about the results, because literally on every dimension that you look at it, new customers growing 70%, 70% coming from the assisted segment, conversion being up year-over-year, retention being up year-over-year, PRX being up for our customers, PRX being up for our experts, our experts actually being very efficient delivering the 60 million hours that they engaged with our customers. We are really happy with the end result because it was truly an end to end experience that the team delivered. And we learned a ton, we learned what was not working. We learned how to be more effective. We learned how to deploy our AI models even more effectively, so that we can have the insights at the fingertips of our experts so they can deliver for customers. This is truly a digital service experience and so we are excited for next year and the next five years to come. You are very welcome. Yes. Kartik, good to hear your voice and hope you are also keeping well my friend. So I think the uber point, I would say, is we are just obsessively focused on our customers. When you think about what our teams did in the last 12 weeks with PPP, with the GoFundMe platform that funded $37 million, with our Instant Deposit being free through July. Just to name a few, extending the deferred payment of our QuickBooks Capital customers, those that were really struggling and needed the help. We will make the right choice for our customers, and ultimately, we want to make sure that the value equation makes sense based on the rapid progress of our innovation and the fact that our speed of innovation is up 3x versus last year. So we always want to make sure that the value equation makes sense. But we are just going to see how the health crisis plays out and how the economy plays out and make our pricing decisions based on the principles that we have at the right time and this isn't the time to share when that is, because we really want to see how things play out. But that's principally the way we think about it. Absolutely. And in fact, I would tell you that we play the long game here when it comes to our R&D investments, and as I mentioned earlier, I think, we are just picking up momentum truly operating as a platform company and the innovation that we delivered this year was just -- got accelerated from just even a year ago. And by the way, that's been the trend we have been on for the company for the last 37 years and so we are actually -- we use opportunities like this to accelerate innovation and become much more effective, because we know one day we are going to get the value for it, for our customers and for shareholders. So the short answer or the long answer, I should say is, absolutely yes. Yeah. You are very welcome. Stay safe. Yes. Hi, Brad. Hope you are well and safe. Ultimately, it's the test that we run. It is very similar to what we do in TurboTax and across the Live platform. At the end of the day, it comes down to understanding the benefit that you are delivering and whether or not a customer is willing to pay for it. But we also think about it relative to the impact on retention in the long-term. And so based on those in essence levers that inform the things that we test inclusive of even tests to come where we may choose to have accounting being free but then charge for services. So it really comes down to the experiments that we run and we let the data help inform strategically the choices that we make and that's primarily the way we have operated for years across the company. You are very welcome. Yes. I will. Just wanted to thank everyone for your time and all the great questions today and I want to just close by once again thanking our employees and our customers and partners. We would not be where we are without the incredible stakeholders that we serve and we look forward to seeing all of you at our virtual Investor Day in September. Until then be safe and be well."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.  Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm going to cover four topics on today's call to help you understand our performance in the quarter, and our outlook longer term in context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I'll start by sharing how we've responded to the pandemic with our employees, customers, share our results for the quarter and highlight recent trends in our business. Then I'll put these results in context of our long-term strategy and finish by talking about our playbook for leading in a downturn to accelerate our performance.  Let's start with our response to the pandemic where unprecedented uncertainty, along with widespread shelter-in-place initiatives have changed our daily lives. At the onset of the pandemic, we created an enterprise crisis team to drive four work streams. First, keeping our employees safe and healthy. This has been and will continue to be our number one priority. Second, ensuring that we run the business effectively and continue to deliver for our customers. Third, keeping our workforce engaged and productive. And fourth, supporting our customers, our partners, and the communities where we live and operate. I'm proud of how our employees adapted to this sudden change and how seamlessly we transitioned our 10,000 person workforce around the world to a work-from-home environment. I'm even more proud of how in the face of uncertainty, our employees\u2019 commitment to customers has grown even stronger.  The challenges facing consumers and small businesses during this difficult time have inspired our teams to innovate with speed and apply platform capabilities to help to solve several problems caused by this pandemic. As a result, let me share three examples of how we're helping consumers and small businesses get access to aid and relief.  First, in less than a week following the IRS announcement, we introduced three free stimulus registration tools in partnership with the IRS. These offerings helped more than 10 million Americans not required to file a tax return to easily register with the IRS to get their stimulus money. We're proud to donate our time and expertise to help the IRS quickly disburse billions of dollars in stimulus payments to Americans. Second, we launched Intuit Aid Assist to simplify the process of quickly connecting small businesses to the right relief funding programs based on eligibility. Intuit Aid Assist uses artificial intelligence to distill the complexity of hundreds of pages of the CARES Act and convert it into an easy-to-understand user experience delivering a personalized and actionable recommendation. This new tool is based on the same knowledge engineering, which is used by TurboTax to simplify the tax code. Third, as of May 20th, Intuit helped make available over $875 million of improved small business loans to customers from the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP to QuickBooks Capital.  The team rapidly developed the solution to simplify and automate the PPP loan application process to help to very small businesses access this program. We've helped approximately 25,000 small businesses access loans with an average loan of approximately $35,000, keeping up to approximately 150,000 employees on the payroll. These offerings are a testament to our unique platform and technology capabilities, and we will continue to find new, innovative ways to help our customers during this time of need. Now, turning to the fiscal third quarter results. Through the first part of the third quarter, we saw a continuation of great momentum we built during the first half of the year, when revenue grew 14%. At the same time, the impact of the pandemic on taxpayers and small businesses is real. The extension of the IRS tax filing deadline and local shelter-in-place directive negatively impacted performance beginning in mid-March. As a result, our total revenue declined 8% in the quarter. Let me go into more detail with how the quarter played out, starting with our Consumer Group. The extension of the IRS tax filing deadline from April 15th to July 15th has shifted the timing of millions of tax filings to later in the season, resulting in 15% decline in Consumer Group revenue during the fiscal third quarter. Based on the latest IRS data, total returns are down 9.4%, reflecting the later July 15 tax filing deadline. The do it yourself software category is performing notably better than assisted and as the category leader we're driving category awareness and growth. So we are encouraged by this result. Through May 8, IRS data shows total e-file returns are down 9.6% with self prepared e-files up 2.2% and assisted e-files down 18.8%. Because this data includes stimulus filings for individuals not usually required to file a tax return, it is not comparable to prior year data.  As of May 8th our data also indicates a majority of expected April higher value customers with the most complex returns and those with balance due have yet the file. Therefore, we're proud of our progress so far and feel good about where we stand with the TurboTax online share and ARPC keeping us on track during the last two months of the season. Our strategy is working. We're accelerating our innovation and are well positioned for the remainder of the season.  We're making progress on serving fast-growing under-penetrated segments including Latinx, self-employed and customers with investments. We are focused on increasing customer confidence through access to experts with TurboTax Live and we're seeing a positive impact on both conversion and retention when these customers interact with an expert. The extension of the season has also given us the opportunity to run additional experiments to improve the experience, product lineup and pricing for the future.  Let me turn to small business. We began to see an impact from COVID-19 on our business in mid-March as many small businesses began closing or significantly scaling back their operations, leading to loss of income and rising unemployment. Despite these headwinds, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 11% an Online Ecosystem revenue grew 28%.  Let me share some of the recent trends in our business. During the second half of the quarter QuickBooks online new customer acquisition decelerated approximately 15 points versus the first half and retention within the existing customer base decreased by 2 points versus a year ago. We continue to expect the Small Business customer base and ARPC to grow in fiscal year 2020. The services offerings within QuickBooks Online have experienced an even greater impact. For example, after growing approximately 30% year-over-year through mid-March, payment charge volume was flat year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. Within our online payroll offering after an increase of 20% year-over-year and workers paid through mid-March, workers paid decreased 10% year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. Similarly, after the total number of companies running payroll grew 15% year-over-year through mid-March, the number of companies running payroll was approximately flat during the second half of the quarter. These trends could result in higher attrition and lower revenue in the future.  Despite limited visibility in near term, we are more inspired than ever to achieve our 2025 prosperity, reputation and growth goals. As a reminder, our prosperity goals are at a double household savings rate and improve the success rate of small businesses by 10 points better than benchmark for anyone on our platform. We will do so by becoming an AI-driven expert platform and doubling down on our five big bets. As we look into the future, we have resourced our big bets for acceleration. Let me share our progress on each of these bets.  Big bet number one is foundational to accelerate innovation across our platform. I'll come back to this one in a minute since it supports the other four big bets. Big bet number two is all about connecting people to experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence to do their own taxes and to manage our business. We're connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, allowing us to reach more customers, deepen engagement and grow ARPC. Within TurboTax Live this season, we've improved access to experts through real time chat and a floating live help button, contributing to improving customer conversion and retention.  On the expert side of the platform, we're using AI to improve the experience by automating repetitive tasks, and presenting experts with a contextual customer information, based on the location of the customer within the product experience. As a result, we've seen average session handle time decline nearly 20% this season, while at the same time providing a better experience for our customers. This season, we've earned the highest customer satisfaction scores for TurboTax Live ever. For QuickBooks Live, we're seeing promising early results. With the rapid shift to virtual solutions, we're seeing better-than-expected customer acquisition and we continue to experiment across the line-up. For example, we further refined the Set Up offering we introduced in January. We're seeing an encouraging number of customers who have used the Set Up offering to upgrade their monthly subscription, making us optimistic that's it\u2019s a great way to introduce customers to the benefits of QuickBooks Live. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions for customers by connecting them to financial tools and partners that help put more money in their pockets. In its third season, we're on track to nearly double active use for Turbo. This suggests customers are finding value from our recently introduced innovations like mobile refund tracking and weekly credit card -- credit score updates. And in this challenging environment, our pending acquisition of Credit Karma is more important than ever because we help consumers make better financial decisions. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers sell in an omni-channel world, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We recently launched Cash Flow Planner in QuickBooks Online. Managing cash flow is the biggest problem our customers face, one that is only magnified during this difficult period. Cash Flow Planner is an AI-powered interactive tool that looks at small businesses\u2019 financial history to predict future money in and money out events, enabling a small business customer to forecast its cash needs more accurately. Within payments, we're offering our payments customers free access to instant deposits to put more money in their hands even faster. Since this free offer became available, the volume of payments received instantly by our customers has more than doubled. This offering is in its early days.  Within payroll, we're enabling our small business customers to hold on to their money longer by using our money movement capabilities to pay employees next day. As a result, we've reduced the time between running payroll and paying employees by one-third, driving product recommendation scores up 10%. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the mid market with QuickBooks Online event, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid market customers, who are over-served by higher priced competitive offerings. We introduced several new features to help our customers individually tailor the product to their needs, including building their own dashboard and additional custom fields for expense transactions. We continue to work closely with partners to develop integrations that save our customers\u2019 time and improve their experience. Now more than ever, a cloud offering is needed by mid-market customers at a disruptive price.  Now let me wrap up our big bets by circling back to bet number one, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to deliver benefits to our customers instantly and to make the interactions with our offerings frictionless by accelerating the application of AI. Earlier, I shared several examples of how we're using AI to provide customers access to help through Intuit Aid Assist and PPP funds through QuickBooks Capital or how our customers are accessing funds with instant deposit, managing cash flow with Cash Flow Planner or how we're improving the experience for experts with AI. We are uniquely positioned to use AI to unlock the power of data and service to our customers, both the velocity and impact of our innovation. Now, let me share our thoughts on the bigger picture in the current environment. We expect this environment to act as an accelerant to the best we've declared. First, we expect to see an accelerating shift to our virtual world. This aligns with our big bet to connect people to experts using technology to improve competence. Second, the need for small businesses to increase their online presence and commerce will become more essential, and this aligns with our big bet to be the center of small business growth by providing tools and visibility for customers to better manage their cash flow.  Finally, as we've seen in previous times of hardship, we expect consumers to put a high premium on offerings that can improve their financial health, which aligns with our bets to help consumers unlock smart money decisions. This includes helping our customers with saving more money and getting out of debt and becoming a trusted financial assistant in their pocket with our pending acquisition of Credit Karma. Our strategy in big bets position us better than ever before. We have a proven playbook that focuses our investments on accelerated innovation and what matters most. In that context, we have aligned the company to invest in what's most important for future growth, while delivering against our financial principles. We intend to play offense during this downturn by investing in the largest opportunities for the future, our big bets. When we do our job well, we believe we will come out of this downturn stronger than ever before. To wrap up, I'm incredibly proud of our accomplishments this quarter. We remain focused on what matters most to our customers and those things that we can control during this time of uncertainty.  Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by adding my thoughts on the playbook we're using to run the business during these challenging economic times and then provide an overview of our financial results this quarter. As Sasan shared, we've been through tough economic times before and have developed a playbook of principles for operating in a downturn. These principles are designed to accelerate our execution in the future and help both our customers and Intuit emerge from a downturn in a stronger position than when it began. One of those principles is focusing on controlling what we can, including discretionary spending to deliver bottom-line results, roughly three quarters of Intuit\u2019s expense base is variable over time. We're scrutinizing all expenses and carefully managing what we can control in this environment, such as travel, marketing spend, and hiring decisions.  Let me now turn to our results. As Sasan mentioned, we saw a continuation of the strong momentum we built through the second quarter, during the first half of the third quarter, followed by a slowdown in our business beginning in mid-March. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we delivered revenue of $3 billion, down 8% year-over-year; GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, a 21% decrease; non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 billion an 18% decrease; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.11, a 21% decrease; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.49, a 19% decrease.  Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $1.8 billion down 15% in the third quarter. This decline reflects the delay of the IRS tax filing deadline to July 15th which is shifting revenue out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.  We're pleased with what we've seen season to-date and do-it-yourself category continues to grow faster than assisted and we feel good about where we stand with TurboTax Online\u2019s share. With two months still to go in the season it's difficult to know if these trends will continue or whether more consumers will choose to file an extension. Either way, we expect the DIY category to gain share again this season as it has for more than a decade. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenues declined 18% in the third quarter reflecting the impact of the delayed tax filing deadlines on the timing of consumer tax filings completed by accountants.  We grew Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue 11% during the third quarter, driven by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 28%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally.  Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 36% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and to a lesser extent, mix shift. During the second half of the quarter, we saw the pace of new customer acquisition and retention both decline, especially among lower ARPC customers. Keep in mind that there is a lagging impact to QuickBooks Online accounting revenue, although we do expect both our subscriber base and ARPC to grow during fiscal year 2020.  Second we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue which includes payroll, payments, time tracking, and capital, grew 16% in fiscal Q3. Within payroll we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full service offerings. Roughly two-thirds of online payroll revenue is generated from monthly subscription fees and one-third is generated from per employee monthly fees. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume for customers. During the second half of the quarter charge volume decelerated. Fewer workers were paid and fewer companies ran payroll. These leading indicators could result in higher attrition and lower revenue for these offerings in the future.  Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue, again, grew over 50% reflecting subscriber and ARPC growth earlier in the fiscal year. However, this momentum has slowed and could resolve in decelerating revenue growth in the future. Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined to 6% in the third quarter. Desktop units declined sharply, reflecting lower sales through the retail and direct channels beginning in mid-March. This was offset by mid single-digit QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue growth.  Within our desktop payroll offering nearly 10% fewer workers were paid during the second half of the quarter versus a year ago. This compares to growth in the mid single-digits during the first half of the quarter through mid-March. Desktop payments charge volume growth declined just over 20% in the second half of the quarter. As we shared, Intuit is helping small businesses to obtain loans from the Paycheck Protection Program through QuickBooks Capital. We're working in partnership with an SBA approved bank and we're also directly funding a portion of these loans. We don't expect to hold these loans on our balance sheet and revenue from these loans was immaterial during the quarter. Let me turn to our pending acquisition of Credit Karma. We expect the acquisition to be accretive over time. But given the current environment, we don't have visibility into whether it will be neutral to accretive in the first full fiscal year after closing. We continue to expect the transaction to close during the second half of calendar year 2020, and we're excited about the unprecedented benefits we can deliver together for customers. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investments greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities as a company, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, although we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment.  Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On May 7th, we drew down the full amount of our $1 billion revolving credit facility to maintain financial flexibility. We repurchased $40 million of stock in the third quarter, but have temporarily suspended share purchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition, as is typical during a stock transaction. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market in the future.  The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share payable July 20, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. We will not be providing guidance today. As a reminder, we withdrew our fiscal 2020 guidance earlier this month, reflecting uncertainty in current small business trends. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks, Michelle. We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact on the world during this time. I'm proud of the actions that we've taken as a company to support our customers when they need us most. We've acted with speed, enabled our employees to be safe and productive working from home and continuing to innovate for our customers. We're using our capabilities to rapidly deploy solutions to help consumers and small businesses access the products and relief that they need during this fiscal time. I'm confident we will emerge an even stronger company.  So, with that, let me turn it over to you Latif.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne : Sasan maybe just to start with you. When you think about sort of this environment and what you all have to do to sort of help your client base out, is there anything you've done differently I guess in terms of either invoicing duration or obviously discounting? I guess, just how do you think about sort of, in balance, really the short-term versus the long-term? Obviously, you mentioned that the shift towards virtual is clearly going to happen faster and I think nobody would argue with you about that. But can you just talk about sort of how you're talking or thinking about your I guess pricing when it gets down to it and invoicing with your clients in this very difficult environment for a lot of them?\nSasan Goodarzi: Let me take it in maybe two ways. One, maybe mid longer term and then the other is the here and now. First of all, we have a playbook for times like this and our playbook is really about focusing on customers, focusing on innovation and putting our investment dollars in the areas that matter the most. But then, as you heard from Michelle, being very diligent in terms of our expense, envelope. With that said, as we look at the long-term, we're actually quite excited about the current environment, not the health element of it, but the fact that it will accelerate folks moving to a virtual world, folks moving to having more online presence and commerce capabilities and then money has always been important. But we believe more than ever, ways to save money and get out of debt is going to be more important than ever before and our big bets are squarely focused on the things that matter the most. And we happen by the way to be going through our one and two year planning process, which literally was happening in parallel of when the pandemic started. And it was at that time where we actually used the opportunity not only to be clear about a conservative investment envelope for our next fiscal year, but to really ensure that we can take the dollars that we have allocated and use them as an accelerant for our bets and we just finalized our one and three year plan internally and have allocated our dollars to the big bets and the ones that matter most, and in fact, again, using it as an opportunity to accelerate. So, we actually feel good about the things that we can control and the things that we need to do for our customers to come out of this even stronger.  With that said, and going to the very today here and now elements of your questions, part of our playbook is ensure that we really bend over backwards and do what's right for customers in this kind of an environment and beyond the innovations that you heard that we kind of turned on a dime to deliver like instant deposit for free, PPP, the free stimulus offerings that we referenced, brought to the marketplace. There are elements of things that we're doing for our customers such as we paused any price increases that we planned. We paused our full service payroll migration, which has significant benefits for customers and those that migrate to it at rave, but we didn't want to have our customers think about payroll migration in a time like this.  As we've communicated in the past, we have in essence launched in you line up in QuickBooks, one element of it being QuickBooks Advanced, which allows us to serve mid-market customers. That comes with very clear lines of number of users, number of invoices that you can pay, the number of transactions. And for now, we've actually paused that important line, where you have to migrate to QuickBooks Advanced, all of which at the right time we will put back in place. But we're being very diligent to do what's right for customers, and we're getting a lot of great feedback from customers, inclusive of some of the discounting that we put in place to acquire new customers in these very uncertain times. So those are just some of the examples of the things that we're doing. We have a proven playbook where really the team is actually getting quite well against it.\nKirk Materne: And if I can ask just a really quick follow-up. I assume given what's going on has really no impact on serve your initial thought process around sort of the integration plan for Credit Karma. Is that correct?\nSasan Goodarzi: It does not. We're actually more excited about what we can do with Credit Karma to accelerate helping customers, save money and reduce debt. So, it has not changed our plans.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nMark Rende: Hi. Mark Randy on for Keith Weiss here. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I want to dig in a little bit to the TurboTax side. So, obviously a big shift in revenues related to the filing extension. But have you guys seen any change in the mix of free files? Was that any reason for the kind of push of revenues? Any detail on the free filing that would be helpful.\nSasan Goodarzi: So, Mark, thanks for your question. First of all, I'll just remind us that, when you look at the categories that we serve, the DIY category is about $3 billion in TAM. The assisted category is about $20 billion in TAM. And then the consumer finance space, which we're going to be able to accelerate serving with Credit Karma is about $57 billion in TAM. In that context, very specifically to your question, this is actually the part of the season that is our strength. Really the revenue that shifted into the fourth quarter is because of the fact that the IRS deadline shifted, and these are actually the more high value customers, the more complex customers and the ones that have balance due, and it's actually are our strength. This part of the season is our strength, because it's our customers with the highest retention over the years. And so, given where we are with the category growth and given that we're the champions of do-it-yourself category with the category growth and what we see with share and ARPC, we feel good about where we are and we're excited about playing our game in the last two months of the season which is our strength. And we've really not seen anything outside of what we would expected from an FSA perspective. So, really the revenue shift is entirely because of the shift in the deadline. \nMark Rende: Excellent. Really helpful. If I could sneak in one quick follow up. So, there's obviously been a big uptake in share gains this season in DIY. How do you expect that? Do you expect it to normalize until the back half of the season as like shelter-in-place kind of restrictions come off and ease and people can go to a tax professional or a CPA or you see this being relatively durable throughout the rest of the season?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, I'll make two comments. One is, I think this pandemic will drive structural and behavior changes across many industries, whether it's education, whether how you get mortgage loans, to how you manage your business, to how you do your taxes. And the great news is we're positioned the well with our digital platform to serve customers with assistance to really take advantage of the opportunity. And there's just simply a tailwind of more and more folks wanting to be able to do their taxes themselves and if they need help to be able to get that assistance in the comfort of their home. We'll have to see how the season plays out. I don't want to second guess whether these current trends will continue or not. But what I would tell you is that the shift to a virtual world probably accelerated by five years across many, many different industries. And I think that will be the same thing that we'll see play out when it comes to doing your taxes and/or helping small businesses manage their books, which is where QuickBooks Live comes into play.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBrent Thill: Many companies have been giving us a little bit of color into the current month on -- and I'm curious if there's any color about what you're seeing from the perspective of April turning into May, any notable items would be helpful?\nSasan Goodarzi: So, what I would say is -- Id just touch on the first couple of weeks in May. We have seen a stabilization. To be specific we've seen stabilization in charge volume, the number of payroll companies that are paying their employees. We've seen stabilization and the number of companies that are tracking their time through TSheets. We've been seeing the same thing with acquisition of new customers and we've seen stabilization on the retention front. And on desktop, we've seen a little bit of an uptick because we deliberately slowed down the communication upgrades to our desktop customers, because the timing of doing so was really right in line with when the pandemic hit. And so now that we've started that communication, there's been a little bit of an uptick. I think what\u2019s really important, if I put all of this in a context, is it\u2019s several weeks of trends. And we want to make sure that we don't portray several weeks of trends into a trend, but we have seen a stabilization in the first two weeks, but we clearly want to see the economy come back and ultimately see small businesses open up and see if that trend continues.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Simmons with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons : So, can you talk about how you've adjusted with the amounts and the timing of your advertising spending and the overall -- across the different segments given the tax season is more spread out this year and other factors? \nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure, Robert. Thank you for your question. Let me make two points. One, when this pandemic hit beyond the fact that we were right in the middle of our two and one year of planning and it was a great opportunity for us to agree to a conservative investment envelope as we look ahead to really continue to build our muscle in terms of prioritization and resource allocation. We also then looked at that here and now and what changes we would make. And we did reduce discretionary funds in areas that we were very comfortable with. Of course travel is a given, but hiring and marketing across the board. And specifically in TurboTax both customer success and marketing, we of course needed to kind of lead time, which the team has done. We have a playbook around this and extended between now and July 15th. And so, we've done that. But I would say overall the company's discretionary spend are down because we lowered it for right reasons, but particularly in tax, we just simply extended it through the end of July. We expect, by the way, just sort of kind of black box that we'll need to spend up to $20 million in both customer success and marketing because of the extension of the tax season to ensure that we're there for our customers, but we've also reallocated dollars from other places in the company to make up for it.\nRobert Simmons: And then can you talk to how the economics of the PPP work for Intuit? Just like what kind of cut of the fees you keep and that sort of thing?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Maybe if I could just ask Michelle to take that.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Absolutely. We haven't talked specifically about the monetization. As Sasan talked about earlier, we did say that we've provided $875 million of PPP Small Business loans, and we're working with an SBA approved bank to fund these loans. We're funding some directly, but it's a small amount and we don't expect to hold those. We will expect to earn about 3% to 4% including servicing on the loans themselves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTsung-Yao Chu: Hi, everyone. It's Yao Chu on for Brad Zelnick. Thank you for taking my question, and thanks for what you're doing for small businesses out there. I have a question as it relates to Intuit Capital and potentially Credit Karma. From my understanding, the business models of these segments rely on the algorithms that are basically a combination of historical behavior and real-time data. One of the criticisms of FinTech is that every crisis is driven from the next and that some of these algorithms may be built in data from the last cycle that may not be so relevant in the current one. As we work our way through this, can you share some thoughts on a couple of things. Firstly, how well these businesses and algorithms are working? And does the value proposition remain intact for these data-centric plays? And where the main gaps or differences in behavior where you may have needed to intervene? And I guess based on that, do you think managing through this crisis inherently increases the value of these assets in the longer-term playing through both the downswing and the recovery?\nSasan Goodarzi : Thank you for the question, Yao, and good to hear your voice, and hope all is well. Let me make a general comment, maybe two general comments and get more specific to your question. I think that first of all, as you know, us and Credit Karma are operating as two separate companies, but what I can tell you from the due diligence that we did, we were very impressed with their machine learning capabilities, their ability to do quality checks to watch for bias, and adjust their models on a daily basis because they use 2,600-plus data points per customer to run their models and so they are always adjusting. But let me, that's in context of the due diligence that we did, and I would just say the second macro point is this is one of the reasons why we believe that this environment is actually an accelerant for us to find ways to help customers put more money in their pockets, save money, and get out of debt because all of the machine learning capabilities that we have and Credit Karma has and that we have that in this current environment, done the right way, actually allows us to adjust our models to better serve customers. Now, let me get more specific I think to your question around QuickBooks Capital. This QuickBooks Capital and the machine learning capabilities and the platform is something that we've been working on for years both cleaning up the data so we can use 26 billion data sources and the 360 information that we have from our customers and with their permission to be able to use to in essence know what loans that they can be able to take on, what capacity, the number of months, and how quickly we can adjust our dial. And one of the things that the team has done that's a wonderful progress is that we do checks for biases. Whether in this environment or in a different environment, we're always checking for biases so we can adjust the model. And the model's built in such a way where we can adjust it on a daily basis so we can learn very, very quickly, and what we see in this environment is that it's actually a great opportunity to accelerate our learning so that we can be much more pinpoint in terms of what we can do for customers and when we can do it for the customers. So I'm proud of our QuickBooks Capital team and what they've been able to actually accomplish, and we're learning and adjusting more daily. And by the way, those capabilities is not just for QuickBooks Capital. We use those same capabilities for Instant Deposit, same-day payments, we use those same capabilities for same-day payroll, and so these capabilities are truly platform capabilities that we can use across the company.\nTsung-Yao Chu : And let me sneak one more quick one in. What are the main constraints in distributing PPP funds faster at this point?\nSasan Goodarzi : I'm sorry. Could you ask your question one more time?\nTsung-Yao Chu : Yes. I know you've distributed about -- a bunch of PPP funds to-date. Can you talk to the main constraints on the ability to distribute the funds faster to your base?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, first of all, we truly admire what the team in Treasury and SBA has done to make these loans available and all of the checks they've had to do on privacy and security to be able to distribute these loans, so they truly deserve an applause for the work that they've done. To get to your question, we actually have been able to move quite fast and quite rapidly because of the fact that we know our customers' data, whether it's QuickBooks and payroll customers or QuickBooks Desktop payroll customers, or Self-Employed that have actually filed their taxes with us and be able to very quickly help them apply for the loan. Really, the biggest inhibitor has been all of these that are applying for the loan and having to wait in line to be able to get the loans approved by the SBA. And so, really that's where the bottleneck is. And by the way, the SBA is actually moving quite fast. It's just the number of loans that's coming out of loan requests and how they have to process it and ensure that they reduce fraud. That's I think probably the most difficult part. But on our end, we've been able to move very, very rapidly and we don't really have too many obstacles in front of us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi : Sasan, you talked about one of the bets is in -- like selling in omni-channel world. In fact, we're seeing small businesses they're trying to have their online presence or moving to more of e-commerce environment. So could you give us some color like how Intuit can help and how big is an opportunity for Intuit for helping SMB moving to online?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you for your question. Again, great to hear your voice, and hope you're safe and sound. When you think about Intuit's base, we serve primarily service base businesses, and one of the core drivers behind our bet number four which is being the center of small business growth and one element of it being really providing transformative experiences to make it easy for our customers to do commerce across multiple channels is to actually be able to accelerate serving and penetrating product-based businesses. But it's interesting what this environment is causing, so now let me get to answer your question in two ways. One is even service-based businesses, they're actually if you remember at Investor Day we shared last year that we have 400 million-plus invoices that our customers send out, but about 12% are payment-enabled. We're actually seeing more and more service-based businesses that are actually looking to make all of their payments payment-enabled so they can actually get paid online faster and be able to get out of the paper world. And so this is having, this is going to over time have an impact on service-based businesses to get out of doing manual payroll and doing it online because they've seen with the Paycheck Protection Program if you can't prove your payroll data, you're not really -- you're not going to be able to be first in line to get a loan. And so, it's going to impact more and more service-based businesses going online which is where our sweet spot is. The second element though is the question you asked which is omni-channel, and really the core problem that we want to solve based on well over a year of conversations with our customers is it's actually quite easy for our customers to get set up on different channels, whether it's Instagram, Facebook, Etsy, Amazon, that's not their biggest issue. Their biggest issue is they lose sight of which customer is coming from which channel, which customer is profitable, are they getting paid on time across the different channels, how that connects to their inventory, because clearly, you don't want to run out of inventory and fulfillment is critical. And so the problem that we want to solve is really if I put it in simple terms, having an app where you can actually see all the orders that came in through all the different channels in one place. You can ultimately over time see the profitability of your payments. It connects to the profitability of your customers. You can see how it connects to your inventory that automatically tells you that you're going to have to fulfill your inventory. We're in the very early stages of solving that problem, but we're very clear on what the problem is and we believe this environment will not only over time help us penetrate service-based businesses but it will position us bet number four, to serve product-based businesses. So that's the way we see it and that's the way we think about it.\nSiti Panigrahi : Yes, thanks for that color. And if I could ask one question on tax. This is unusual tax filing year, now it's shifted to July 15 from April 15, so what percent of the people have usually those file taxes if you exclude the people those who filed for stimulus check, what percentage have now not yet filed and moved to maybe for this quarter, and also, what are the changes you're seeing in terms of TurboTax Live adoption so far?\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure. Well first of all, I'll start by affirming it is a very unusual season because I don't think we've been in a place where tax season has been extended. But in many ways, it's affording us new opportunities because our team is built for times like this and things like experimenting in ways that we otherwise wouldn't be able to. So our team is doing a wonderful job leveraging the current opportunity. If you think about last year, there was 155 million returns filed and I think there's 110-ish-million that have been filed already, and the actual specific numbers are on the IRS website, but nevertheless, that would tell you that you've got 40 million, 45 million customers that still need to file their taxes between now and July 15. So that kind of gives you a feel for what's left to come. In terms of TurboTax Live, we focused this year on improving first-time use. We're really focused on providing more access to experts because when our customers engage an expert, our conversion and retention goes up and we're really focused on improving the expert side of the platform, meaning that experts would contextually know where the customer is, and how to best serve them and help them very, very quickly. And so far, TurboTax Live is really delivering within the expectations that we have had for it, and we've got two months of the most complex filers that are still left to come, and so we're excited to serve as many customers as we can between now and then through TurboTax Live.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong : And thanks for all the good color on the first half/second-half splits. Maybe I'll steer this question toward Michelle. So obviously lots of unknowns in kind of going forward, but as we think about your kind of ability to guide or I guess lack thereof, is this more a matter of kind of magnitude in terms if things could get worse, or just an issue of duration in terms of not understanding how long this might play out? Thank you.\nMichelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Ken. Thanks for the call -- question. First of all, I would say that as Sasan said, we are starting to see a few trends in the business that are stabilizing and he enumerated those a minute ago. But it just doesn't make sense off of two weeks of data to be able to predict going forward, so that is really the biggest issue there. But I would say don't confuse the lack of guidance with a lack of confidence in our business and our strategy. So in fact, we've never been more confident in our business, our strategy of becoming AI-driven expert platform, and the five big bets that we've declared. But confidence doesn't mean certainty, and we're in a very uncertain environment as we've discussed, and so that's actually why we're not issuing guidance. It's really around the uncertainty.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Another one on QuickBooks Capital, if I can? For the loans that you've made for PPP, how many of those customers were brand new and never really used the QuickBooks Capital loan program before? Maybe you can just kind of -- just in terms of repeat usage there would be interested to see if you're expanding the ability on the back-end of this to get people already in your system to use QuickBooks Capital. And then just are there any learnings either from the regulatory or the go-to-market there that could accelerate QuickBooks Capital on the back-end of this? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Thanks for your question, and Kim and/or Michelle will keep me honest on this. Our goal was to serve as many small businesses as we could, and of course, we started with our existing base and I believe that all of the current customers that we served are all existing QuickBooks customers. So I'll get confirmation if I got that wrong, but it's been primarily all existing customers. And I would tell you to the second part of your question, it's incredible the halo effect that we've gotten by all the things that I mentioned earlier, from very quickly partnering with the IRS to launch the stimulus offerings, to what we've done with the PPP program, to what we've done to fund and partner with Go Fund Me, which is a crowd-sourcing platform to help small businesses get access to money, which I think has been almost close to $40 million that small businesses have gotten access to. Just a number of things that we've done has gotten really a lot of attention for QuickBooks as a brand that can help customers. And I think this current environment and what we have to do very specifically around PPP just really made our machine model, machine learning models stronger which allows us to make our services stronger which allows us to really over time, helps us better serve payments, payroll, and ultimately QuickBooks Capital customers.\nDaniel Jester : Great. Thank you. And then on Turbo and Mint, I think you in your prepared remarks talked a bit about engagement. I'm just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color there. Does engagement mean clicks, or does it mean actually going through and purchasing a credit card or a loan through your partner? I'm just wondering if you could give some more color there. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure, yes, absolutely. So what we have seen, more demand, less supply. And so on the demand side means that customers are really interested in their credit score, they're really interested setting goals for their credit score, and learning from us how to improve their credit score by potentially making payments on time or checking on the status of their refund, and of course, more interested in them getting access to whether it's personal loans, credit cards, those sorts of things. What we've seen an impact on is on the supply side, because in this kind of an environment, although the digital platform is the highest return for financial institutions, we've seen some financial institutions pull back temporarily off of the Turbo and Mint platform. But it's also the first place qualitatively that they told us they want to come back to. They're just waiting for the current environment specifically unemployment to stabilize so that they can then come back on to the platform. So higher demand, less supply from a financial institution side, which means less monetization.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon, Sasan and Michelle. Thanks a lot. My first question is during fiscal 2009, the Global Financial Crisis, Small Business was relatively flattish. I think the revenue was down only 1%, and Sasan, I'd love to hear your thoughts, just high-level conceptually about just compare and contrast about that time versus this time, what we're seeing and what could be good case/bad case. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. Well, what I would start with and to build on your point, in '08-'09 time frame, what you in essence saw was in essence, the total number of small businesses that went out of business it upticked a couple of points. The number of businesses that started downticked a couple of points. So there was kind of a 3, 4 point impact on the total number of small businesses. And the second thing I would say is things are in some ways very different than '08 and '09 on two dimensions. One is, '08 and '09 was actually a recession caused by the health of financial institutions. This is a pandemic that's health-driven where in essence, small businesses have been completely shut down. The economy was actually quite healthy, but now it's not because of the shutdown of small businesses, which has also caused a recession. So in some ways, they're very different, but in many ways, the impact that we're seeing is the same, which is customer acquisition as I mentioned earlier has slowed down, retention has down-ticked a few points, charge volume has down-ticked from being up 30 to now it's been flat post-mid-March COVID impact. And so that's the impact of course that we're seeing now, but our business is also very different. We have larger portion of our Small Business is subscription-based and it's in the cloud whereas back then, it was primarily Desktop which sees a sharper decline but also a sharper rebound. So with all of that said, those are the two or three things that from a from/to perspective are different. I would reiterate what I mentioned earlier. We are not trying to second-guess the market or meaning how fast things will rebound or how long this is going to, this impact will stay in place. So we're very focused on our controllables, which is accelerating our focus on our big bets, helping our customers in times like this just to ensure we're positioned to come out of this much, much stronger than when we even went into it.\nScott Schneeberger : Thanks. I appreciate that. And as a follow-up, over on the tax side, just curious what insight you have from the IRS thus far with regard to the stimulus filings? And I believe in your April 13 press release, you said you thought that would be for more than 10 million Americans, but not a very clear number. Do you have an idea what type of impact that number will be on the IRS volume results this year for tax filing? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure. We of course as I mentioned earlier, the numbers -- the stimulus numbers are actually in the current filings and we believe at some point the IRS will hopefully separate them so there's visibility for our investment community, what the actual tax returns are versus stimulus returns. 80% of folks have actually been eligible for the stimulus money. The point that we tried to be clear about earlier is that there are 10 million people that don't typically have to file their taxes that are also eligible, and so they have to go through the stimulus offering to be able to get access to the funds. And we believe at some point by then the tax season, the IRS will in essence flesh that out and communicate what the actual tax returns are versus stimulus filings. What you should be left with is it doesn't change the perspective that we shared about the business. The do-it-yourself category is growing. We're seeing a larger and faster shift to the category. We feel good about where we are relative to our online share and ARPC, and this is the part of the season that's our strength and we're looking forward to finishing the next couple of months out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Michelle, you had mentioned earlier about three-quarters of the expense base is variable and it's taking some actions and been forced into some actions around travel and marketing and hiring. Can you give us a sense on what amount you're saving right now with those things?\nMichelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Brad. Thanks for the question. What I would start with is I would say that we have principles around leading through a downturn and they have been proven out. One of the principles in our playbook, as I mentioned, is really around controlling what we can, discretionary spend, so that we can deliver our bottom-line results. We're looking at all of our expenses. Some of those that are easiest to control though are the travel, some marketing spend and the hiring decisions. I'm personally, along with everyone on Sasan's staff making sure that we're really thinking about what we can do in the short-term. But we're also taking a look at things that may have a longer-term impact, things like our real estate decisions and working remotely. As Sasan also mentioned a little bit ago, we will have some increases in expenses. That's for the tax season, the extended season, about $20 million that's marketing and customer success, but we have been able to offset some of that with the discretionary spend. We haven't given a specific number, but we feel very good about the actions that we've been taking in order to get our spend in-line and set ourselves up for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJosh Beck : Thanks for the question, and congrats on all the great work you've done for your customers. Probably a higher level question for Sasan. You talked about this idea of virtual acceleration and just given your purview and that you see how businesses and consumers are behaving, I'm just wondering if there's any areas where it seems like it could be notably strong on potentially the other side of this pandemic. So any color you can give there would be great.\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. I'll start with what I think all of you see and then I'll make a specific to us, but as I talked a lot of my peers across many different industries whether it's CEOs of companies or investors in many, many companies across many industries, whether it's from how you used to get your workouts in and training, if you went to a trainer and how that is shifting to a virtual world, Peloton being one example of that where it's accelerating to an education world where now you have to figure out how to get your education online to more and more people now shifting to be able to engage for medical help online, so getting your taxes done, to being able to manage your business and bookkeeping, and so we believe that this pandemic will have a structural and behavioral impact in several areas. One is just you're going to first think about how to potentially engage in a virtual world, not in a physical world. It doesn't mean we won't go back to a physical world, but I think this will have a fundamental behavioral impact over time. Two is to ensure that you're doing most of your stuff online whether it's how you do payments, whether it's how you do payroll, whether it's how you conduct commerce, even if you're a service business, moving some of your things to now be able to conduct it online is going to be important. And then more important than ever, how do you ensure that you can save money and reduce debt? So we believe that structurally and behaviorally, those three areas are going to accelerate, and it's anybody's guess by how much. But literally, if you think about it overnight, these areas have shifted and I just think we've progressed five years in this area of moving to a virtual world the area of more being online, and the importance of money, and that's one of the things that excites our leadership team and the whole company around what is possible for us to accelerate to ensure that we can deliver for our customers given these shifts that we're seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Pfau : Thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask on the QuickBooks business if you're seeing any difference in terms of behavior between U.S. customers or international customers and then Self-Employed relative to Small Businesses?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, thanks, Matt. Although our trends were all at the Small Business level, what I would just tell you is we've seen U.S. be a bit more resilient than countries outside of the U.S. and all those metrics that we shared. And then the second thing is on the Self-Employed side, what's interesting is although the macro numbers that we shared which is acquisition being down 15 points before and after, or after COVID, with some of the discounting that we are doing, we're actually seeing interest probably more than before on the Self-Employed side. That of course in no way covers the impact that we're seeing on acquisition, but we're actually seeing what we're looking to learn is are these new Self-Employed businesses being born and they're using our Self-Employed app, or maybe we're doing the analysis and looking at our data. But the bumper sticker is I would say U.S. is more resilient than countries outside the U.S., and we're seeing interesting acquisition trends on SE early days, we need to analyze it to understand where they're coming from. It doesn't change the bigger picture of what we shared, which is post-mid-March we were down 15 points and we've seen that stabilize, but SE is a little bit of a green shoot that we're looking to learn more about.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, our final question for the session comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan : I have a couple of quick questions, and thanks for the extended time that you've spent on the conference call. Really appreciate it. One is, Sasan, what are the indicators you're looking for that Small Business activity could be starting to not just stabilize but starting to pick up some fundamental ground indicators that since you've been in the business such a long time, I'm sure that there are some things you're keenly watching for. I'm just curious what they are. And also, if you could share your thoughts, Michelle or Sasan, how to think about this year's unemployment because it's going to weigh on next year's taxes. I'm curious what are the things that Intuit can do because the story has been that you've been gaining market share every single year, but this year is an exceptionally bad year for unemployment sadly, and I'm curious, what is Intuit going to be doing differently to keep its growth profile as strong as it has been on the consumer tax side going into next year. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure, Kash. Great to hear your voice, and hope you're doing well and safe and sound. Let me start with your last question first, and you're very right. It is sad to see this kind of an unemployment rate and we are all hopeful that at some point things will rebound and folks will be able to get back to work. I think what I would say is because unemployment rate was actually very low through March, and when you get unemployment income, we don't actually foresee an impact to tax next year because you still have to do your taxes because you were employed and you have unemployment income and so which means you have to do your taxes. So we actually do not see an impact from the number of people that will need to file IRS, when I look at the total number of IRS returns, this shouldn't have a dramatic impact for the reasons that I mentioned. The second is we are very focused on how we help serve these customers through our Live platform, and we believe that this could really be an impetus to deliver a great experience to deliver higher confidence and for you to be able to do it from the comfort of your home. So that's the answer to the question around unemployment. Headline news is folks are still going to have to do their taxes because unemployment rate was so low for the first several months of the year and you have to do your taxes because of unemployment income. The second in terms of indicators that we're looking at, I would say there are a few. One is just the number of workers and employees that are for instance tracking their time or are tracking their time through TSheets or getting paid through payroll or the number of payroll companies that are paying their employees. That is one very important indicator for us. The second is just what happens with charge volume. That is a very important indicator because it shows the strength of consumer spending with small businesses and small businesses and small business spending. So that's the second. And then third is the rate of acquisition and the rate of attrition. Those are all the trends that we look at. And I would just highlight one subset of all of this which is how QuickBooks Live performs in this environment. It's less about just QuickBooks Live but the notion of getting help. Although very early days with QuickBooks Live, we've been happy with the as we said earlier, with the acquisition trend that we've seen because more and more folks are not only looking to do things in a virtual world but are actually looking in this time frame to get help to clean up their books to ensure they're compliant and to become far more effective and efficient in how they run their business because again, money matters more than ever before. So those are the three, four indicators that we are looking at, and doubling down on the bets that I mentioned earlier because we believe just there's a huge opportunity to help customers shift to online to help customers shift to a virtual world and to be able to find more ways to put money in their pocket.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, I will. First of all, thank you for everyone's time and for joining today and your thoughtful questions. I would like to just close by once again, thanking our employees for just the incredible work that they've done being by the side of our customers and being empathetic and compassionate for what they've having to go through and also just the partnerships with our partners. I wish all of you on the call well. Please stay healthy. Take care of yourself, and we look forward to talking to you at the next earnings call. Take care, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by adding my thoughts on the playbook we're using to run the business during these challenging economic times and then provide an overview of our financial results this quarter. As Sasan shared, we've been through tough economic times before and have developed a playbook of principles for operating in a downturn. These principles are designed to accelerate our execution in the future and help both our customers and Intuit emerge from a downturn in a stronger position than when it began. One of those principles is focusing on controlling what we can, including discretionary spending to deliver bottom-line results, roughly three quarters of Intuit's expense base is variable over time. We're scrutinizing all expenses and carefully managing what we can control in this environment, such as travel, marketing spend, and hiring decisions.  Let me now turn to our results. As Sasan mentioned, we saw a continuation of the strong momentum we built through the second quarter, during the first half of the third quarter, followed by a slowdown in our business beginning in mid-March. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we delivered revenue of $3 billion, down 8% year-over-year; GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, a 21% decrease; non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 billion an 18% decrease; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.11, a 21% decrease; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.49, a 19% decrease.  Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $1.8 billion down 15% in the third quarter. This decline reflects the delay of the IRS tax filing deadline to July 15th which is shifting revenue out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.  We're pleased with what we've seen season to-date and do-it-yourself category continues to grow faster than assisted and we feel good about where we stand with TurboTax Online's share. With two months still to go in the season it's difficult to know if these trends will continue or whether more consumers will choose to file an extension. Either way, we expect the DIY category to gain share again this season as it has for more than a decade. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenues declined 18% in the third quarter reflecting the impact of the delayed tax filing deadlines on the timing of consumer tax filings completed by accountants.  We grew Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue 11% during the third quarter, driven by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 28%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally.  Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 36% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and to a lesser extent, mix shift. During the second half of the quarter, we saw the pace of new customer acquisition and retention both decline, especially among lower ARPC customers. Keep in mind that there is a lagging impact to QuickBooks Online accounting revenue, although we do expect both our subscriber base and ARPC to grow during fiscal year 2020.  Second we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue which includes payroll, payments, time tracking, and capital, grew 16% in fiscal Q3. Within payroll we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full service offerings. Roughly two-thirds of online payroll revenue is generated from monthly subscription fees and one-third is generated from per employee monthly fees. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume for customers. During the second half of the quarter charge volume decelerated. Fewer workers were paid and fewer companies ran payroll. These leading indicators could result in higher attrition and lower revenue for these offerings in the future.  Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue, again, grew over 50% reflecting subscriber and ARPC growth earlier in the fiscal year. However, this momentum has slowed and could resolve in decelerating revenue growth in the future. Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined to 6% in the third quarter. Desktop units declined sharply, reflecting lower sales through the retail and direct channels beginning in mid-March. This was offset by mid single-digit QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue growth.  Within our desktop payroll offering nearly 10% fewer workers were paid during the second half of the quarter versus a year ago. This compares to growth in the mid single-digits during the first half of the quarter through mid-March. Desktop payments charge volume growth declined just over 20% in the second half of the quarter. As we shared, Intuit is helping small businesses to obtain loans from the Paycheck Protection Program through QuickBooks Capital. We're working in partnership with an SBA approved bank and we're also directly funding a portion of these loans. We don't expect to hold these loans on our balance sheet and revenue from these loans was immaterial during the quarter. Let me turn to our pending acquisition of Credit Karma. We expect the acquisition to be accretive over time. But given the current environment, we don't have visibility into whether it will be neutral to accretive in the first full fiscal year after closing. We continue to expect the transaction to close during the second half of calendar year 2020, and we're excited about the unprecedented benefits we can deliver together for customers. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investments greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities as a company, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, although we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment.  Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On May 7th, we drew down the full amount of our $1 billion revolving credit facility to maintain financial flexibility. We repurchased $40 million of stock in the third quarter, but have temporarily suspended share purchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition, as is typical during a stock transaction. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market in the future.  The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share payable July 20, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. We will not be providing guidance today. As a reminder, we withdrew our fiscal 2020 guidance earlier this month, reflecting uncertainty in current small business trends. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Absolutely. We haven't talked specifically about the monetization. As Sasan talked about earlier, we did say that we've provided $875 million of PPP Small Business loans, and we're working with an SBA approved bank to fund these loans. We're funding some directly, but it's a small amount and we don't expect to hold those. We will expect to earn about 3% to 4% including servicing on the loans themselves. Hi, Ken. Thanks for the call -- question. First of all, I would say that as Sasan said, we are starting to see a few trends in the business that are stabilizing and he enumerated those a minute ago. But it just doesn't make sense off of two weeks of data to be able to predict going forward, so that is really the biggest issue there. But I would say don't confuse the lack of guidance with a lack of confidence in our business and our strategy. So in fact, we've never been more confident in our business, our strategy of becoming AI-driven expert platform, and the five big bets that we've declared. But confidence doesn't mean certainty, and we're in a very uncertain environment as we've discussed, and so that's actually why we're not issuing guidance. It's really around the uncertainty. Hi, Brad. Thanks for the question. What I would start with is I would say that we have principles around leading through a downturn and they have been proven out. One of the principles in our playbook, as I mentioned, is really around controlling what we can, discretionary spend, so that we can deliver our bottom-line results. We're looking at all of our expenses. Some of those that are easiest to control though are the travel, some marketing spend and the hiring decisions. I'm personally, along with everyone on Sasan's staff making sure that we're really thinking about what we can do in the short-term. But we're also taking a look at things that may have a longer-term impact, things like our real estate decisions and working remotely. As Sasan also mentioned a little bit ago, we will have some increases in expenses. That's for the tax season, the extended season, about $20 million that's marketing and customer success, but we have been able to offset some of that with the discretionary spend. We haven't given a specific number, but we feel very good about the actions that we've been taking in order to get our spend in-line and set ourselves up for next year."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm going to cover four topics on today's call to help you understand our performance in the quarter, and our outlook longer term in context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I'll start by sharing how we've responded to the pandemic with our employees, customers, share our results for the quarter and highlight recent trends in our business. Then I'll put these results in context of our long-term strategy and finish by talking about our playbook for leading in a downturn to accelerate our performance.  Let's start with our response to the pandemic where unprecedented uncertainty, along with widespread shelter-in-place initiatives have changed our daily lives. At the onset of the pandemic, we created an enterprise crisis team to drive four work streams. First, keeping our employees safe and healthy. This has been and will continue to be our number one priority. Second, ensuring that we run the business effectively and continue to deliver for our customers. Third, keeping our workforce engaged and productive. And fourth, supporting our customers, our partners, and the communities where we live and operate. I'm proud of how our employees adapted to this sudden change and how seamlessly we transitioned our 10,000 person workforce around the world to a work-from-home environment. I'm even more proud of how in the face of uncertainty, our employees' commitment to customers has grown even stronger.  The challenges facing consumers and small businesses during this difficult time have inspired our teams to innovate with speed and apply platform capabilities to help to solve several problems caused by this pandemic. As a result, let me share three examples of how we're helping consumers and small businesses get access to aid and relief.  First, in less than a week following the IRS announcement, we introduced three free stimulus registration tools in partnership with the IRS. These offerings helped more than 10 million Americans not required to file a tax return to easily register with the IRS to get their stimulus money. We're proud to donate our time and expertise to help the IRS quickly disburse billions of dollars in stimulus payments to Americans. Second, we launched Intuit Aid Assist to simplify the process of quickly connecting small businesses to the right relief funding programs based on eligibility. Intuit Aid Assist uses artificial intelligence to distill the complexity of hundreds of pages of the CARES Act and convert it into an easy-to-understand user experience delivering a personalized and actionable recommendation. This new tool is based on the same knowledge engineering, which is used by TurboTax to simplify the tax code. Third, as of May 20th, Intuit helped make available over $875 million of improved small business loans to customers from the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP to QuickBooks Capital.  The team rapidly developed the solution to simplify and automate the PPP loan application process to help to very small businesses access this program. We've helped approximately 25,000 small businesses access loans with an average loan of approximately $35,000, keeping up to approximately 150,000 employees on the payroll. These offerings are a testament to our unique platform and technology capabilities, and we will continue to find new, innovative ways to help our customers during this time of need. Now, turning to the fiscal third quarter results. Through the first part of the third quarter, we saw a continuation of great momentum we built during the first half of the year, when revenue grew 14%. At the same time, the impact of the pandemic on taxpayers and small businesses is real. The extension of the IRS tax filing deadline and local shelter-in-place directive negatively impacted performance beginning in mid-March. As a result, our total revenue declined 8% in the quarter. Let me go into more detail with how the quarter played out, starting with our Consumer Group. The extension of the IRS tax filing deadline from April 15th to July 15th has shifted the timing of millions of tax filings to later in the season, resulting in 15% decline in Consumer Group revenue during the fiscal third quarter. Based on the latest IRS data, total returns are down 9.4%, reflecting the later July 15 tax filing deadline. The do it yourself software category is performing notably better than assisted and as the category leader we're driving category awareness and growth. So we are encouraged by this result. Through May 8, IRS data shows total e-file returns are down 9.6% with self prepared e-files up 2.2% and assisted e-files down 18.8%. Because this data includes stimulus filings for individuals not usually required to file a tax return, it is not comparable to prior year data.  As of May 8th our data also indicates a majority of expected April higher value customers with the most complex returns and those with balance due have yet the file. Therefore, we're proud of our progress so far and feel good about where we stand with the TurboTax online share and ARPC keeping us on track during the last two months of the season. Our strategy is working. We're accelerating our innovation and are well positioned for the remainder of the season.  We're making progress on serving fast-growing under-penetrated segments including Latinx, self-employed and customers with investments. We are focused on increasing customer confidence through access to experts with TurboTax Live and we're seeing a positive impact on both conversion and retention when these customers interact with an expert. The extension of the season has also given us the opportunity to run additional experiments to improve the experience, product lineup and pricing for the future.  Let me turn to small business. We began to see an impact from COVID-19 on our business in mid-March as many small businesses began closing or significantly scaling back their operations, leading to loss of income and rising unemployment. Despite these headwinds, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 11% an Online Ecosystem revenue grew 28%.  Let me share some of the recent trends in our business. During the second half of the quarter QuickBooks online new customer acquisition decelerated approximately 15 points versus the first half and retention within the existing customer base decreased by 2 points versus a year ago. We continue to expect the Small Business customer base and ARPC to grow in fiscal year 2020. The services offerings within QuickBooks Online have experienced an even greater impact. For example, after growing approximately 30% year-over-year through mid-March, payment charge volume was flat year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. Within our online payroll offering after an increase of 20% year-over-year and workers paid through mid-March, workers paid decreased 10% year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. Similarly, after the total number of companies running payroll grew 15% year-over-year through mid-March, the number of companies running payroll was approximately flat during the second half of the quarter. These trends could result in higher attrition and lower revenue in the future.  Despite limited visibility in near term, we are more inspired than ever to achieve our 2025 prosperity, reputation and growth goals. As a reminder, our prosperity goals are at a double household savings rate and improve the success rate of small businesses by 10 points better than benchmark for anyone on our platform. We will do so by becoming an AI-driven expert platform and doubling down on our five big bets. As we look into the future, we have resourced our big bets for acceleration. Let me share our progress on each of these bets.  Big bet number one is foundational to accelerate innovation across our platform. I'll come back to this one in a minute since it supports the other four big bets. Big bet number two is all about connecting people to experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence to do their own taxes and to manage our business. We're connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, allowing us to reach more customers, deepen engagement and grow ARPC. Within TurboTax Live this season, we've improved access to experts through real time chat and a floating live help button, contributing to improving customer conversion and retention.  On the expert side of the platform, we're using AI to improve the experience by automating repetitive tasks, and presenting experts with a contextual customer information, based on the location of the customer within the product experience. As a result, we've seen average session handle time decline nearly 20% this season, while at the same time providing a better experience for our customers. This season, we've earned the highest customer satisfaction scores for TurboTax Live ever. For QuickBooks Live, we're seeing promising early results. With the rapid shift to virtual solutions, we're seeing better-than-expected customer acquisition and we continue to experiment across the line-up. For example, we further refined the Set Up offering we introduced in January. We're seeing an encouraging number of customers who have used the Set Up offering to upgrade their monthly subscription, making us optimistic that's it's a great way to introduce customers to the benefits of QuickBooks Live. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions for customers by connecting them to financial tools and partners that help put more money in their pockets. In its third season, we're on track to nearly double active use for Turbo. This suggests customers are finding value from our recently introduced innovations like mobile refund tracking and weekly credit card -- credit score updates. And in this challenging environment, our pending acquisition of Credit Karma is more important than ever because we help consumers make better financial decisions. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers sell in an omni-channel world, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We recently launched Cash Flow Planner in QuickBooks Online. Managing cash flow is the biggest problem our customers face, one that is only magnified during this difficult period. Cash Flow Planner is an AI-powered interactive tool that looks at small businesses' financial history to predict future money in and money out events, enabling a small business customer to forecast its cash needs more accurately. Within payments, we're offering our payments customers free access to instant deposits to put more money in their hands even faster. Since this free offer became available, the volume of payments received instantly by our customers has more than doubled. This offering is in its early days.  Within payroll, we're enabling our small business customers to hold on to their money longer by using our money movement capabilities to pay employees next day. As a result, we've reduced the time between running payroll and paying employees by one-third, driving product recommendation scores up 10%. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the mid market with QuickBooks Online event, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid market customers, who are over-served by higher priced competitive offerings. We introduced several new features to help our customers individually tailor the product to their needs, including building their own dashboard and additional custom fields for expense transactions. We continue to work closely with partners to develop integrations that save our customers' time and improve their experience. Now more than ever, a cloud offering is needed by mid-market customers at a disruptive price.  Now let me wrap up our big bets by circling back to bet number one, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to deliver benefits to our customers instantly and to make the interactions with our offerings frictionless by accelerating the application of AI. Earlier, I shared several examples of how we're using AI to provide customers access to help through Intuit Aid Assist and PPP funds through QuickBooks Capital or how our customers are accessing funds with instant deposit, managing cash flow with Cash Flow Planner or how we're improving the experience for experts with AI. We are uniquely positioned to use AI to unlock the power of data and service to our customers, both the velocity and impact of our innovation. Now, let me share our thoughts on the bigger picture in the current environment. We expect this environment to act as an accelerant to the best we've declared. First, we expect to see an accelerating shift to our virtual world. This aligns with our big bet to connect people to experts using technology to improve competence. Second, the need for small businesses to increase their online presence and commerce will become more essential, and this aligns with our big bet to be the center of small business growth by providing tools and visibility for customers to better manage their cash flow.  Finally, as we've seen in previous times of hardship, we expect consumers to put a high premium on offerings that can improve their financial health, which aligns with our bets to help consumers unlock smart money decisions. This includes helping our customers with saving more money and getting out of debt and becoming a trusted financial assistant in their pocket with our pending acquisition of Credit Karma. Our strategy in big bets position us better than ever before. We have a proven playbook that focuses our investments on accelerated innovation and what matters most. In that context, we have aligned the company to invest in what's most important for future growth, while delivering against our financial principles. We intend to play offense during this downturn by investing in the largest opportunities for the future, our big bets. When we do our job well, we believe we will come out of this downturn stronger than ever before. To wrap up, I'm incredibly proud of our accomplishments this quarter. We remain focused on what matters most to our customers and those things that we can control during this time of uncertainty.  Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thanks, Michelle. We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact on the world during this time. I'm proud of the actions that we've taken as a company to support our customers when they need us most. We've acted with speed, enabled our employees to be safe and productive working from home and continuing to innovate for our customers. We're using our capabilities to rapidly deploy solutions to help consumers and small businesses access the products and relief that they need during this fiscal time. I'm confident we will emerge an even stronger company.  So, with that, let me turn it over to you Latif. Let me take it in maybe two ways. One, maybe mid longer term and then the other is the here and now. First of all, we have a playbook for times like this and our playbook is really about focusing on customers, focusing on innovation and putting our investment dollars in the areas that matter the most. But then, as you heard from Michelle, being very diligent in terms of our expense, envelope. With that said, as we look at the long-term, we're actually quite excited about the current environment, not the health element of it, but the fact that it will accelerate folks moving to a virtual world, folks moving to having more online presence and commerce capabilities and then money has always been important. But we believe more than ever, ways to save money and get out of debt is going to be more important than ever before and our big bets are squarely focused on the things that matter the most. And we happen by the way to be going through our one and two year planning process, which literally was happening in parallel of when the pandemic started. And it was at that time where we actually used the opportunity not only to be clear about a conservative investment envelope for our next fiscal year, but to really ensure that we can take the dollars that we have allocated and use them as an accelerant for our bets and we just finalized our one and three year plan internally and have allocated our dollars to the big bets and the ones that matter most, and in fact, again, using it as an opportunity to accelerate. So, we actually feel good about the things that we can control and the things that we need to do for our customers to come out of this even stronger.  With that said, and going to the very today here and now elements of your questions, part of our playbook is ensure that we really bend over backwards and do what's right for customers in this kind of an environment and beyond the innovations that you heard that we kind of turned on a dime to deliver like instant deposit for free, PPP, the free stimulus offerings that we referenced, brought to the marketplace. There are elements of things that we're doing for our customers such as we paused any price increases that we planned. We paused our full service payroll migration, which has significant benefits for customers and those that migrate to it at rave, but we didn't want to have our customers think about payroll migration in a time like this.  As we've communicated in the past, we have in essence launched in you line up in QuickBooks, one element of it being QuickBooks Advanced, which allows us to serve mid-market customers. That comes with very clear lines of number of users, number of invoices that you can pay, the number of transactions. And for now, we've actually paused that important line, where you have to migrate to QuickBooks Advanced, all of which at the right time we will put back in place. But we're being very diligent to do what's right for customers, and we're getting a lot of great feedback from customers, inclusive of some of the discounting that we put in place to acquire new customers in these very uncertain times. So those are just some of the examples of the things that we're doing. We have a proven playbook where really the team is actually getting quite well against it. It does not. We're actually more excited about what we can do with Credit Karma to accelerate helping customers, save money and reduce debt. So, it has not changed our plans. So, Mark, thanks for your question. First of all, I'll just remind us that, when you look at the categories that we serve, the DIY category is about $3 billion in TAM. The assisted category is about $20 billion in TAM. And then the consumer finance space, which we're going to be able to accelerate serving with Credit Karma is about $57 billion in TAM. In that context, very specifically to your question, this is actually the part of the season that is our strength. Really the revenue that shifted into the fourth quarter is because of the fact that the IRS deadline shifted, and these are actually the more high value customers, the more complex customers and the ones that have balance due, and it's actually are our strength. This part of the season is our strength, because it's our customers with the highest retention over the years. And so, given where we are with the category growth and given that we're the champions of do-it-yourself category with the category growth and what we see with share and ARPC, we feel good about where we are and we're excited about playing our game in the last two months of the season which is our strength. And we've really not seen anything outside of what we would expected from an FSA perspective. So, really the revenue shift is entirely because of the shift in the deadline. Yes, I'll make two comments. One is, I think this pandemic will drive structural and behavior changes across many industries, whether it's education, whether how you get mortgage loans, to how you manage your business, to how you do your taxes. And the great news is we're positioned the well with our digital platform to serve customers with assistance to really take advantage of the opportunity. And there's just simply a tailwind of more and more folks wanting to be able to do their taxes themselves and if they need help to be able to get that assistance in the comfort of their home. We'll have to see how the season plays out. I don't want to second guess whether these current trends will continue or not. But what I would tell you is that the shift to a virtual world probably accelerated by five years across many, many different industries. And I think that will be the same thing that we'll see play out when it comes to doing your taxes and/or helping small businesses manage their books, which is where QuickBooks Live comes into play. So, what I would say is -- Id just touch on the first couple of weeks in May. We have seen a stabilization. To be specific we've seen stabilization in charge volume, the number of payroll companies that are paying their employees. We've seen stabilization and the number of companies that are tracking their time through TSheets. We've been seeing the same thing with acquisition of new customers and we've seen stabilization on the retention front. And on desktop, we've seen a little bit of an uptick because we deliberately slowed down the communication upgrades to our desktop customers, because the timing of doing so was really right in line with when the pandemic hit. And so now that we've started that communication, there's been a little bit of an uptick. I think what's really important, if I put all of this in a context, is it's several weeks of trends. And we want to make sure that we don't portray several weeks of trends into a trend, but we have seen a stabilization in the first two weeks, but we clearly want to see the economy come back and ultimately see small businesses open up and see if that trend continues. Yes, sure, Robert. Thank you for your question. Let me make two points. One, when this pandemic hit beyond the fact that we were right in the middle of our two and one year of planning and it was a great opportunity for us to agree to a conservative investment envelope as we look ahead to really continue to build our muscle in terms of prioritization and resource allocation. We also then looked at that here and now and what changes we would make. And we did reduce discretionary funds in areas that we were very comfortable with. Of course travel is a given, but hiring and marketing across the board. And specifically in TurboTax both customer success and marketing, we of course needed to kind of lead time, which the team has done. We have a playbook around this and extended between now and July 15th. And so, we've done that. But I would say overall the company's discretionary spend are down because we lowered it for right reasons, but particularly in tax, we just simply extended it through the end of July. We expect, by the way, just sort of kind of black box that we'll need to spend up to $20 million in both customer success and marketing because of the extension of the tax season to ensure that we're there for our customers, but we've also reallocated dollars from other places in the company to make up for it. Yes, sure. Maybe if I could just ask Michelle to take that. Thank you for the question, Yao, and good to hear your voice, and hope all is well. Let me make a general comment, maybe two general comments and get more specific to your question. I think that first of all, as you know, us and Credit Karma are operating as two separate companies, but what I can tell you from the due diligence that we did, we were very impressed with their machine learning capabilities, their ability to do quality checks to watch for bias, and adjust their models on a daily basis because they use 2,600-plus data points per customer to run their models and so they are always adjusting. But let me, that's in context of the due diligence that we did, and I would just say the second macro point is this is one of the reasons why we believe that this environment is actually an accelerant for us to find ways to help customers put more money in their pockets, save money, and get out of debt because all of the machine learning capabilities that we have and Credit Karma has and that we have that in this current environment, done the right way, actually allows us to adjust our models to better serve customers. Now, let me get more specific I think to your question around QuickBooks Capital. This QuickBooks Capital and the machine learning capabilities and the platform is something that we've been working on for years both cleaning up the data so we can use 26 billion data sources and the 360 information that we have from our customers and with their permission to be able to use to in essence know what loans that they can be able to take on, what capacity, the number of months, and how quickly we can adjust our dial. And one of the things that the team has done that's a wonderful progress is that we do checks for biases. Whether in this environment or in a different environment, we're always checking for biases so we can adjust the model. And the model's built in such a way where we can adjust it on a daily basis so we can learn very, very quickly, and what we see in this environment is that it's actually a great opportunity to accelerate our learning so that we can be much more pinpoint in terms of what we can do for customers and when we can do it for the customers. So I'm proud of our QuickBooks Capital team and what they've been able to actually accomplish, and we're learning and adjusting more daily. And by the way, those capabilities is not just for QuickBooks Capital. We use those same capabilities for Instant Deposit, same-day payments, we use those same capabilities for same-day payroll, and so these capabilities are truly platform capabilities that we can use across the company. I'm sorry. Could you ask your question one more time? Yes, first of all, we truly admire what the team in Treasury and SBA has done to make these loans available and all of the checks they've had to do on privacy and security to be able to distribute these loans, so they truly deserve an applause for the work that they've done. To get to your question, we actually have been able to move quite fast and quite rapidly because of the fact that we know our customers' data, whether it's QuickBooks and payroll customers or QuickBooks Desktop payroll customers, or Self-Employed that have actually filed their taxes with us and be able to very quickly help them apply for the loan. Really, the biggest inhibitor has been all of these that are applying for the loan and having to wait in line to be able to get the loans approved by the SBA. And so, really that's where the bottleneck is. And by the way, the SBA is actually moving quite fast. It's just the number of loans that's coming out of loan requests and how they have to process it and ensure that they reduce fraud. That's I think probably the most difficult part. But on our end, we've been able to move very, very rapidly and we don't really have too many obstacles in front of us. Yes, thank you for your question. Again, great to hear your voice, and hope you're safe and sound. When you think about Intuit's base, we serve primarily service base businesses, and one of the core drivers behind our bet number four which is being the center of small business growth and one element of it being really providing transformative experiences to make it easy for our customers to do commerce across multiple channels is to actually be able to accelerate serving and penetrating product-based businesses. But it's interesting what this environment is causing, so now let me get to answer your question in two ways. One is even service-based businesses, they're actually if you remember at Investor Day we shared last year that we have 400 million-plus invoices that our customers send out, but about 12% are payment-enabled. We're actually seeing more and more service-based businesses that are actually looking to make all of their payments payment-enabled so they can actually get paid online faster and be able to get out of the paper world. And so this is having, this is going to over time have an impact on service-based businesses to get out of doing manual payroll and doing it online because they've seen with the Paycheck Protection Program if you can't prove your payroll data, you're not really -- you're not going to be able to be first in line to get a loan. And so, it's going to impact more and more service-based businesses going online which is where our sweet spot is. The second element though is the question you asked which is omni-channel, and really the core problem that we want to solve based on well over a year of conversations with our customers is it's actually quite easy for our customers to get set up on different channels, whether it's Instagram, Facebook, Etsy, Amazon, that's not their biggest issue. Their biggest issue is they lose sight of which customer is coming from which channel, which customer is profitable, are they getting paid on time across the different channels, how that connects to their inventory, because clearly, you don't want to run out of inventory and fulfillment is critical. And so the problem that we want to solve is really if I put it in simple terms, having an app where you can actually see all the orders that came in through all the different channels in one place. You can ultimately over time see the profitability of your payments. It connects to the profitability of your customers. You can see how it connects to your inventory that automatically tells you that you're going to have to fulfill your inventory. We're in the very early stages of solving that problem, but we're very clear on what the problem is and we believe this environment will not only over time help us penetrate service-based businesses but it will position us bet number four, to serve product-based businesses. So that's the way we see it and that's the way we think about it. Sure. Well first of all, I'll start by affirming it is a very unusual season because I don't think we've been in a place where tax season has been extended. But in many ways, it's affording us new opportunities because our team is built for times like this and things like experimenting in ways that we otherwise wouldn't be able to. So our team is doing a wonderful job leveraging the current opportunity. If you think about last year, there was 155 million returns filed and I think there's 110-ish-million that have been filed already, and the actual specific numbers are on the IRS website, but nevertheless, that would tell you that you've got 40 million, 45 million customers that still need to file their taxes between now and July 15. So that kind of gives you a feel for what's left to come. In terms of TurboTax Live, we focused this year on improving first-time use. We're really focused on providing more access to experts because when our customers engage an expert, our conversion and retention goes up and we're really focused on improving the expert side of the platform, meaning that experts would contextually know where the customer is, and how to best serve them and help them very, very quickly. And so far, TurboTax Live is really delivering within the expectations that we have had for it, and we've got two months of the most complex filers that are still left to come, and so we're excited to serve as many customers as we can between now and then through TurboTax Live. Yes, sure. Thanks for your question, and Kim and/or Michelle will keep me honest on this. Our goal was to serve as many small businesses as we could, and of course, we started with our existing base and I believe that all of the current customers that we served are all existing QuickBooks customers. So I'll get confirmation if I got that wrong, but it's been primarily all existing customers. And I would tell you to the second part of your question, it's incredible the halo effect that we've gotten by all the things that I mentioned earlier, from very quickly partnering with the IRS to launch the stimulus offerings, to what we've done with the PPP program, to what we've done to fund and partner with Go Fund Me, which is a crowd-sourcing platform to help small businesses get access to money, which I think has been almost close to $40 million that small businesses have gotten access to. Just a number of things that we've done has gotten really a lot of attention for QuickBooks as a brand that can help customers. And I think this current environment and what we have to do very specifically around PPP just really made our machine model, machine learning models stronger which allows us to make our services stronger which allows us to really over time, helps us better serve payments, payroll, and ultimately QuickBooks Capital customers. Sure, yes, absolutely. So what we have seen, more demand, less supply. And so on the demand side means that customers are really interested in their credit score, they're really interested setting goals for their credit score, and learning from us how to improve their credit score by potentially making payments on time or checking on the status of their refund, and of course, more interested in them getting access to whether it's personal loans, credit cards, those sorts of things. What we've seen an impact on is on the supply side, because in this kind of an environment, although the digital platform is the highest return for financial institutions, we've seen some financial institutions pull back temporarily off of the Turbo and Mint platform. But it's also the first place qualitatively that they told us they want to come back to. They're just waiting for the current environment specifically unemployment to stabilize so that they can then come back on to the platform. So higher demand, less supply from a financial institution side, which means less monetization. Sure, sure. Well, what I would start with and to build on your point, in '08-'09 time frame, what you in essence saw was in essence, the total number of small businesses that went out of business it upticked a couple of points. The number of businesses that started downticked a couple of points. So there was kind of a 3, 4 point impact on the total number of small businesses. And the second thing I would say is things are in some ways very different than '08 and '09 on two dimensions. One is, '08 and '09 was actually a recession caused by the health of financial institutions. This is a pandemic that's health-driven where in essence, small businesses have been completely shut down. The economy was actually quite healthy, but now it's not because of the shutdown of small businesses, which has also caused a recession. So in some ways, they're very different, but in many ways, the impact that we're seeing is the same, which is customer acquisition as I mentioned earlier has slowed down, retention has down-ticked a few points, charge volume has down-ticked from being up 30 to now it's been flat post-mid-March COVID impact. And so that's the impact of course that we're seeing now, but our business is also very different. We have larger portion of our Small Business is subscription-based and it's in the cloud whereas back then, it was primarily Desktop which sees a sharper decline but also a sharper rebound. So with all of that said, those are the two or three things that from a from/to perspective are different. I would reiterate what I mentioned earlier. We are not trying to second-guess the market or meaning how fast things will rebound or how long this is going to, this impact will stay in place. So we're very focused on our controllables, which is accelerating our focus on our big bets, helping our customers in times like this just to ensure we're positioned to come out of this much, much stronger than when we even went into it. Sure. We of course as I mentioned earlier, the numbers -- the stimulus numbers are actually in the current filings and we believe at some point the IRS will hopefully separate them so there's visibility for our investment community, what the actual tax returns are versus stimulus returns. 80% of folks have actually been eligible for the stimulus money. The point that we tried to be clear about earlier is that there are 10 million people that don't typically have to file their taxes that are also eligible, and so they have to go through the stimulus offering to be able to get access to the funds. And we believe at some point by then the tax season, the IRS will in essence flesh that out and communicate what the actual tax returns are versus stimulus filings. What you should be left with is it doesn't change the perspective that we shared about the business. The do-it-yourself category is growing. We're seeing a larger and faster shift to the category. We feel good about where we are relative to our online share and ARPC, and this is the part of the season that's our strength and we're looking forward to finishing the next couple of months out. Sure, sure. I'll start with what I think all of you see and then I'll make a specific to us, but as I talked a lot of my peers across many different industries whether it's CEOs of companies or investors in many, many companies across many industries, whether it's from how you used to get your workouts in and training, if you went to a trainer and how that is shifting to a virtual world, Peloton being one example of that where it's accelerating to an education world where now you have to figure out how to get your education online to more and more people now shifting to be able to engage for medical help online, so getting your taxes done, to being able to manage your business and bookkeeping, and so we believe that this pandemic will have a structural and behavioral impact in several areas. One is just you're going to first think about how to potentially engage in a virtual world, not in a physical world. It doesn't mean we won't go back to a physical world, but I think this will have a fundamental behavioral impact over time. Two is to ensure that you're doing most of your stuff online whether it's how you do payments, whether it's how you do payroll, whether it's how you conduct commerce, even if you're a service business, moving some of your things to now be able to conduct it online is going to be important. And then more important than ever, how do you ensure that you can save money and reduce debt? So we believe that structurally and behaviorally, those three areas are going to accelerate, and it's anybody's guess by how much. But literally, if you think about it overnight, these areas have shifted and I just think we've progressed five years in this area of moving to a virtual world the area of more being online, and the importance of money, and that's one of the things that excites our leadership team and the whole company around what is possible for us to accelerate to ensure that we can deliver for our customers given these shifts that we're seeing. Yes, thanks, Matt. Although our trends were all at the Small Business level, what I would just tell you is we've seen U.S. be a bit more resilient than countries outside of the U.S. and all those metrics that we shared. And then the second thing is on the Self-Employed side, what's interesting is although the macro numbers that we shared which is acquisition being down 15 points before and after, or after COVID, with some of the discounting that we are doing, we're actually seeing interest probably more than before on the Self-Employed side. That of course in no way covers the impact that we're seeing on acquisition, but we're actually seeing what we're looking to learn is are these new Self-Employed businesses being born and they're using our Self-Employed app, or maybe we're doing the analysis and looking at our data. But the bumper sticker is I would say U.S. is more resilient than countries outside the U.S., and we're seeing interesting acquisition trends on SE early days, we need to analyze it to understand where they're coming from. It doesn't change the bigger picture of what we shared, which is post-mid-March we were down 15 points and we've seen that stabilize, but SE is a little bit of a green shoot that we're looking to learn more about. Sure, Kash. Great to hear your voice, and hope you're doing well and safe and sound. Let me start with your last question first, and you're very right. It is sad to see this kind of an unemployment rate and we are all hopeful that at some point things will rebound and folks will be able to get back to work. I think what I would say is because unemployment rate was actually very low through March, and when you get unemployment income, we don't actually foresee an impact to tax next year because you still have to do your taxes because you were employed and you have unemployment income and so which means you have to do your taxes. So we actually do not see an impact from the number of people that will need to file IRS, when I look at the total number of IRS returns, this shouldn't have a dramatic impact for the reasons that I mentioned. The second is we are very focused on how we help serve these customers through our Live platform, and we believe that this could really be an impetus to deliver a great experience to deliver higher confidence and for you to be able to do it from the comfort of your home. So that's the answer to the question around unemployment. Headline news is folks are still going to have to do their taxes because unemployment rate was so low for the first several months of the year and you have to do your taxes because of unemployment income. The second in terms of indicators that we're looking at, I would say there are a few. One is just the number of workers and employees that are for instance tracking their time or are tracking their time through TSheets or getting paid through payroll or the number of payroll companies that are paying their employees. That is one very important indicator for us. The second is just what happens with charge volume. That is a very important indicator because it shows the strength of consumer spending with small businesses and small businesses and small business spending. So that's the second. And then third is the rate of acquisition and the rate of attrition. Those are all the trends that we look at. And I would just highlight one subset of all of this which is how QuickBooks Live performs in this environment. It's less about just QuickBooks Live but the notion of getting help. Although very early days with QuickBooks Live, we've been happy with the as we said earlier, with the acquisition trend that we've seen because more and more folks are not only looking to do things in a virtual world but are actually looking in this time frame to get help to clean up their books to ensure they're compliant and to become far more effective and efficient in how they run their business because again, money matters more than ever before. So those are the three, four indicators that we are looking at, and doubling down on the bets that I mentioned earlier because we believe just there's a huge opportunity to help customers shift to online to help customers shift to a virtual world and to be able to find more ways to put money in their pocket. Yes, I will. First of all, thank you for everyone's time and for joining today and your thoughtful questions. I would like to just close by once again, thanking our employees for just the incredible work that they've done being by the side of our customers and being empathetic and compassionate for what they've having to go through and also just the partnerships with our partners. I wish all of you on the call well. Please stay healthy. Take care of yourself, and we look forward to talking to you at the next earnings call. Take care, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. We are also joined by Ken Lin, Founder and CEO of Credit Karma. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after the call ends. And with that, I will turn it call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us. We posted strong results for the first half of fiscal year 2020. I am also excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to acquire Credit Karma, a pioneer in the financial technology sector, for approximately $7.1 billion. I could not be more enthusiastic about this transformational transaction and I am thrilled to welcome the talented Credit Karma team. Ken Lin, the Founder and CEO of Credit Karma is with us today to talk about our shared excitement and commitment to one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money. We posted a slide deck on our website containing an overview of the agreement which provides more details. Let me start with a quick recap of the quarter. We are halfway through fiscal year 2020 and continue to see strong momentum across the company as we make progress on our strategy to become an AI-driven expert platform. Second quarter revenue grew 13% overall fueled by 17% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 8% growth in the Consumer Group. Revenue for the Strategic Partner Group grew 8%. With this strong performance, we remain on track to deliver our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. Let me remind you of the customer problems that we are addressing. All of our customers are consumers and have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and payoff debt and those who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. To solve our customers\u2019 most pressing problems, we remain focused on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. We are working to achieve this strategy by pursuing five big bets. These include revolutionize speed to benefit, so our customers fall in love with the product instantly; connect people to experts to improve confidence; unlock smart money decisions to put more money back in our customers\u2019 pockets; become the center of small business growth by fueling our customers\u2019 growth; and disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. Throughout the call, I will update you on where we stand on these bets. With that context, let me start with tax. We are confident in our strategy and are on track to deliver and achieve our full year guidance. As a reminder, there are four key drivers of our consumer tax business. The first is total number of returns that is filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using DIY software. The third is our share within the DIY software category. And the fourth is the average revenue per return. Based on the latest IRS data and the DIY software category is performing better than assisted as it has for more than a decade. As the category leader, we view it as our responsibility to help drive category awareness and growth. So we are pleased with this result. Through February 7, IRS data shows total e-filed returns are up 0.6%, with self-prepared e-files up 3.5% and assisted e-files down 3.7%. Based on what we are seeing, our share within the DIY category is up year-over-year. We are growing the category and growing our share, which is right where we want to be. Our strategy for the Consumer Group is to expand our lead in the DIY category, transform the assisted tax preparation category and disrupt consumer finance. This is all in service of helping our customers make ends meet and get the largest tax refund. Let me share a few examples of how we are delivering for our customers this season. Within the DIY category, which is $3 billion in TAM, we are delivering enhancements to our premier offering to better serve customers with investments. We are driving faster growth in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx and Self-Employed. We are also expanding free eligibility to include all enlisted active duty military and reservists and providing historical tax return access for all customers. In the assisted category, which is $20 billion in TAM, we continue to make progress with our second big bet to connect people to experts with TurboTax Live. We are working to further increase customer confidence on our platform by enhancing first time use. This season, we improved accessibility back to experts by offering customers the option to connect with an expert when they first sign-in to TurboTax Live to address top of mind questions. We also introduced real-time chat and a floating Live Help button to make it easier to connect with live help at all stages of the return process. We continue to accelerate the application of AI to create tools for experts to automate repetitive tasks, increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience. Beyond tax, we continue to make progress disrupting consumer finance, which represents $29 billion in TAM. This aligns with our third big bet to unlock smart money decisions. Through our Turbo offering, we are addressing key customer problems like managing debt, saving money and improving financial health overall. We are building on last season\u2019s success by expanding the financial marketplace. We are now live with pre-qualification partners offering both credit cards and personal loans to help customers save money and to provide partners with more qualified leads. Nearly 25% of our weekly active users have set a credit score, savings or debt-related goal in Turbo and we expect this to drive higher engagement over time. Acquiring Credit Karma expands our TAM from $29 billion to $57 billion accelerating our time to market moving beyond tax while also developing new ways to monetize our offerings. Now, turning to small business, we delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%, exceeding our target to grow more than 30%. We continue to solve key customer pain points as we execute on our big bets. We remain encouraged with our early results with QuickBooks Live, part of our second big bet to connect people to experts, opening access to a $10 billion bookkeeping opportunity. QuickBooks Live solves one of the customers\u2019 biggest needs confidence and peace of mind, while helping experts grow their business and find new customers. We are now also offering setup help, providing customers with confidence from the moment they subscribe. We are working to achieve our vision of being the center of small business growth, our fourth big bet, by helping our customers get paid faster, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We introduced a new payroll lineup featuring full service across all offerings as well as TSheets integration for time tracking that\u2019s resulting in customers adopting TSheets at 3x the rate they did prior to launching the integrated offering and a tax penalty free guaranteed for select offerings. We also introduced a feature that double checks customers\u2019 over time calculations, reducing the likelihood of fines and penalties. We continue to make progress on our fifth big bet, disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings. Approximately 75% of our current QBO Advanced customers have traded up from our existing QBO product, unlocking benefits such as faster invoicing with batch import tools, automation, more customized fields and user permissions. Now, I want to address the news we announced today to acquire Credit Karma. I have long been an admirer of the company that Ken and his team have built. As we have gotten to know each other, Ken and I realized we both share one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money. This combination fits directly with Intuit\u2019s mission and long-term strategy. Our mission is to power prosperity around the world. And our bold goal for 2025 is to double the household savings rate for customers on our platform. This acquisition is a giant step forward in achieving that goal and significantly accelerates execution of our big bet to unlock smart money decisions. This big bet is aimed at helping consumers address the personal finance problems they face today helping them reduce debt, maximize savings and put more money in their pockets. Today, many consumers struggle with not knowing or fully understanding where they stand with their finances and they struggle to make ends meet. Household debt in the United States hit $14.1 trillion. 23 million consumers relied on at least one payday loan in 2018 to get faster access to cash. If consumers just had the tools to better understand their financial health and opportunities to improve it, they could unlock billions of dollars of potential savings. For example, understanding the difference and availability of lower cost personal loans versus high cost credit cards could save consumers $20 billion to 40 billion. And Credit Karma estimates that 80% of Americans overpay on car loans to the tune of $37 billion as there is no easy way to compare offerings. Consumers want to do better and 60% say they are trying to improve their credit score, but they need help. We aspire to do more and Credit Karma is the perfect partner to help us do this. Credit Karma shares our goal of making it simple for consumers to make better decisions with their money through a platform that works like a personalized financial assistant, helping consumers find the right financial products, putting more money in their pockets and providing them with insights and advice. This platform will provide consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information, including their income, spending and credit history to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining better interest rates. The result will be a complete financial profile that puts the power in consumers\u2019 hands so they can take the steps necessary to improve their financial health. Let me tell you what this will look like. To find the right financial products, we will match consumers with pre-approved offers on personal loans, home loans, credit cards and insurance. We will put more money in their pockets by connecting them to higher yield savings accounts and faster access to their hard earned paycheck. We will also provide insights and connect them to experts to help consumers make better decisions about their money and improve their credit score. All of this will be done by leveraging artificial intelligence and connecting consumers to over 100 financial partners on the platform solving a two-sided problem. This consumer finance platform offers compelling value for our financial institution partners as we provide efficient access to a broad set of qualified customers. While consumers strive to be more informed about their finances and want personalized offers from a trusted source, financial institutions want high-quality leads and face real challenges matching their products to the right customers. We can help them target their offers based on metrics like verified income and credit history giving them the ability to reach qualified prospects. Ken will get into this shortly, but Credit Karma\u2019s history is remarkable. The Credit Karma platform has attracted more than 100 million members, with 88% engagement via mobile among active users and over one-third of which are active on the platform each month. The platform has a net promoter score of 69. The company recorded revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, growing 20% year-over-year. Impressively, over 90% of Credit Karma\u2019s annual revenue results from existing members returning to the platform. Together, we can deliver unprecedented benefits to customers, combining the benefits of scale, trust and data. Let me turn it over to Ken, Credit Karma\u2019s founder and CEO, to share his perspective on the transaction. \nKen Lin: Thanks, Sasan. I\u2019m incredibly excited about today\u2019s announcement. As Sasan mentioned through many conversations we have found a real shared goal for changing personal finance for the better of consumers. When we started the company in 2007, we had a fundamental belief that consumers are being left behind in financial services innovation. We started the company with a mission to Champion Financial Progress for All with the intention of leveling the playing field for all consumers. In 2008, we launched the Credit Karma platform by providing consumers completely free credit scores. Now, 12 years later we have provided more than four billion credit scores and created a platform with over 100 million members, over a third of which are active on the site every month. Notably, we are helping a new generation better manage their finances, as more than half of our members are under the age of 44. We use the term members because our users are unique, have verified information from a third party and begin an engagement loop with our products. When we started the business we saw consumers lost in a sea of complexity and the opportunity for technology to make a difference. Today, we are leaders and our business model is quite simple: we help consumers find the right product for them based on their credit and financial profile with their consent. Intuit enables us to strengthen this ability by allowing customers to add income data to that profile, enable members to see more offers through which they qualify. Then, we simplify the application process, we help members significantly increase their probability of approval, and we help members transparently compare rates and features. We do this for credit cards, personal loans, auto lending, mortgages, high yield savings accounts, auto insurance, home insurance and other verticals to come. So this opportunity is also meaningful and exciting for all our trusted partners, to believe that and support us throughout our history. These personalized recommendations are embedded by technology, and 8 billion daily model predictions. Perhaps what I am most excited about is the real impact we\u2019ve had on consumers' lives. As one example, we have seen meaningful increases in credit scores from members who regularly engage on our platform overtime. There are many reasons why it makes sense to join forces with Intuit right now. First and foremost, we have the ability to collaborate and bring technology solutions to solve real consumer problems. We see a platform which provides consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information - including their income, spending and credit history - to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining a better interest rate. Our insights will significantly accelerate Credit Karma\u2019s mission and we will then make a larger impact on our customers more quickly than either of us are able to alone. With millions of customers, more financial partners, and more resourcing, I am convinced we will be able to build a more valuable business that enables us to achieve our combined goals. I also have to say that the culture and team Sasan has put in place are critical factors in our decision to join together. We got inspired by Intuit\u2019s mission to power prosperity around the world and our team is ready to join Intuit on that journey. To each of my 1,300 Credit Karma colleagues, Karmanauts, thank you. I am deeply proud of the company we have built and the culture we have created. We worked long and hard to get to a day like this, yet as I have always said -- this is one step in our journey together. Our mission to champion our members\u2019 financial progress remains the same. Now, with our partner with Intuit, we will have the resources and capabilities to achieve our goals in a remarkable, significant and impactful way. I\u2019ll pass it back to you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Awesome. Thanks, Ken. I\u2019d like to add that while we see a lot of innovation and investment, in the marketplace we don\u2019t see anyone with our collective capabilities pursuing a personalized financial assistant. This is why we believe this combination can transform FinTech and power the economy. We have the ability to bring together consumers and financial institutions in innovative ways that lowers costs for all those involved and levels the playing field for consumers of all economic status. After the transaction closes, Ken will report to me, and continue to lead the Credit Karma team from its headquarters in San Francisco. Credit Karma will continue to operate under its current brand. Michelle will share the financial details of the transaction in a few minutes. To wrap up, we are pleased with the continued momentum of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group. We remain laser focused delivering for our customers during tax season and I could not be more excited about the Credit Karma acquisition and the opportunity it provides us to power prosperity for our customers. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start by providing an overview of financial results in the quarter, and then share more details on the proposed acquisition of Credit Karma we announced today. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of $270 million, a 16% increase, non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, a 13% increase, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, versus $0.72 a year ago, a 26% increase and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16, up from $1.00 last year, a 16% increase. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $499 million, up 8% for the second quarter. As we enter our third year of TurboTax Live, our technology-first approach continues to give us confidence we can expand our live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer term. As Sasan shared earlier, we are now using AI to automate repetitive tasks for experts on our platform, which we expect to increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience. Based on data published by the IRS, the broader tax season got off to a slow start through January, when total e-filed returns were down 0.7%. We remain confident in our plans and guidance for the year. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 8% in the second quarter, reflecting delivery of more forms during the second quarter as compared to the same period last year. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 17% during the second quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 43% in fiscal Q2 driven mainly by strong customer growth and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift. Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem; Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 23% in fiscal Q2. Within QuickBooks Online payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds from a mix shift to our full service offering. Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue again grew over 60%. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations, as QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter. Let me now spend a minute on the Credit Karma acquisition that Sasan and Ken described earlier. Intuit has agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $7.1 billion to acquire Credit Karma, comprised of half cash and half stock. The total consideration is subject to customary adjustments and includes an estimated $1 billion of equity awards that will be expensed over a period of up to three years. We will also deliver approximately $300 million of retention equity through restricted stock awarded to Credit Karma employees that will be expensed over four years. We plan to finance the cash portion of the transaction through cash and our existing unsecured line of credit. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of calendar year 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. We do not foresee an impact to maintaining our dividend and share repurchase principles due to the Credit Karma transaction. We expect the transaction to be neutral to accretive to Intuit\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes. We will provide updated Intuit guidance once the transaction is closed. Now, turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. Our financial principles in total have not changed and remain a durable framework for us. We finished the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $139 million of stock in the second quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable April 20th, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our Q3 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.53 to $5.58, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.90 to $5.95. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q3 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. I would like to thank our employees, our customers and partners for another strong quarter. I am excited about joining forces with Credit Karma and the transformative experience we can offer customers together. We will share more about our progress in the coming months. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions to hear what\u2019s on your mind.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much and thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the deal today, certainly, a company that we have been an admirer for a long time as well. But Sasan, if I can ask, Intuit\u2019s history includes some of the best acquisitions of all time in software and some deals that maybe were a bit less than great and with Credit Karma now the largest in the company\u2019s history, I only have two questions, why is this the right time for Credit Karma and the push into consumer finance just given the heightened awareness on data privacy and where we are in the consumer credit cycle and two, what\u2019s the approach with this asset that will be different this time?\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Hey, Brad. Thank you for your question. We are equally admirers of Credit Karma. A couple of things, I would say. Let me start with your question as to why now? This is very core to what we have declared around helping our customers make ends meet. It\u2019s very core to the strategy that we\u2019ve declared, which is about an AI driven expert platform and what we declared is that because everyone that we serve are consumers, we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions and together with Credit Karma there are things that we can do to benefit consumers that we believe are significant. First and foremost, consumers are in significant debt. They over pay on fees whether it\u2019s credit cards, whether it\u2019s home loans, auto loans whether it\u2019s insurance. They don\u2019t have access to advice in terms what are the things that they need to do to improve their credit score and their credit rating which matters a lot, so when it comes to the interest that they pay and also just the other side of it, which is how do they save money and how do they ultimately grow that money and in order to really be able to deliver against that, what we bring together with Credit Karma is scale and capability, it\u2019s scale of customers and scale of customers\u2019 data and it\u2019s the capability that we have and so ultimately now, customers are going to be able to leverage their own data, their income data, their spending data, their credit history, their life situations. I mean, together with Credit Karma, the customers will have access to all their information in one place and then we\u2019ll be able to match them with financial products that are right for them. We\u2019ll be able to connect them to savings accounts. We\u2019ll be able to help them get early access to their pay check and we will be able to provide insights and advice so they can actually continue to improve their financial habit. So in terms of why is this the right time. It\u2019s absolutely core to what we\u2019ve declared, its core to the goals that we\u2019ve set, and we believe that together we can truly do things that benefit consumers and benefit financial institutions because we will provide them also more choice. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s the right time. I think in terms of acquisitions, I would just say that the last several that we\u2019ve made have been extremely successful and we\u2019ve actually held them up as role models internally and we\u2019ve recently talked to our board about it. TSheets [indiscernible] just two of the latest three and the reason is we\u2019ve studied our history and we\u2019ve learned what works and what doesn\u2019t work and the clarity that we have around three things that matter, one is the mission and purpose \u2013 the alignment that we have with Ken and the team; two, the absolute alignments that we have on priorities; and third, and I would say equally as important is Ken is in charge. Our goal is to fuel his success and Credit Karma\u2019s success and just how we\u2019ve organized around the work is essential to the success. So across the board, we have a lot of confidence and are very clear about how to manage the risks.\nBrad Zelnick: Sasan thank you so much for the very thoughtful answer. If I could just sneak in one for Ken, Ken, can you talk about the concept of autonomous finance and why being on Intuit\u2019s platform can help to accelerate that vision? Thank you.\nKen Lin: Yes, absolutely. So thanks for the question. So autonomous finance right is really our ability to help consumers automate their financial life in a way that reduces friction, increases uncertainty, and creates more transparency and efficiency. So if you look at the problems that exist today, most consumers don\u2019t know which are the right products for them, they don\u2019t know how to apply for those products and there\u2019s so much friction to making it happen. So for us, our platform is really predicated on integrating with financial institutions so that you can make it easy, moving the dollars or automating the process itself, so it does not require as much work and therefore friction and then lastly, adding a layer of education to consumers to understand what is absolutely best for them and if you do that, we fundamentally believe we can level the playing field for the most disadvantaged and most vulnerable consumers and assist them.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks so much. Congrats.\nKen Lin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys and thank you for taking the question. A question on the sort of the overlap within the product lines between Credit Karma and in the TurboTax line. How should we think about that on a going forward basis? Credit Karma does tax and has a pre-tax offering obviously TurboTax does a lot of tax. I always thought of Turbo as a competing solution to sort of the core Credit Karma solution in terms of giving people more visibility into their financial health and giving offers. So Credit Karma is going to be a stand-alone. It\u2019s going to exist as a separate brand, is it going to be competing offerings under the same umbrella of Intuit or how should we think about that product overlap on a go-forward basis?\nSasan Goodarzi: Got it. Great. Thank you, Keith for the question. Let me just start with tax, our intent is to keep the free tax software within Credit Karma because we believe in what they are doing and the fact that customers should have choice and we are not doing this deal because of tax. They have 106 million customers and really we are doing this because we believe that we can truly create a consumer finance platform that can serve as a financial assistant to really power the prosperity of customers. So that is really the strategic rationale and reason for the deal and we will continue to offer taxes for free through Credit Karma and through TurboTax and we\u2019re very confident in that go-forward approach. In terms of Mint and Turbo, I think I would go back to what I shared a moment ago with Brad. We are very focused on helping customers make ends meet and we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions for our customers and ultimately, this is really about speed the market. This is really about bringing the capabilities of the two companies together, the scale of the customers\u2019 data and capabilities to be able to move much faster to help these customers that are really underserved, struggling and are looking for help and that\u2019s really the rationale for why we are doing this and specifically around Mint and Turbo, our game plan over time is actually to combine that into one app and we want to focus entirely on Credit Karma\u2019s growth and we don\u2019t actually want to distract Credit Karma at all with the fact that there is Turbo and there is Credit Karma. The reality is customers have choice and they\u2019ll be able to pick the product that\u2019s right for them. Sorry, go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: So just to be clear, will the Mint and Turbo apps, will those consolidate into one app with Credit Karma or is there going to be a separate Mint Turbo app and a separate Credit Karma app.\nSasan Goodarzi: No, no, they will be \u2013 ultimately, they will be separate. They will not be combined into one app only because I think our focus is we have a huge opportunity to ensure that we can fuel Credit Karma\u2019s growth and we don\u2019t want to have any distractions other than ensuring that they can deliver for customers, so they will be separate apps.\nKeith Weiss: Okay, that\u2019s clear.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes and Keith, just a note on Credit Karma, I think from our perspective, we\u2019re neither a credit score company nor are we a tax company. We focus on solving consumer problems. So for us, our members who are coming to us asking for credit scores are really asking for how can they borrow at the best rates possible and on the opposite side of that when consumers are coming to us from our tax product, it\u2019s really about getting their dollars back from the government and sort of doing the necessities. So we think of that not as a product per se, but really the problems or the challenges that we\u2019re solving on behalf of our members.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And if I could throw in one follow-up for Michelle. To get to a neutral to accretive situation with Credit Karma, is there any synergies you are assuming on that either on the revenue side or the expense side of the equation or is it just the profitability of Credit Karma today can get you there on an accretion basis.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: When we look at Credit Karma, they really bring a big track record of success with the beyond user paid business models. They have revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, which was growing at 20%. They\u2019ve reached scale with high engagement, robust marketplace. We are really not able to share any of the profitability information at this point in time, but we do feel good about their platform model and the company\u2019s commitment to really serving and engaging their members. And then as we stated, we do believe that we will be in a neutral to accretive our position in our non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Alright, thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRobert Simmons: Hi, this is Robert Simmons on for Alex. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about the results so far in season for Live, surely it won\u2019t triple again this year, but how is it tracking?\nSasan Goodarzi: We are actually very pleased with the progress and the results that we\u2019re making. I mean, first, I would start by saying, as the category leaders, our focus is to grow the category, which we feel like we\u2019ve had a large part in doing so given what the stats I shared earlier that the do-it-yourself category is growing faster than assisted and we have been able to increase our share and a driver of us being able to increase our share is the continued traction and growth with TurboTax Live and we are very pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s in line with what we would expect through this early part of the season and I think I would just remind that we are so early in our journey of going after this $20 billion market of transforming the assisted marketplace that we expect continued accelerated growth from TurboTax Live given that it is a seamless platform for customers to use at the ease of their home or office and they can get access to expertise at anytime they wish throughout the experience. So we are just at the beginning of the journey of what\u2019s possible with TurboTax Live.\nRobert Simmons: Got it. Great, thanks. And then, have you noticed any competitive change from others doing similar things such as H&R Block?\nSasan Goodarzi: I can\u2019t comment on H&R Block other than I really love what we\u2019re seeing in our results, we are growing the category, we\u2019re taking share and we are seeing the growth that we would have expected in TurboTax Live and continuing to benefit from our focus around the first time use, more access points for experts, and making the expert platform easier that gives us the opportunity to ensure efficiency and expanding margins over time. So we \u2013 and by the way, we also have experienced that more folks that enter the category, the more we\u2019re actually able to accelerate the growth in the category. So far, what we are seeing is exactly what we would have expected.\nRobert Simmons: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you. This is a John [ph] for Brent Thill. Congrats on the deal again. I just wanted to add another question on that and that was the first question, but I think some of the questions that we\u2019re getting, is this a signal at all of maybe anything in your core business slowing, is there any slowdown or does this really just open up an adjacent market with a lot of new opportunities for you?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, this is about acceleration. The way you should think about this is we get to expand our TAM, we are acquiring a business that has incredible capabilities of $1 billion growing 20% plus with a platform model that has the ability to grow operating margins over time and frankly, more importantly, all of that is possible because we are able to do things for consumers and provide them more choice and more benefits and do the same for financial institutions. I would look at this as, it\u2019s squarely focused on one of our five best that we declared and it\u2019s all about acceleration while we continue to see acceleration really connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live, and some of what we\u2019re doing on the small business front. So this is about acceleration.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your question please.\nKen Wong: Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe first back to the Credit Karma\u2019s transaction, I think we all understand what great brands both TurboTax and Credit Karma and we see maybe the long-term synergies on the consumer side. Just wondering is there any benefit to or from your small business division that we might be missing in terms of how it might interplay with this transaction here?\nSasan Goodarzi: Let me start and I\u2019ll have Ken add. One of the things that we\u2019ve been very intentional and working with Ken and the team on is alignment on purpose and vision, alignment on priorities, and ensuring that Ken is in charge and has what he needs to be able to deliver for customers and accelerate Credit Karma\u2019s growth and so we believe that there is an opportunity serving small businesses, but ultimately over time, Ken will decide when is that right time because ultimately we want to \u2013 there is so much opportunity ahead of us, but let me let Ken jump into that because I know he\u2019s been thinking about small businesses for some time.\nKen Lin: Thanks, well, if you think about what Credit Karma does from a business model perspective, it\u2019s again providing consumers with the certainty of finding the right products at a great rate and some of the best rates in the market. That same problem exists for small business users and historically for Credit Karma is how it\u2019s been challenging to determine who are small business owners, I think that\u2019s an opportunity for us to work together in the sense that we are now able to solve that problem for not just consumers, but small business owners as well. So we think that\u2019s a big upside in the future.\nKen Wong: Got it. Great. And then maybe a follow-up just on, you did go through some of the tax dynamics this year, but on that fourth driver, ARPU, you guys didn\u2019t really run into that too much. Just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of what you might be seeing on the ARPU side especially it seems like your early marketing has less of a focus on free versus last year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Well, as you know, when we talked about our long-term expectations and in essence shared that it\u2019s between 8% to 12%, one of the larger drivers of that was ARPU simply from the standpoint that we are focused on transforming assisted with our platform and there is just an opportunity to increase our ARPU. We\u2019ll share after season how that\u2019s performing, but I would tell you everything that we see so far in early season \u2013 there\u2019s results that you see because there is three days to four days of IRS opening, which is very a small portion of the results and there is what we see you through year-to-date and season to date and it\u2019s really in line with what we had assumed and again, we like what we see.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much and I\u2019ll echo the congrats on the acquisition. Maybe starting there Sasan, I think it makes tons of sense in terms of the strategic vision and why you also want to leave Credit Karma on its own to continue its growth. However, on the back end of the businesses, there is obviously a lot of potential synergies in terms of the data you\u2019re both collecting, the ability to apply AI to that to drive greater synergies for both. So how are you thinking about sort of the independence factor versus some of the maybe combined benefits of bringing the businesses together from a data perspective?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Thank you, Kirk for your question. Let me kick this off and I\u2019ll let Ken chime in because the business plan that\u2019s been developed has been jointly developed that will be executed after close. First of all, as I mentioned, there is alignment around mission and purpose and we\u2019ve also aligned around priorities. The priorities that we have aligned around is grow the core, it\u2019s expand growth verticals and it\u2019s developing emerging verticals and specifically, grow the core is really about growing credit cards and personal loans. Expanding growth verticals is about auto and home loans and insurance and then developing emerging vertical is really about providing offerings like savings, checking and then over time early access to your paycheck, etcetera . So those are the three priorities that we have agreed to. Now, what\u2019s wonderful on behalf of consumers are the capabilities that we can bring together and so the first is creating a financial identity for the consumer. What that means is the consumer now based on the data that we have the 50 million customers and 106 million customers that Credit Karma has, the consumer now has access to their data in one place, their income data, their spending data, their credit history data, their life situation. I mean, Credit Karma has 2,600 data points for each of their customers on average and so creating a financial identity for the customer so they can use their data for their benefit is one thing that we will do together. The second is making our money movement capabilities, the services available for Ken and the team. That\u2019s all of our risk and fraud capabilities that we use for same-day payroll, same day payments, all of that is necessary for Ken over time to be able to provide early access to consumers\u2019 paychecks as an example. And then last but not least, we will make our financial data platform capabilities and services available to Ken so he can deliver benefits to customers and this is where we have 20,000 partners in our financial data platform where, again, all of this will be used with the customers consent and to their benefit. So when I talk about allowing Ken to be in charge and running Credit Karma, we will make those data elements and services with the customers consent available on the back end so that ultimately Ken can deliver more benefit for Credit Karma customers over time and that\u2019s where we see the acceleration and we don\u2019t want to distract Ken and Credit Karma with anything else other than what\u2019s most important to deliver for customers. So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking.\nKen Lin: Yes. And maybe just to give you a little color on how you actually turn that into product when Sasan talked about income and the financial identity. One of the things that we observe in the space is that credit is a great predictor of underwriting about 80% of the time. Income and assets is the other piece and as you may know, 81% of consumers \u2013 sub-prime consumers are declined for credit card offers. So if we actually have the full picture and the full financial identity of that consumer, we are able to provide them certainty in the space and again going back to this note of the most vulnerable people, when you apply for a credit product and you are declined, your score goes down and you get into this vicious cycle of getting into predatory lending of products that aren\u2019t good for you. To Sasan\u2019s note around the data platform, with it, we\u2019ll be able to do things like automation of our cash flow. We\u2019ll be able to audit \u2013 autonomous finance for us as moving money in such a way that you can minimize the interest that you\u2019re paying. You can move in a way that your credit score and your outstanding balances are at lowest so you can actually get those other products to help you get through life and then when it comes to you to access to the other data points, I think things like improving savings where you know approximately half the country don\u2019t have $400 in savings. We can help improve that savings rates with our ability to foster money movement.\nKirk Materne: That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for the answers and congrats on the quarter.\nKen Lin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your question please.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Sorry for my overhead noise here. The acquisition feels a little bit \u2013 it has a bit of a similarly to Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn where Microsoft bought a network and so you guys are buying effectively a network and Sasan and team, I\u2019m just curious to get your thoughts on how we should think about the TAM \u2013 so the Intuit TAM has been a very simple one, TurboTax units multiplied by ASP, you add value, etcetera same thing with QuickBooks and this is a very different monetization model. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on how the monetization model I mean conceptually, I get the story, but from a long-term standpoint of building a multi-billion dollar business, how do we think about the monetization from a dollars and cents perspective. I\u2019m curious what synergies can Intuit bring to Credit Karma that Credit Karma could not do for itself? Thank you so much and congratulations again.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Kash. Let me hit on a couple of these and then I\u2019m going to ask actually Ken to jump in and just share more around the business model. First of all, this is really one view of having a network effect. It\u2019s truly solves a two-sided problem. The more consumers consent with their data being used at more financial institutions and others participate on the platform, the stronger the platform gets to deliver for the end consumer, the more choice that it provides and so from a network effect perspective, this has some of those characteristics. In terms of synergy, it\u2019s really what we were just describing earlier, really what you are now able to bring together with the two companies is the customers\u2019 entire financial identity where they can use their data to get access to the best personal loans that are right for them, the best credit cards that are right for them, the best by the way, insurance, it could be home insurance, auto insurance, renters insurance because when the customer doesn\u2019t have all their data in one place, they in essence have experiences that Ken was just talking about earlier where they may get something where they are pre-approved for, but when they actually try to go through the process, 80% of them get rejected and now by the data being in one place, it actually accelerates us delivering the benefits and that\u2019s where the real synergy comes into places where we can do things together that we couldn\u2019t do apart. In terms of ASP, maybe let me let Ken just talk about the business model and how it works because that will be really the key characteristics moving forward.\nKen Lin: Yes, first, maybe let me frame the problem in the industry. So banks spend tens of billions of dollars each and every year marketing their financial services products and the challenge in the space is that each of those banks have a specific credit profile that they are looking for along with an ability to pay around income. Now imagine a bank that spends $100 million a year in marketing, maybe only 20% of those dollars are efficient because the other 80% go to people who are simply not qualified for that particular product. What we are able to do and speaking to this note around financial identity, we are able to help banks find those exactly right customers and I think that\u2019s the problem that we solve for our financial services partners. For the consumer, what they see is a landscape full of teaser rates, i.e., rates that are for extremely well qualified buyers. You actually can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re an extremely well qualified buyer because the banks use hundreds of different variables to determine your eligibility and what we\u2019re able to do is solve that particular problem for the consumer. So for our banking partners, they have access to a large scale of users that are highly qualified, for our members, we\u2019re able to provide a service that gives them certainty and transparency of all the offers in the market and as a business model, what we do is we charge a success fee for when we\u2019re able to match a consumer with the right financial services product and that is our business model and looking to capture all of those dollars that are being spent in digital and offline marketing today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJosh Beck: Thank you for taking the question. One of the things that the release stood out to me in the Credit Karma deck was the engagement and four times per month I think is quite strong. I imagine TurboTax has good engagement, but it tends to be more seasonal. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about how you\u2019ve gotten to those levels if it\u2019s expanding verticals or finding more relevant offers and then the second part of my question is really tied to the competitive set with Credit Karma. When I think about some of the longer-term items that Sasan mentioned, I\u2019m just wondering, is it changing in that you\u2019re competing maybe with a different audience than you used to. So would love to get some color on that?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, great. Thank you for your question. Let me kick it off and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ken to talk about all the incredible work they have done that drives all the engagement and then some of the new verticals that Ken described we\u2019re going into. I think to your first part of your question, from a strategic perspective, in context of going after the pain point of making ends meet, this really for the consumer front for the most part shifts us from engaging very infrequently and maybe once or twice a year to now engaging customers year round and delivering significant benefit and as we talked about earlier, you got 106 million members, 37 million that are monthly active and those that are monthly active, they engage four times a year and the excitement that we have around benefits that we can deliver and what\u2019s possible in the long-term is the more offerings that we can provide truly becoming this financial assisted in the pocket of our customers where they can get access to credit cards at the best rates that are right for them, personal loans, home loans, auto loans, insurance whether it\u2019s renters insurance or home insurance, savings accounts, early access to their paychecks that drives real benefit, real engagement and higher engagement over time, but what\u2019s remarkable about the company, Ken and the team have created is it\u2019s just at massive scale already. Now with that said, maybe Ken you can jump into engagement drivers?\nKen Lin: Yes, absolutely. So I think when we first started, people really questioned how engaging was the credit score and I think the reality is credit scores are something that take years to build and for many consumers, it is the hallmark of their financial health. So as a result, people tend to be very engaged in. So, your credit score changes on average once per month. We continue to add new products like credit monitoring, ID protection, Direct Dispute, which is a product that actually helps you to remove erroneous trade lines and debts from your credit report, the launch of our high yield savings product, all of these are product features that are created to help drive engagement, because we know consumers one, care about it, but two it\u2019s an important aspect of our business model and a key business driver.\nJosh Beck: Thanks. Congrats on the combination.\nKen Lin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Congratulations all. And Ken, if I could start off asking just the very last line of the pitch deck with regard to Credit Karma background, consumers on average use 1.1 financial products a year, please define what that is, how you use that as a driver of the business, what you have done to improve it and what benefits you think might you gain now as part of the combination?\nKen Lin: Yes. One of the neat aspects of our business is we can actually see how many trade lines are originated each and every year and what we find is that on average, it is 1.1 new trade lines and what that means is on average, a typical consumer will take out 1.1 new credit card, new auto loan, auto refinance, a mortgage, a store credit card. So anything that it shows and appears on your trade line, are on your credit report. We get to see that and we know that, that average is 1.1. Now specific to the business itself, what is really great is that it is highly predictable. So, we are going on our 12th year of operation. So, we have cohorts that go back 12 years and what we can see is that over time that consumers as they go through their lifecycle, their own life journey, they are able to sort of follow this pattern and we know that those credit originations are always in the market and we have an ability to both track our progress against it, but also anticipate what products consumers will need based on that rich data history that we have.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. I appreciate that. And then just shifting gears a little bit, Michelle, I guess I\u2019ll bring you in here. It was strong EPS outperformance relative to your guide in the second quarter and then it looks like the third quarter guide is a little light. I saw the 300 basis points of operating margin expansion year-over-year in Small Business and Self-Employed, just curious if there is a pull forward, what\u2019s driving the delta between the two quarters and just kind of some of the intricacies of this quarter and next? Thanks.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey, Scott. Thanks. First of all, I would say, when we really look at our expenses and our operating margin, we don\u2019t get overly focused on quarter-by-quarter. So, we are really managing it, number one, on an annual basis and we\u2019re also managing it \u2013 so that\u2019s why, if you start to look at it quarter-by-quarter, you start to look at segment-by-segment, you might get a little wrapped up in some numbers that aren\u2019t going to be as helpful to you. So we are focusing on total year at the company level. Yes, we did come in with operating expenses a little lower in Q2 and some of that is really being driven by different investment decisions we are making and also driven by some staffing and staffing cost and so forth that came in a little lighter in Q2, but we are not changing our full year operating income guidance. And so I wouldn\u2019t get too focused on the individual quarters.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Merwin: Thanks very much for taking my question. In terms of the current members of Credit Karma obviously I saw the number is $106 million, it\u2019s a huge number. And just thinking in terms of overlap with TurboTax, can you talk about what that might look like in any way that you can through integrations or anything kind of in the workforce, people go through those apps that they could \u2013 there is a cross-sell opportunity to either platform? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, it\u2019s not something at this point that we even know what the overlap is and one that we can communicate. All we can tell you is when we look at what\u2019s possible based on the benefits that we can deliver for customers, there is a lot of upside and we are excited about the opportunity, but it\u2019s not something at this point that we even have the data to share with you.\nChris Merwin: Got it. And just a quick follow-up on marketing, I know last quarter you talked about a pull forward on marketing spend to reach some of the early filers for TurboTax and looking at the consumer revenue growth rate, I think it was up 8% in the quarter, that\u2019s just below the full year guidance. So can you talk about some of the moving pieces in the quarter for consumer and your confidence level on I guess it represents an acceleration there into 3Q? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, sure. Well, first of all, I am confident in our strategy. I am confident in our execution and what we are seeing and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re growing the category, we\u2019re taking share and knock on wood, our teams have done an incredible job with the experiences that we\u2019re delivering for customers. So that\u2019s bucket one. Bucket two is very similar to what you heard from, Michelle there is only a few days of e-file revenue in that number. So actually, our marketing dollar spend and our revenue are not really correlated. It\u2019s really the number of days of open e-file and you will see our full year results after we get through after we get through the next season. We are seeing better traction than even last year when it comes to raising awareness, consideration and just a return that we are getting on our marketing dollars. So again things are in line with what we would have expected internally and we have high expectations.\nChris Merwin: Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Your line is open.\nDaniel Jester: Yes, great. Thank you for taking my question. Just going back to Credit Karma, obviously it affects one of your five big bets, but how should we think about how you are prioritizing kind of incremental investments in the other four big bets over the next year or two while you are focused on closing this transaction and integration? And I guess I am getting at is should we view this as kind of one really big bet and four medium-sized bets over the next year or two? And then I guess secondly, does this acquisition preclude you from doing anything kind of smaller or bolt-on in the rest of the business from an acquisition perspective? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, great. Thank you for the question. So first of all when we declared these five big bets and as we shared at Investor Day, they are grounded in fairly large customer problems that are very durable and areas where we believe that it\u2019s our obligation and our right to solve these customer problems and it\u2019s very durable and it also will result in the largest growth drivers for the company. In a couple of the bets, our gaps are probably larger than the other bets. First of all, they are all created equal, the five big bets, but we have deliberately stack ranked them the way we have, because we believe that if we had to make trade-off choices that we could be crystal clear how we would make trade-off choices. We have stacked all five bets to win internally. We made some significant investment in capital reallocations in the last year and we continue to do so to ensure that these big bets are resourced to win and with that as context, it actually doesn\u2019t change our M&A principles. I wouldn\u2019t conclude that we now have four large acquisitions coming because we have four other big bets. This is really about following our acquisition or our M&A principles around one of the largest customer problems and what are the gaps that we have and are there opportunities for us to be able to close that gap and increase speed to market and it just so happened that this bet, because really it\u2019s about serving consumers and helping them make ends meet that this just from our perspective is a great opportunity to bring two companies together to achieve greatness for our end customers. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it. Our M&A principles have not changed. Every bet is resourced to win, this was one of them where we felt like there is an opportunity to increase and improve speed the market.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to switch back to tax and specifically on some of the changes around the Free File Alliance agreement related to marketing, just curious if you are seeing any impact from that, whether it would be from traffic to your paid side or free-to-pay conversion or attach on of additional products like Audit Defense anything there?\nSasan Goodarzi: Just as context and a reminder, the Free File program is a philanthropic effort and we abide by the Memorandum of Understanding along with other industry players, which might have reaffirmed when the report was published I think in the fall and with that as context, we don\u2019t see anything outside of the norm, based on the way the season is playing out this year in FFA.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Thanks guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Looking at some of the available information here, it looks like the Credit Karma revenue base has been slowing over the past couple of years. It sounds like some of what Sasan and Ken have already mentioned here around data and financial partners can help stabilize that trajectory, but maybe it would be useful to hear more from Ken\u2019s perspective around how this combination of Credit Karma and the Intuit ecosystem can help stabilize and maybe even improve that trajectory going forward? Thank you.\nKen Lin: Sure. So if you really look at you know the history of Credit Karma, what we have been focused on, I often think about the first 12 years of our history as really helping consumers save money when they borrow, i.e., investing in our credit cards vertical, in our mortgage vertical, in our auto lending vertical. As we continue to grow, we have now focused on the other side of the balance sheet, i.e., high yield savings and other asset plays and what\u2019s key for our platform goes back to this note around engagement and the way that we think about accelerating revenue and what our models show is that the more engagement we have, there is a direct correlation to our revenue and where the opportunities come in is that a lot of the financial identity components that the combination of Credit Karma and Intuit have together, those are big growth drivers of engagement and we believe that over time that will both drive the SDUs or sort of the engagement numbers that we track, which leads to monetization and our ability to move into other verticals outside of traditional credit cards and personal loans. Those are sort of key growth drivers that we see in the business.\nMichael Turrin: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks. Hey guys. This is Jackson Ader on Sterling tonight. Just a quick follow-up on that last answer you gave, Ken, should we be thinking maybe about the growth forward coming more from having the monthly active members increase as a percent of the total number of members or will it be that total membership growth and the monthly active members should grow about in line with that?\nKen Lin: I don\u2019t have an exact breakout but we know that both are both extremely important aspects of our business. One of the nice key points of our business is any given quarter, approximately 90% of our revenues are repeating users or members that registered from prior quarters i.e., 10% are from new users. So we see a combination. Our ability to drive new users drives revenue and our ability to drive existing users back drive revenue, so both are really important and fundamental to the business model and the key metrics that we track.\nSasan Goodarzi: And if I could just add one thing, this is just from a go forward perspective, I think what\u2019s very just remarkable with respect to the company that Ken has built is when you have 106 million customers or members that use you, trust you, and you ultimately give the customer the ability to be able to leverage their data to be able to benefit from more and more choice, the opportunity that we have over time and again, Ken started the company with credit cards, personal loans, and now auto and home, but auto and home loans and insurance is actually kind of just at the beginning of what\u2019s possible. Then, there is this new vertical that\u2019s around savings, getting early access to your paycheck over time. So what I want you all to imagine is this truly being a consumer finance platform where it serves as a financial assistant in the pocket of consumers and the more we can deliver more benefits, the more engagement we drive over time and the more we can actually help financial services industry members be efficient and then therefore drive up ARPU and revenue and so this is just there\u2019s kind of many years of opportunity to capture the TAM that we described earlier.\nKen Lin: Yes. One final note is that a lot of that data is highly scalable. So the data that is used to determine your eligibility for credit card to a personal loan to a mortgage tends to be the same. So as we move into new verticals, your cost basis is relatively fixed, but you get a bunch of scale out of those operating cost basis. So as you\u2019re moving into new verticals, you often times get to expand your margins.\nJackson Ader: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Just a quick follow-up. So the last couple of years maybe, has that monthly active member number \u2013 has that grown in line with revenue, maybe below the revenue growth rate or even above?\nKen Lin: Yes. Historically, our engagement numbers have grown slightly faster than revenue and what we tend to find is our ability to launch new products like ID protection, Direct Dispute and the ones I mentioned before, high yield savings. We know that these directly correlate to the overall engagement of our user base, which is why we are so focused on driving an excellent customer experience, because we know those two things are highly correlated.\nJackson Ader: Okay, thank you.\nKen Lin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, Sasan, you talked about engagement maybe throughout the year with the TurboTax customers now that you have the Credit Karma platform or will have the Credit Karma platform. So I am wondering, will you change the branding or how will the branding work so that customers know that Credit Karma is part of the Intuit family?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, what we will do is when we, just like today, when we raise awareness and if it\u2019s TurboTax or if it\u2019s QuickBooks, you see Intuit, you see QuickBooks by Intuit or TurboTax by Intuit. So over time, we\u2019ll work with Ken and make sure that over time people know that Credit Karma is part of Intuit. What we won\u2019t do is change the brand of Credit Karma. It\u2019s established an incredible brand, it stands for choice and benefits for consumers and that is something that we wouldn\u2019t change because it has got a strong brand like QuickBooks or TurboTax has.\nKartik Mehta: And then you mentioned one of the opportunities is to leverage some of the information now that customers have with their tax returns and I\u2019m wondering what type of success you have or what percentage of customers are allowing you to use their financial information from a tax return so that you can assist them in other areas?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, if you recall, one of the things we shared at Investor Day, so it\u2019s a high number. At Investor Day, we shared that we have 37 million registered users that have actually agreed for their data to be used for benefits for them and then we have 4 million active users. So, consumers are very much willing to consent for their data to be used for their benefit as long as they are in control of it and so we\u2019ve actually seen very nice traction since we\u2019ve launched Turbo.\nKartik Mehta: And then just one last question, Michelle, if you look \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to give out financial information on Credit Karma other than maybe revenue, but if you look at the revenue profile, the margin profile of Credit Karma, is it at, above or below kind of corporate averages for Intuit?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey Kartik, you are right we are actually not in a position to give out any of the profitability information for Credit Karma. However, we do believe they are a platform and they have been driving some great engagement and scale and so we think that that\u2019s a great thing, but yes, we aren\u2019t actually able to share any of that information. Thank you, though.\nKartik Mehta: No worries. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, I am showing \u2013 we have reached our time for questions, would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, please. So first of all, thank you very much for all the questions and everybody\u2019s time today. I am truly excited for the progress that we are making, the acceleration that we have ahead with Credit Karma and I would just like to close by thanking our employees. Last week, we were named the number 11 in Fortune\u2019s Top 100 Companies to Work For in the U.S. and this is our second-highest ranking in the 19 years that we have been on this list and our employees\u2019 passion and commitment to really deliver for our customers and power their prosperity and to contribute in the communities that we serve really is what fuels our impact. So, it\u2019s an absolute honor to work alongside each and every one of our employees. And again, I want to thank everyone for joining and we look forward to speaking with you at the next earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start by providing an overview of financial results in the quarter, and then share more details on the proposed acquisition of Credit Karma we announced today. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of $270 million, a 16% increase, non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, a 13% increase, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, versus $0.72 a year ago, a 26% increase and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16, up from $1.00 last year, a 16% increase. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $499 million, up 8% for the second quarter. As we enter our third year of TurboTax Live, our technology-first approach continues to give us confidence we can expand our live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer term. As Sasan shared earlier, we are now using AI to automate repetitive tasks for experts on our platform, which we expect to increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience. Based on data published by the IRS, the broader tax season got off to a slow start through January, when total e-filed returns were down 0.7%. We remain confident in our plans and guidance for the year. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 8% in the second quarter, reflecting delivery of more forms during the second quarter as compared to the same period last year. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 17% during the second quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 43% in fiscal Q2 driven mainly by strong customer growth and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift. Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem; Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 23% in fiscal Q2. Within QuickBooks Online payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds from a mix shift to our full service offering. Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue again grew over 60%. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations, as QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter. Let me now spend a minute on the Credit Karma acquisition that Sasan and Ken described earlier. Intuit has agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $7.1 billion to acquire Credit Karma, comprised of half cash and half stock. The total consideration is subject to customary adjustments and includes an estimated $1 billion of equity awards that will be expensed over a period of up to three years. We will also deliver approximately $300 million of retention equity through restricted stock awarded to Credit Karma employees that will be expensed over four years. We plan to finance the cash portion of the transaction through cash and our existing unsecured line of credit. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of calendar year 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. We do not foresee an impact to maintaining our dividend and share repurchase principles due to the Credit Karma transaction. We expect the transaction to be neutral to accretive to Intuit's non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes. We will provide updated Intuit guidance once the transaction is closed. Now, turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. Our financial principles in total have not changed and remain a durable framework for us. We finished the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $139 million of stock in the second quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable April 20th, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our Q3 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.53 to $5.58, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.90 to $5.95. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q3 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. When we look at Credit Karma, they really bring a big track record of success with the beyond user paid business models. They have revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, which was growing at 20%. They've reached scale with high engagement, robust marketplace. We are really not able to share any of the profitability information at this point in time, but we do feel good about their platform model and the company's commitment to really serving and engaging their members. And then as we stated, we do believe that we will be in a neutral to accretive our position in our non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes. Hey, Scott. Thanks. First of all, I would say, when we really look at our expenses and our operating margin, we don't get overly focused on quarter-by-quarter. So, we are really managing it, number one, on an annual basis and we're also managing it \u2013 so that's why, if you start to look at it quarter-by-quarter, you start to look at segment-by-segment, you might get a little wrapped up in some numbers that aren't going to be as helpful to you. So we are focusing on total year at the company level. Yes, we did come in with operating expenses a little lower in Q2 and some of that is really being driven by different investment decisions we are making and also driven by some staffing and staffing cost and so forth that came in a little lighter in Q2, but we are not changing our full year operating income guidance. And so I wouldn't get too focused on the individual quarters. Hey Kartik, you are right we are actually not in a position to give out any of the profitability information for Credit Karma. However, we do believe they are a platform and they have been driving some great engagement and scale and so we think that that's a great thing, but yes, we aren't actually able to share any of that information. Thank you, though."

            "name": "Ken Lin",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. I'm incredibly excited about today's announcement. As Sasan mentioned through many conversations we have found a real shared goal for changing personal finance for the better of consumers. When we started the company in 2007, we had a fundamental belief that consumers are being left behind in financial services innovation. We started the company with a mission to Champion Financial Progress for All with the intention of leveling the playing field for all consumers. In 2008, we launched the Credit Karma platform by providing consumers completely free credit scores. Now, 12 years later we have provided more than four billion credit scores and created a platform with over 100 million members, over a third of which are active on the site every month. Notably, we are helping a new generation better manage their finances, as more than half of our members are under the age of 44. We use the term members because our users are unique, have verified information from a third party and begin an engagement loop with our products. When we started the business we saw consumers lost in a sea of complexity and the opportunity for technology to make a difference. Today, we are leaders and our business model is quite simple: we help consumers find the right product for them based on their credit and financial profile with their consent. Intuit enables us to strengthen this ability by allowing customers to add income data to that profile, enable members to see more offers through which they qualify. Then, we simplify the application process, we help members significantly increase their probability of approval, and we help members transparently compare rates and features. We do this for credit cards, personal loans, auto lending, mortgages, high yield savings accounts, auto insurance, home insurance and other verticals to come. So this opportunity is also meaningful and exciting for all our trusted partners, to believe that and support us throughout our history. These personalized recommendations are embedded by technology, and 8 billion daily model predictions. Perhaps what I am most excited about is the real impact we've had on consumers' lives. As one example, we have seen meaningful increases in credit scores from members who regularly engage on our platform overtime. There are many reasons why it makes sense to join forces with Intuit right now. First and foremost, we have the ability to collaborate and bring technology solutions to solve real consumer problems. We see a platform which provides consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information - including their income, spending and credit history - to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining a better interest rate. Our insights will significantly accelerate Credit Karma's mission and we will then make a larger impact on our customers more quickly than either of us are able to alone. With millions of customers, more financial partners, and more resourcing, I am convinced we will be able to build a more valuable business that enables us to achieve our combined goals. I also have to say that the culture and team Sasan has put in place are critical factors in our decision to join together. We got inspired by Intuit's mission to power prosperity around the world and our team is ready to join Intuit on that journey. To each of my 1,300 Credit Karma colleagues, Karmanauts, thank you. I am deeply proud of the company we have built and the culture we have created. We worked long and hard to get to a day like this, yet as I have always said -- this is one step in our journey together. Our mission to champion our members' financial progress remains the same. Now, with our partner with Intuit, we will have the resources and capabilities to achieve our goals in a remarkable, significant and impactful way. I'll pass it back to you, Sasan. Yes, absolutely. So thanks for the question. So autonomous finance right is really our ability to help consumers automate their financial life in a way that reduces friction, increases uncertainty, and creates more transparency and efficiency. So if you look at the problems that exist today, most consumers don't know which are the right products for them, they don't know how to apply for those products and there's so much friction to making it happen. So for us, our platform is really predicated on integrating with financial institutions so that you can make it easy, moving the dollars or automating the process itself, so it does not require as much work and therefore friction and then lastly, adding a layer of education to consumers to understand what is absolutely best for them and if you do that, we fundamentally believe we can level the playing field for the most disadvantaged and most vulnerable consumers and assist them. Thank you. Thanks, well, if you think about what Credit Karma does from a business model perspective, it's again providing consumers with the certainty of finding the right products at a great rate and some of the best rates in the market. That same problem exists for small business users and historically for Credit Karma is how it's been challenging to determine who are small business owners, I think that's an opportunity for us to work together in the sense that we are now able to solve that problem for not just consumers, but small business owners as well. So we think that's a big upside in the future. Yes. And maybe just to give you a little color on how you actually turn that into product when Sasan talked about income and the financial identity. One of the things that we observe in the space is that credit is a great predictor of underwriting about 80% of the time. Income and assets is the other piece and as you may know, 81% of consumers \u2013 sub-prime consumers are declined for credit card offers. So if we actually have the full picture and the full financial identity of that consumer, we are able to provide them certainty in the space and again going back to this note of the most vulnerable people, when you apply for a credit product and you are declined, your score goes down and you get into this vicious cycle of getting into predatory lending of products that aren't good for you. To Sasan's note around the data platform, with it, we'll be able to do things like automation of our cash flow. We'll be able to audit \u2013 autonomous finance for us as moving money in such a way that you can minimize the interest that you're paying. You can move in a way that your credit score and your outstanding balances are at lowest so you can actually get those other products to help you get through life and then when it comes to you to access to the other data points, I think things like improving savings where you know approximately half the country don't have $400 in savings. We can help improve that savings rates with our ability to foster money movement. Thank you. Yes, first, maybe let me frame the problem in the industry. So banks spend tens of billions of dollars each and every year marketing their financial services products and the challenge in the space is that each of those banks have a specific credit profile that they are looking for along with an ability to pay around income. Now imagine a bank that spends $100 million a year in marketing, maybe only 20% of those dollars are efficient because the other 80% go to people who are simply not qualified for that particular product. What we are able to do and speaking to this note around financial identity, we are able to help banks find those exactly right customers and I think that's the problem that we solve for our financial services partners. For the consumer, what they see is a landscape full of teaser rates, i.e., rates that are for extremely well qualified buyers. You actually can't tell if you're an extremely well qualified buyer because the banks use hundreds of different variables to determine your eligibility and what we're able to do is solve that particular problem for the consumer. So for our banking partners, they have access to a large scale of users that are highly qualified, for our members, we're able to provide a service that gives them certainty and transparency of all the offers in the market and as a business model, what we do is we charge a success fee for when we're able to match a consumer with the right financial services product and that is our business model and looking to capture all of those dollars that are being spent in digital and offline marketing today. Yes, absolutely. So I think when we first started, people really questioned how engaging was the credit score and I think the reality is credit scores are something that take years to build and for many consumers, it is the hallmark of their financial health. So as a result, people tend to be very engaged in. So, your credit score changes on average once per month. We continue to add new products like credit monitoring, ID protection, Direct Dispute, which is a product that actually helps you to remove erroneous trade lines and debts from your credit report, the launch of our high yield savings product, all of these are product features that are created to help drive engagement, because we know consumers one, care about it, but two it's an important aspect of our business model and a key business driver. Thank you. Yes. One of the neat aspects of our business is we can actually see how many trade lines are originated each and every year and what we find is that on average, it is 1.1 new trade lines and what that means is on average, a typical consumer will take out 1.1 new credit card, new auto loan, auto refinance, a mortgage, a store credit card. So anything that it shows and appears on your trade line, are on your credit report. We get to see that and we know that, that average is 1.1. Now specific to the business itself, what is really great is that it is highly predictable. So, we are going on our 12th year of operation. So, we have cohorts that go back 12 years and what we can see is that over time that consumers as they go through their lifecycle, their own life journey, they are able to sort of follow this pattern and we know that those credit originations are always in the market and we have an ability to both track our progress against it, but also anticipate what products consumers will need based on that rich data history that we have. Sure. So if you really look at you know the history of Credit Karma, what we have been focused on, I often think about the first 12 years of our history as really helping consumers save money when they borrow, i.e., investing in our credit cards vertical, in our mortgage vertical, in our auto lending vertical. As we continue to grow, we have now focused on the other side of the balance sheet, i.e., high yield savings and other asset plays and what's key for our platform goes back to this note around engagement and the way that we think about accelerating revenue and what our models show is that the more engagement we have, there is a direct correlation to our revenue and where the opportunities come in is that a lot of the financial identity components that the combination of Credit Karma and Intuit have together, those are big growth drivers of engagement and we believe that over time that will both drive the SDUs or sort of the engagement numbers that we track, which leads to monetization and our ability to move into other verticals outside of traditional credit cards and personal loans. Those are sort of key growth drivers that we see in the business. I don't have an exact breakout but we know that both are both extremely important aspects of our business. One of the nice key points of our business is any given quarter, approximately 90% of our revenues are repeating users or members that registered from prior quarters i.e., 10% are from new users. So we see a combination. Our ability to drive new users drives revenue and our ability to drive existing users back drive revenue, so both are really important and fundamental to the business model and the key metrics that we track. Yes. One final note is that a lot of that data is highly scalable. So the data that is used to determine your eligibility for credit card to a personal loan to a mortgage tends to be the same. So as we move into new verticals, your cost basis is relatively fixed, but you get a bunch of scale out of those operating cost basis. So as you're moving into new verticals, you often times get to expand your margins. Yes. Historically, our engagement numbers have grown slightly faster than revenue and what we tend to find is our ability to launch new products like ID protection, Direct Dispute and the ones I mentioned before, high yield savings. We know that these directly correlate to the overall engagement of our user base, which is why we are so focused on driving an excellent customer experience, because we know those two things are highly correlated. Thank you."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us. We posted strong results for the first half of fiscal year 2020. I am also excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to acquire Credit Karma, a pioneer in the financial technology sector, for approximately $7.1 billion. I could not be more enthusiastic about this transformational transaction and I am thrilled to welcome the talented Credit Karma team. Ken Lin, the Founder and CEO of Credit Karma is with us today to talk about our shared excitement and commitment to one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money. We posted a slide deck on our website containing an overview of the agreement which provides more details. Let me start with a quick recap of the quarter. We are halfway through fiscal year 2020 and continue to see strong momentum across the company as we make progress on our strategy to become an AI-driven expert platform. Second quarter revenue grew 13% overall fueled by 17% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 8% growth in the Consumer Group. Revenue for the Strategic Partner Group grew 8%. With this strong performance, we remain on track to deliver our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. Let me remind you of the customer problems that we are addressing. All of our customers are consumers and have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and payoff debt and those who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. To solve our customers' most pressing problems, we remain focused on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. We are working to achieve this strategy by pursuing five big bets. These include revolutionize speed to benefit, so our customers fall in love with the product instantly; connect people to experts to improve confidence; unlock smart money decisions to put more money back in our customers' pockets; become the center of small business growth by fueling our customers' growth; and disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. Throughout the call, I will update you on where we stand on these bets. With that context, let me start with tax. We are confident in our strategy and are on track to deliver and achieve our full year guidance. As a reminder, there are four key drivers of our consumer tax business. The first is total number of returns that is filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using DIY software. The third is our share within the DIY software category. And the fourth is the average revenue per return. Based on the latest IRS data and the DIY software category is performing better than assisted as it has for more than a decade. As the category leader, we view it as our responsibility to help drive category awareness and growth. So we are pleased with this result. Through February 7, IRS data shows total e-filed returns are up 0.6%, with self-prepared e-files up 3.5% and assisted e-files down 3.7%. Based on what we are seeing, our share within the DIY category is up year-over-year. We are growing the category and growing our share, which is right where we want to be. Our strategy for the Consumer Group is to expand our lead in the DIY category, transform the assisted tax preparation category and disrupt consumer finance. This is all in service of helping our customers make ends meet and get the largest tax refund. Let me share a few examples of how we are delivering for our customers this season. Within the DIY category, which is $3 billion in TAM, we are delivering enhancements to our premier offering to better serve customers with investments. We are driving faster growth in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx and Self-Employed. We are also expanding free eligibility to include all enlisted active duty military and reservists and providing historical tax return access for all customers. In the assisted category, which is $20 billion in TAM, we continue to make progress with our second big bet to connect people to experts with TurboTax Live. We are working to further increase customer confidence on our platform by enhancing first time use. This season, we improved accessibility back to experts by offering customers the option to connect with an expert when they first sign-in to TurboTax Live to address top of mind questions. We also introduced real-time chat and a floating Live Help button to make it easier to connect with live help at all stages of the return process. We continue to accelerate the application of AI to create tools for experts to automate repetitive tasks, increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience. Beyond tax, we continue to make progress disrupting consumer finance, which represents $29 billion in TAM. This aligns with our third big bet to unlock smart money decisions. Through our Turbo offering, we are addressing key customer problems like managing debt, saving money and improving financial health overall. We are building on last season's success by expanding the financial marketplace. We are now live with pre-qualification partners offering both credit cards and personal loans to help customers save money and to provide partners with more qualified leads. Nearly 25% of our weekly active users have set a credit score, savings or debt-related goal in Turbo and we expect this to drive higher engagement over time. Acquiring Credit Karma expands our TAM from $29 billion to $57 billion accelerating our time to market moving beyond tax while also developing new ways to monetize our offerings. Now, turning to small business, we delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%, exceeding our target to grow more than 30%. We continue to solve key customer pain points as we execute on our big bets. We remain encouraged with our early results with QuickBooks Live, part of our second big bet to connect people to experts, opening access to a $10 billion bookkeeping opportunity. QuickBooks Live solves one of the customers' biggest needs confidence and peace of mind, while helping experts grow their business and find new customers. We are now also offering setup help, providing customers with confidence from the moment they subscribe. We are working to achieve our vision of being the center of small business growth, our fourth big bet, by helping our customers get paid faster, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We introduced a new payroll lineup featuring full service across all offerings as well as TSheets integration for time tracking that's resulting in customers adopting TSheets at 3x the rate they did prior to launching the integrated offering and a tax penalty free guaranteed for select offerings. We also introduced a feature that double checks customers' over time calculations, reducing the likelihood of fines and penalties. We continue to make progress on our fifth big bet, disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings. Approximately 75% of our current QBO Advanced customers have traded up from our existing QBO product, unlocking benefits such as faster invoicing with batch import tools, automation, more customized fields and user permissions. Now, I want to address the news we announced today to acquire Credit Karma. I have long been an admirer of the company that Ken and his team have built. As we have gotten to know each other, Ken and I realized we both share one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money. This combination fits directly with Intuit's mission and long-term strategy. Our mission is to power prosperity around the world. And our bold goal for 2025 is to double the household savings rate for customers on our platform. This acquisition is a giant step forward in achieving that goal and significantly accelerates execution of our big bet to unlock smart money decisions. This big bet is aimed at helping consumers address the personal finance problems they face today helping them reduce debt, maximize savings and put more money in their pockets. Today, many consumers struggle with not knowing or fully understanding where they stand with their finances and they struggle to make ends meet. Household debt in the United States hit $14.1 trillion. 23 million consumers relied on at least one payday loan in 2018 to get faster access to cash. If consumers just had the tools to better understand their financial health and opportunities to improve it, they could unlock billions of dollars of potential savings. For example, understanding the difference and availability of lower cost personal loans versus high cost credit cards could save consumers $20 billion to 40 billion. And Credit Karma estimates that 80% of Americans overpay on car loans to the tune of $37 billion as there is no easy way to compare offerings. Consumers want to do better and 60% say they are trying to improve their credit score, but they need help. We aspire to do more and Credit Karma is the perfect partner to help us do this. Credit Karma shares our goal of making it simple for consumers to make better decisions with their money through a platform that works like a personalized financial assistant, helping consumers find the right financial products, putting more money in their pockets and providing them with insights and advice. This platform will provide consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information, including their income, spending and credit history to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining better interest rates. The result will be a complete financial profile that puts the power in consumers' hands so they can take the steps necessary to improve their financial health. Let me tell you what this will look like. To find the right financial products, we will match consumers with pre-approved offers on personal loans, home loans, credit cards and insurance. We will put more money in their pockets by connecting them to higher yield savings accounts and faster access to their hard earned paycheck. We will also provide insights and connect them to experts to help consumers make better decisions about their money and improve their credit score. All of this will be done by leveraging artificial intelligence and connecting consumers to over 100 financial partners on the platform solving a two-sided problem. This consumer finance platform offers compelling value for our financial institution partners as we provide efficient access to a broad set of qualified customers. While consumers strive to be more informed about their finances and want personalized offers from a trusted source, financial institutions want high-quality leads and face real challenges matching their products to the right customers. We can help them target their offers based on metrics like verified income and credit history giving them the ability to reach qualified prospects. Ken will get into this shortly, but Credit Karma's history is remarkable. The Credit Karma platform has attracted more than 100 million members, with 88% engagement via mobile among active users and over one-third of which are active on the platform each month. The platform has a net promoter score of 69. The company recorded revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, growing 20% year-over-year. Impressively, over 90% of Credit Karma's annual revenue results from existing members returning to the platform. Together, we can deliver unprecedented benefits to customers, combining the benefits of scale, trust and data. Let me turn it over to Ken, Credit Karma's founder and CEO, to share his perspective on the transaction. Awesome. Thanks, Ken. I'd like to add that while we see a lot of innovation and investment, in the marketplace we don't see anyone with our collective capabilities pursuing a personalized financial assistant. This is why we believe this combination can transform FinTech and power the economy. We have the ability to bring together consumers and financial institutions in innovative ways that lowers costs for all those involved and levels the playing field for consumers of all economic status. After the transaction closes, Ken will report to me, and continue to lead the Credit Karma team from its headquarters in San Francisco. Credit Karma will continue to operate under its current brand. Michelle will share the financial details of the transaction in a few minutes. To wrap up, we are pleased with the continued momentum of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group. We remain laser focused delivering for our customers during tax season and I could not be more excited about the Credit Karma acquisition and the opportunity it provides us to power prosperity for our customers. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. I would like to thank our employees, our customers and partners for another strong quarter. I am excited about joining forces with Credit Karma and the transformative experience we can offer customers together. We will share more about our progress in the coming months. Now, let's open it up for questions to hear what's on your mind. Great. Hey, Brad. Thank you for your question. We are equally admirers of Credit Karma. A couple of things, I would say. Let me start with your question as to why now? This is very core to what we have declared around helping our customers make ends meet. It's very core to the strategy that we've declared, which is about an AI driven expert platform and what we declared is that because everyone that we serve are consumers, we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions and together with Credit Karma there are things that we can do to benefit consumers that we believe are significant. First and foremost, consumers are in significant debt. They over pay on fees whether it's credit cards, whether it's home loans, auto loans whether it's insurance. They don't have access to advice in terms what are the things that they need to do to improve their credit score and their credit rating which matters a lot, so when it comes to the interest that they pay and also just the other side of it, which is how do they save money and how do they ultimately grow that money and in order to really be able to deliver against that, what we bring together with Credit Karma is scale and capability, it's scale of customers and scale of customers' data and it's the capability that we have and so ultimately now, customers are going to be able to leverage their own data, their income data, their spending data, their credit history, their life situations. I mean, together with Credit Karma, the customers will have access to all their information in one place and then we'll be able to match them with financial products that are right for them. We'll be able to connect them to savings accounts. We'll be able to help them get early access to their pay check and we will be able to provide insights and advice so they can actually continue to improve their financial habit. So in terms of why is this the right time. It's absolutely core to what we've declared, its core to the goals that we've set, and we believe that together we can truly do things that benefit consumers and benefit financial institutions because we will provide them also more choice. So that's why it's the right time. I think in terms of acquisitions, I would just say that the last several that we've made have been extremely successful and we've actually held them up as role models internally and we've recently talked to our board about it. TSheets [indiscernible] just two of the latest three and the reason is we've studied our history and we've learned what works and what doesn't work and the clarity that we have around three things that matter, one is the mission and purpose \u2013 the alignment that we have with Ken and the team; two, the absolute alignments that we have on priorities; and third, and I would say equally as important is Ken is in charge. Our goal is to fuel his success and Credit Karma's success and just how we've organized around the work is essential to the success. So across the board, we have a lot of confidence and are very clear about how to manage the risks. Got it. Great. Thank you, Keith for the question. Let me just start with tax, our intent is to keep the free tax software within Credit Karma because we believe in what they are doing and the fact that customers should have choice and we are not doing this deal because of tax. They have 106 million customers and really we are doing this because we believe that we can truly create a consumer finance platform that can serve as a financial assistant to really power the prosperity of customers. So that is really the strategic rationale and reason for the deal and we will continue to offer taxes for free through Credit Karma and through TurboTax and we're very confident in that go-forward approach. In terms of Mint and Turbo, I think I would go back to what I shared a moment ago with Brad. We are very focused on helping customers make ends meet and we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions for our customers and ultimately, this is really about speed the market. This is really about bringing the capabilities of the two companies together, the scale of the customers' data and capabilities to be able to move much faster to help these customers that are really underserved, struggling and are looking for help and that's really the rationale for why we are doing this and specifically around Mint and Turbo, our game plan over time is actually to combine that into one app and we want to focus entirely on Credit Karma's growth and we don't actually want to distract Credit Karma at all with the fact that there is Turbo and there is Credit Karma. The reality is customers have choice and they'll be able to pick the product that's right for them. Sorry, go ahead. No, no, they will be \u2013 ultimately, they will be separate. They will not be combined into one app only because I think our focus is we have a huge opportunity to ensure that we can fuel Credit Karma's growth and we don't want to have any distractions other than ensuring that they can deliver for customers, so they will be separate apps. Yes and Keith, just a note on Credit Karma, I think from our perspective, we're neither a credit score company nor are we a tax company. We focus on solving consumer problems. So for us, our members who are coming to us asking for credit scores are really asking for how can they borrow at the best rates possible and on the opposite side of that when consumers are coming to us from our tax product, it's really about getting their dollars back from the government and sort of doing the necessities. So we think of that not as a product per se, but really the problems or the challenges that we're solving on behalf of our members. Thank you. We are actually very pleased with the progress and the results that we're making. I mean, first, I would start by saying, as the category leaders, our focus is to grow the category, which we feel like we've had a large part in doing so given what the stats I shared earlier that the do-it-yourself category is growing faster than assisted and we have been able to increase our share and a driver of us being able to increase our share is the continued traction and growth with TurboTax Live and we are very pleased with the results that we're seeing and it's in line with what we would expect through this early part of the season and I think I would just remind that we are so early in our journey of going after this $20 billion market of transforming the assisted marketplace that we expect continued accelerated growth from TurboTax Live given that it is a seamless platform for customers to use at the ease of their home or office and they can get access to expertise at anytime they wish throughout the experience. So we are just at the beginning of the journey of what's possible with TurboTax Live. I can't comment on H&R Block other than I really love what we're seeing in our results, we are growing the category, we're taking share and we are seeing the growth that we would have expected in TurboTax Live and continuing to benefit from our focus around the first time use, more access points for experts, and making the expert platform easier that gives us the opportunity to ensure efficiency and expanding margins over time. So we \u2013 and by the way, we also have experienced that more folks that enter the category, the more we're actually able to accelerate the growth in the category. So far, what we are seeing is exactly what we would have expected. Yes, this is about acceleration. The way you should think about this is we get to expand our TAM, we are acquiring a business that has incredible capabilities of $1 billion growing 20% plus with a platform model that has the ability to grow operating margins over time and frankly, more importantly, all of that is possible because we are able to do things for consumers and provide them more choice and more benefits and do the same for financial institutions. I would look at this as, it's squarely focused on one of our five best that we declared and it's all about acceleration while we continue to see acceleration really connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live, and some of what we're doing on the small business front. So this is about acceleration. Very welcome. Let me start and I'll have Ken add. One of the things that we've been very intentional and working with Ken and the team on is alignment on purpose and vision, alignment on priorities, and ensuring that Ken is in charge and has what he needs to be able to deliver for customers and accelerate Credit Karma's growth and so we believe that there is an opportunity serving small businesses, but ultimately over time, Ken will decide when is that right time because ultimately we want to \u2013 there is so much opportunity ahead of us, but let me let Ken jump into that because I know he's been thinking about small businesses for some time. Well, as you know, when we talked about our long-term expectations and in essence shared that it's between 8% to 12%, one of the larger drivers of that was ARPU simply from the standpoint that we are focused on transforming assisted with our platform and there is just an opportunity to increase our ARPU. We'll share after season how that's performing, but I would tell you everything that we see so far in early season \u2013 there's results that you see because there is three days to four days of IRS opening, which is very a small portion of the results and there is what we see you through year-to-date and season to date and it's really in line with what we had assumed and again, we like what we see. Sure. Thank you, Kirk for your question. Let me kick this off and I'll let Ken chime in because the business plan that's been developed has been jointly developed that will be executed after close. First of all, as I mentioned, there is alignment around mission and purpose and we've also aligned around priorities. The priorities that we have aligned around is grow the core, it's expand growth verticals and it's developing emerging verticals and specifically, grow the core is really about growing credit cards and personal loans. Expanding growth verticals is about auto and home loans and insurance and then developing emerging vertical is really about providing offerings like savings, checking and then over time early access to your paycheck, etcetera . So those are the three priorities that we have agreed to. Now, what's wonderful on behalf of consumers are the capabilities that we can bring together and so the first is creating a financial identity for the consumer. What that means is the consumer now based on the data that we have the 50 million customers and 106 million customers that Credit Karma has, the consumer now has access to their data in one place, their income data, their spending data, their credit history data, their life situation. I mean, Credit Karma has 2,600 data points for each of their customers on average and so creating a financial identity for the customer so they can use their data for their benefit is one thing that we will do together. The second is making our money movement capabilities, the services available for Ken and the team. That's all of our risk and fraud capabilities that we use for same-day payroll, same day payments, all of that is necessary for Ken over time to be able to provide early access to consumers' paychecks as an example. And then last but not least, we will make our financial data platform capabilities and services available to Ken so he can deliver benefits to customers and this is where we have 20,000 partners in our financial data platform where, again, all of this will be used with the customers consent and to their benefit. So when I talk about allowing Ken to be in charge and running Credit Karma, we will make those data elements and services with the customers consent available on the back end so that ultimately Ken can deliver more benefit for Credit Karma customers over time and that's where we see the acceleration and we don't want to distract Ken and Credit Karma with anything else other than what's most important to deliver for customers. So that's the approach that we're taking. Great. Thank you, Kash. Let me hit on a couple of these and then I'm going to ask actually Ken to jump in and just share more around the business model. First of all, this is really one view of having a network effect. It's truly solves a two-sided problem. The more consumers consent with their data being used at more financial institutions and others participate on the platform, the stronger the platform gets to deliver for the end consumer, the more choice that it provides and so from a network effect perspective, this has some of those characteristics. In terms of synergy, it's really what we were just describing earlier, really what you are now able to bring together with the two companies is the customers' entire financial identity where they can use their data to get access to the best personal loans that are right for them, the best credit cards that are right for them, the best by the way, insurance, it could be home insurance, auto insurance, renters insurance because when the customer doesn't have all their data in one place, they in essence have experiences that Ken was just talking about earlier where they may get something where they are pre-approved for, but when they actually try to go through the process, 80% of them get rejected and now by the data being in one place, it actually accelerates us delivering the benefits and that's where the real synergy comes into places where we can do things together that we couldn't do apart. In terms of ASP, maybe let me let Ken just talk about the business model and how it works because that will be really the key characteristics moving forward. Yes, great. Thank you for your question. Let me kick it off and then I'm going to turn it over to Ken to talk about all the incredible work they have done that drives all the engagement and then some of the new verticals that Ken described we're going into. I think to your first part of your question, from a strategic perspective, in context of going after the pain point of making ends meet, this really for the consumer front for the most part shifts us from engaging very infrequently and maybe once or twice a year to now engaging customers year round and delivering significant benefit and as we talked about earlier, you got 106 million members, 37 million that are monthly active and those that are monthly active, they engage four times a year and the excitement that we have around benefits that we can deliver and what's possible in the long-term is the more offerings that we can provide truly becoming this financial assisted in the pocket of our customers where they can get access to credit cards at the best rates that are right for them, personal loans, home loans, auto loans, insurance whether it's renters insurance or home insurance, savings accounts, early access to their paychecks that drives real benefit, real engagement and higher engagement over time, but what's remarkable about the company, Ken and the team have created is it's just at massive scale already. Now with that said, maybe Ken you can jump into engagement drivers? Thank you. Yes, it's not something at this point that we even know what the overlap is and one that we can communicate. All we can tell you is when we look at what's possible based on the benefits that we can deliver for customers, there is a lot of upside and we are excited about the opportunity, but it's not something at this point that we even have the data to share with you. Sure, sure. Well, first of all, I am confident in our strategy. I am confident in our execution and what we are seeing and as I mentioned earlier, we're growing the category, we're taking share and knock on wood, our teams have done an incredible job with the experiences that we're delivering for customers. So that's bucket one. Bucket two is very similar to what you heard from, Michelle there is only a few days of e-file revenue in that number. So actually, our marketing dollar spend and our revenue are not really correlated. It's really the number of days of open e-file and you will see our full year results after we get through after we get through the next season. We are seeing better traction than even last year when it comes to raising awareness, consideration and just a return that we are getting on our marketing dollars. So again things are in line with what we would have expected internally and we have high expectations. Very welcome. Yes, great. Thank you for the question. So first of all when we declared these five big bets and as we shared at Investor Day, they are grounded in fairly large customer problems that are very durable and areas where we believe that it's our obligation and our right to solve these customer problems and it's very durable and it also will result in the largest growth drivers for the company. In a couple of the bets, our gaps are probably larger than the other bets. First of all, they are all created equal, the five big bets, but we have deliberately stack ranked them the way we have, because we believe that if we had to make trade-off choices that we could be crystal clear how we would make trade-off choices. We have stacked all five bets to win internally. We made some significant investment in capital reallocations in the last year and we continue to do so to ensure that these big bets are resourced to win and with that as context, it actually doesn't change our M&A principles. I wouldn't conclude that we now have four large acquisitions coming because we have four other big bets. This is really about following our acquisition or our M&A principles around one of the largest customer problems and what are the gaps that we have and are there opportunities for us to be able to close that gap and increase speed to market and it just so happened that this bet, because really it's about serving consumers and helping them make ends meet that this just from our perspective is a great opportunity to bring two companies together to achieve greatness for our end customers. So that's the way I would think about it. Our M&A principles have not changed. Every bet is resourced to win, this was one of them where we felt like there is an opportunity to increase and improve speed the market. Just as context and a reminder, the Free File program is a philanthropic effort and we abide by the Memorandum of Understanding along with other industry players, which might have reaffirmed when the report was published I think in the fall and with that as context, we don't see anything outside of the norm, based on the way the season is playing out this year in FFA. You are very welcome. And if I could just add one thing, this is just from a go forward perspective, I think what's very just remarkable with respect to the company that Ken has built is when you have 106 million customers or members that use you, trust you, and you ultimately give the customer the ability to be able to leverage their data to be able to benefit from more and more choice, the opportunity that we have over time and again, Ken started the company with credit cards, personal loans, and now auto and home, but auto and home loans and insurance is actually kind of just at the beginning of what's possible. Then, there is this new vertical that's around savings, getting early access to your paycheck over time. So what I want you all to imagine is this truly being a consumer finance platform where it serves as a financial assistant in the pocket of consumers and the more we can deliver more benefits, the more engagement we drive over time and the more we can actually help financial services industry members be efficient and then therefore drive up ARPU and revenue and so this is just there's kind of many years of opportunity to capture the TAM that we described earlier. Yes, what we will do is when we, just like today, when we raise awareness and if it's TurboTax or if it's QuickBooks, you see Intuit, you see QuickBooks by Intuit or TurboTax by Intuit. So over time, we'll work with Ken and make sure that over time people know that Credit Karma is part of Intuit. What we won't do is change the brand of Credit Karma. It's established an incredible brand, it stands for choice and benefits for consumers and that is something that we wouldn't change because it has got a strong brand like QuickBooks or TurboTax has. Yes, if you recall, one of the things we shared at Investor Day, so it's a high number. At Investor Day, we shared that we have 37 million registered users that have actually agreed for their data to be used for benefits for them and then we have 4 million active users. So, consumers are very much willing to consent for their data to be used for their benefit as long as they are in control of it and so we've actually seen very nice traction since we've launched Turbo. Yes, please. So first of all, thank you very much for all the questions and everybody's time today. I am truly excited for the progress that we are making, the acceleration that we have ahead with Credit Karma and I would just like to close by thanking our employees. Last week, we were named the number 11 in Fortune's Top 100 Companies to Work For in the U.S. and this is our second-highest ranking in the 19 years that we have been on this list and our employees' passion and commitment to really deliver for our customers and power their prosperity and to contribute in the communities that we serve really is what fuels our impact. So, it's an absolute honor to work alongside each and every one of our employees. And again, I want to thank everyone for joining and we look forward to speaking with you at the next earnings call. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins., Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after the call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start through the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and continue to make progress on our strategy of becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. First quarter revenue grew 15% overall, fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 35%, exceeding our target to grow 30% or more. Consumer Group revenue grew 11% and Strategic Partner Group revenue was in-line with our expectations.  This is a great start to the year. At Investor Day, I shared our top five priorities, which we call our big bets. These big bets focus on the largest problems our customers face, and also represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I'd like to share our progress on each of these. Our first bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers when they use our products and services. We aim to deliver instant benefit and make the interactions with our offerings frictionless by accelerating the application of Artificial Intelligence. This big bet is foundational to everything that we do for our customers and positions us to accelerate execution across our other four bets. Here are a couple of examples of the progress we're making. First, we are on a path to triple the number of customers who can apply for working capital loans through QuickBooks Capital by extending eligibility to our desktop customers using machine learning. QuickBooks Capital leverages customers' data to provide loans to small businesses, nearly 60% of whom may not qualify for loans elsewhere. Second, we're enhancing our ability to answer customer questions more efficiently through TurboTax self-help. By leveraging A.I., we are delivering more relevant answers at the point of need and using natural language processing to expand personalized answers with TurboTax Assistant. In fiscal 2019, we handled millions of calls from customers needing help while using TurboTax. We expect this capability to improve customer satisfaction survey results and reduce customer contact rates by helping customers find answers to their questions more easily.  Our second big bet is to connect people to experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence - to do their own taxes and to manage their business. We're connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem, allowing us to gain share and grow average revenue per customer or ARPC. We are happy with the progress that we are making. We launched QuickBooks Live, connecting small businesses with live experts, opening up access to a new $10 billion market opportunity. This offering is intended to increase our small business customers' confidence, helping them get set up, close their books each month and ensure their records are accurate and up-to-date. Over the last six months, we've run more than 50 tests to learn about what customers truly need, helping us develop the offering, and refine our go-to-market and pricing strategies. At the same time, we continue to build out the expert pipeline, as 90% of TurboTax Live experts expressed interest in working with QuickBooks Live. In TurboTax Live, we continue to innovate in making our experts more accessible at different touch points as we see a 32-point improvement in conversion for first time filers when engaging with an expert. This season, we're launching real-time chat, an enhancement our customers have asked for since the inception of TurboTax Live. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions for customers by connecting them to financial tools, partners and benefits that help put more money in their pockets. Through our offerings, we are addressing key customer problems by helping them reduce high cost debt, grow emergency funds and improve their financial habits. Based on what we learned from the tests, we ran during the extension season, we are optimistic about our ability to go beyond tax to help our customers make ends meet. For example, we introduced credit score goal setting and payment history tracking in Turbo to help customers improve their credit score. This is a key step to improving their overall financial health. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We introduced new QuickBooks innovations at our flagship QuickBooks Connect conference earlier this month, to further support our customers' small business growth. For example, we announced a cash flow planner to help our small business customers make better decisions as they grow. We also announced receipt capture in the mobile app and enhanced mileage tracking, to enable our customers to automatically deduct expenses seamlessly. All of these innovations put more money in our customers' pockets, and should increase their success. Over time, we see the opportunity to better serve product-based businesses by transforming omni-channel commerce, benefiting customers who sell products through multiple channels. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. This offering will help us increase retention of these larger customers, and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings. We continue to make progress building out the offering since launching last year. For example, we recently introduced a revenue streams dashboard that allows customers to easily compare revenue across products and services, projects, customers, employees and other attributes to better understand their business performance. In summary, the entire company is focused on executing against these big bets to deliver for our customers and accelerate growth. Before I hand it to Michelle, I want to address the questions we've been getting on our free strategy. While the debate continues around whether the government should present a tax bill, or taxpayers should prepare their own returns, our primary focus remains on meeting our customers' needs, helping them maximize their tax refund, and going beyond tax to help them make ends meet. Let me give you some additional context around free. Based on IRS estimates, nearly 104 million Americans are eligible to file for free through the IRS Free File program. However, that number doesn't tell the whole story. Recently the IRS asked an independent organization, MITRE, to conduct a study of the Free File program. The study concluded that overall the Free File program was effective and that the majority of these 104 million taxpayers make a personal choice to use an alternative filing method for a variety of reasons. For example, many taxpayers - regardless of their income or complexity - prefer to have assistance as they lack the confidence to file on their own. As a result, the study concluded that the actual number of filers using DIY software and eligible to use Free File is roughly 30 million customers. Over 20 million taxpayers are already filing for free, either through Free File or commercial free offerings including many not eligible for Free File. And roughly 13 million of those Americans filing for free used TurboTax software and paid Intuit nothing. This is a testament to the quality of our free offerings \u2013 both the product we donate to the IRS Free File program and our commercial free offering. We offer millions of customers the option to file for free because we believe they will stick with us over time as their life changes and their tax situation becomes more complex in the future. Therefore, we remain very confident in our durable free strategy. So wrap up, we are very pleased with our results in the first quarter. And we remain focused on delivering against our objective in fiscal 2020.  Thank you. And now let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. \nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. GAAP operating income of $10 million, versus a loss of $10 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income of $129 million, versus $102 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22, versus $0.13 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.41, up from $0.29 last year. Turning to the Business Segment Results. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 15% during the first quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 41% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by strong customer growth, and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift. Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue - which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital - grew 27% in fiscal Q1. Within QuickBooks online payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds from a mix-shift to our full service offering which is priced 75% higher than self-service. Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew over 60%. I am also excited to share that in the U.K., we now hold the number one position for cloud accounting subscribers. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the first quarter, in-line with our expectations. Note that the first quarter is our largest desktop quarter of the year reflecting the annual launch of a new version of QuickBooks desktop software.  Consumer Group revenue grew 11% in fiscal Q1. During the October tax extension season, we ran three times the number of tests we did two years ago. These tests will inform our tax offerings for the upcoming season. We're gearing up for our third season offering TurboTax Live. We're continuing to test new customer experiences as we work to provide our customers an even higher level of confidence this season. We are also seeing great engagement from experts, and over 90% of those we asked back plan to return this season. Our technology-first approach gives us confidence we can expand our Live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer-term. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, in-line with our expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions about the macro environment and what we're seeing in our business. At this time, we're not seeing any evidence of a slow-down in our business related to the macro-economic environment. Charge volume trends remain strong, and the number of employees being paid in our ecosystem remains on trend. Turning to our Financial Principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities at the company, with an emphasis on becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $139 million of stock in the first quarter. We have approximately $2.5 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable January 21, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our Q2 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 11% to 13% percent, GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.73, and Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.03.This earnings guidance reflects a shift of marketing investments for Consumer Group into our fiscal second quarter. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q2 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks Michelle. As I shared with you at Investor Day, all of our customers have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt. And those who've made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs - and go into business for themselves - have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. We remain focused on becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform, to solve our customers' most pressing problems.  Now let's open it up for questions to hear what's on your mind. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Wong - Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKenneth Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm not sure if this goes this Sasan or Michelle, but Michelle towards the end you mentioned that you guys are going to bring some marketing spin into 2Q. Can you help us understand just based on your learnings from last year what kind of returns you guys are looking for? What are some of the areas, channel wise or other that you guys might be putting this money behind? And when we think about kind of that incremental spin, is it fair to assume that that's pretty much just all sales and marketing and not kind of other line items?\nSasan Goodarzi: Hey. Thanks for your question. This is Sasan. First of all, it is all pretty much marketing and it's really focused on ensuring that we can raise awareness to transform the assisted category. As we've talked about before, really last year was our first year in raising awareness in terms of you can do your taxes and we'll be there every step of the way for you, and we can help you. We're really doubling down on that this year and based on the behaviors that we learned last year, we felt that shifting more dollars to raise awareness early in the season and throughout the season will give us the opportunity to serve as many customers as we can. So that's really the primary driver for it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. I'll follow up on the second quarter guidance question just on, it sounds like it's entirely pull forward of marketing spend that has an adverse impact in the second quarter uniquely. I was just curious what is your expectation for the start of the tax season? I don't think the IRS has announced it yet. I'm just curious what type of -- what you're expecting and how that affects the 2Q guide? Thanks. \nSasan Goodarzi: First of all, you're absolutely right. It's all marketing based on what I just described earlier. And what we expect based on customer behavior and when the IRS opens is that just like we've seen in previous years, the moment the W-2's hit the door, those early filers are going to be ready to file and we're going to be there for them. I want to make sure that we raise awareness that they know we're ready for them, and that they can have help if they need it. And then two, give them the ability to be able to file their taxes and get their refunds right away. And so we're really obsessively focused on our customers and making sure that they're ready to file the moment the IRS opens.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks Sasan. And any just not looking for much of a change in a year-over-year as far as the start of the tax season now just to the extent you can answer that.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Not really much of a change other than again what we've learned and what we're going to do differently from an execution perspective. We don't expect much of a behavior change and that's all of what has informed our guidance for the quarter, and we remain of course committed for the year.\nScott Schneeberger: All right. Thanks very much on that. And then I recently attended the QuickBooks Connect, it's very dynamic event for sure. I was just curious if you could give us an update, Sasan, comparing and contrasting what you're seeing thus far with QuickBooks Live customers and/or staff, well not and/or and staffing relative to it when you initiated TurboTax Live? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Well, first of all, thank you for attending QuickBooks Connect. I was truly blown away by just a number of innovations from our team, and they use QuickBooks Connect as the opportunity to launch many of innovations across many fronts. And of course inspired by our customers and their passion. We actually use QuickBooks Connect as really an opportunity to activate QuickBooks Live. We had thousands of accountants and pros there and there was a great opportunity just to share the fact that we're solving a two-sided platform or a two sided problem I should say and the opportunity they have to solve those very problems on our platform for our customers and generate more income. And I would tell you in the two sessions that we did it was standing room only with folks knocking on the door after they got their questions answered to figure out how to participate on joining the other platform. In terms of customer insights and learnings, we ran over 50 tests in the last six months both in terms of really getting the product market set thinking through, go-to-market and pricing strategies. And we feel that we're really positioned for something that's very early in its journey going into busy season, helping customers get set up, providing help along the way when they need it. And in some cases doing it for them. So we're excited heading into busy seizing in January knowing that our primary focus is to learn. But so far both on the pro side and customer demand side, it's been exciting to watch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Wells of Citi. Your line is open.\nMatthew Wells: Hi, Sasan, Michelle. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the customer cohorts that are purchasing QuickBooks Advance? Are they existing desktop ecosystem customers or they net new to the -- net new into enter the platform?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. The primary focus that we have are our customers that have between 10 to 100 employees, but that's not --it's not a hard line. It really depends on the number of customers that they have. The number of invoices that they have to do. The number of accounts payables that they have, and just a scale in which they operate. And so far and our primary focus has been ensuring that we take care of our existing customers. Those that are ready to upgrade to a platform that can better serve them and perform for them. While we build our capabilities to also acquire new. So we've seen about a 75%, 25% mix, 75% existing customers upgrading and 25% new. And over time, we expect that to evolve a bit because we want to actually accelerate the acquisition of new customers that we have. As we've shared before, there's about 180,000 customers within QBO base that are a fit for QBO Advanced. And so our primary initial focus in the coming kind of year and 18 months as our existing customers. But that's the mix we're seeing so far when new customers find out that we have the capability. They're just naturally coming over to the platform.\nMatthew Wells: It's really helpful color. And switching gears to the consumer segment, with the pull forward of marketing spend are there any specific products you plan to lean into here? Is it going to be focused on TurboTax Live or some of the lower tier SKUs?\nSasan Goodarzi: It's all the above. Our teams have worked really hard this year in context of enabling us to expand our lead in doing yourself category, enabling us to transform the assisted category and going beyond tax and finding ways to provide benefits beyond tax. And so really the focus areas has been self employed. It's been Latinx. It's been improving our experiences for those that have that investments and stocks allow at the same time making sure help is available through TurboTax Live for all the cohorts. So really what we've learned in the last couple of years is all customers seek help from day one. And so we're ready to provide that both through if you want to do it yourself or through live. Well at the end of the tax experience helping you understand that there's ways to save money. There's ways to connect to financial products that are right for you to get out of debt over time. So we're really ready on all those fronts from day one because what we've learned is customers have those needs from day one when tax season opens up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMark Randy: Hi. Mark Randy here on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for taking my questions. So first maybe on QuickBooks Live. How much of the existing QBO base do you think will be interested in that? And kind of just how traction have been going and do you expect this to be a material contributor to revenue growth this year or maybe next year? Any color on that would be helpful.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. First of all, important reminder that we're very early in our journey with QuickBooks Live. Literally, we just went GA and use QuickBooks Connect to activate it and we're excited about what more we can learn. So it's very early in the journey. There are a lot of similarities to TurboTax Live and the similarities are because of customer behaviors. The largest problem our customers face whether it's a consumer or a small business is confidence. It's confidence whether or not they're making good business decisions. Whether they need access to capital? Whether they're going to be able to make their payroll this coming week? How to think about profitability for their customer?  So it's really a confidence problem and the confidence question that they have, which means that this will apply to a cohort and a portion of our existing base, plus it's really an opportunity to penetrate non-consumption. A lot of customers that sit on the sidelines and use Google sheets and Excel and then just use a pro to help them run their business. This becomes the potential trigger for them to switch. And we're seeing all of that. We're seeing existing customers opts for help. And we're seeing new customers that are come in opting for either getting set up or engaging for help along the way because they need advice. So thus far we're seeing it across the spectrum. We really have not accounted for this to be a material impact for our revenue in this coming year. Again, we are --this is we are early in the journey, but this is one of the company's five big bets and we believe that it's a huge customer problem, and a big growth driver for the company in the future.\nMark Randy: Great. Thanks so much. And maybe one more quick one. On the UK subscribers where you now hold the number one position. Can you talk a little bit about the driver of that growth? Is like the making taxes digital acts still a big tailwind and how do you see that trending, I guess, for the rest of the year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I am extremely proud of our team. Five years ago, we weren't even on the map in the UK and they set a goal to maniacally focus on customers getting to product market fit, and when we do making sure that we really execute against our go-to-market strategies and raise awareness. And I would say, it's their hard work and focusing on product market fits. It's gotten us to the number one position because making taxes digital has been an opportunity for everyone. But our team has really done an incredible job nailing the product experience. Of course, we always have room to improve and really accelerating marketing investments and now our expectations are to really hold that number-one position to continue the growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your question please.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. I think this one is a Michelle question to start with. But given the commentary of international growth being greater than 60%. If I look at some of the metrics we've got in the past, namely international subs growth in the high 50s, I think at Analyst Day last year or earlier this year it was discussed that average revenue per customer is actually down in international. It feels like that's an acceleration, but I'm not -- I'm also comparing apples and oranges a little bit. So maybe just can you comment a little bit on that? How should we sort of put 60% north to 60% growth in the context of some of the metrics we've gotten in the past and what that trajectory looks like? \nMichelle Clatterbuck: HI, Jenni. Yes. The total international online revenue growth for Q1 was 60% and obviously a lot of that was driven through the UK. As Sasan just mentioned, with the move into first with online accounting subs in the UK that has been a driver of the revenue growth. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. We do believe that international longer term is a large opportunity for us. Right now the revenue from international is still a very small portion of our overall. But we are seeing the UK picking up steam there and we would expect that to continue.\nJennifer Lowe: Okay, great. And then just one more on QBO for me. You mentioned subs growth being the majority of the driver, but also higher effective prices in QBO, and there's a few reasons why that could be. But can you just give us a little color on what is driving that higher effective price and what the durability of that might look like as we move through the year? I mean is it just sort of one up in pricing or is it mix? Or what -- how should we think about that going forward?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: We are really pleased when we think about small business. We have the three pillars to the strategy of grow the core, connecting the ecosystem and expanding globally. And we're pleased with the growth we saw in grow the core with online accounting in Q1 of 41%. Of the majority of that was driven by customer growth, the vast majority of that. Part of that to a lesser extent that was our higher ARPC, the higher effective prices there that is some price increase, but it's also lowered discounting. And then we also had the impact of some mix shift, the higher price products which is like QBO Advance. That's really was driving that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nYao Chu: Hi. This is Yao Chu on for Brad Zelnick. Congrats on the quarter. Just I had a question on competition here. H&R Block seems to coming out earlier this year on pricing in a very aggressive way especially on free online, where they continue to message the differentiation from TurboTax. Any initial comment on that in terms of pricing, especially in the free SKUs? And is this related to the pull forward in marketing spend in the next quarter in any way?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, thank you for your question. Our choices and investments are really focused on our beliefs around what we can execute against and really grow the category and grow share. It has not anything to do with any choices that H&R Block has made. And I mean I can't comment on the choices that we've -- that they've made, but I have a lot of confidence in the choices that we've made and our focus as we head into see them.\nYao Chu: Great, thank you. And the second question here, just moving to the UK again, congrats on the number one position. Can you remind us of the offering there internationally, is payroll and payments available, has QBO Live or Advanced started to scale or if so, when would these be made available on an international basis?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. So, in terms of what's available in the UK, it is our QBO platform and we have app partners that solve some of the most pressing problems for our customers. The primary problems around payment employees like payroll and payments is all through partners. So we do solve those very important problems, but they're all through partners. Our intent is ultimately to roll out QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live in the UK and beyond. There are critical opportunities to solve customer problems and they're drivers of growth for the future. So we're -- we've been very deliberate about getting the product market fit in the US while the platform is global-ready in building the capabilities to roll this out globally and UK and then Canada will be the first stops.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Hi, Sasan. Nice to see the UK in the pole position. If you look at other surrounding international countries in kind of stack ranked where you're most excited. Could you walk through where you are on, maybe, perhaps to where some areas that you wish you'd -- you're making bigger improvements that you think that may take a little bit longer time, but are there any other markets that you're seeing that could be in the UK position here shortly? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, sure. Well, first of all, just as a -- if I could remind all of us that, outside the US we're in UK, Canada and Australia where we've gotten the product market fit and then there are emerging markets that we're focused on which is France, Brazil and India. And we are excited about the UK, but we are very hungry because I think we just think we're getting started in the UK, especially to solve customer problems in a way that will drive revenue growth. Our focus has been growing our customer base and growing share and now it's about accelerating to build a big business over time. So that's from just -- if I could paint a picture of where we are in the UK, I would just say, we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity ahead. And I would say we're in the same place in Canada. The growth in Canada, based on just the market dynamics is a bit slower, but the same opportunities still exist in Canada. And so, those are two markets where we believe that there is an opportunity for, over time, contribution to revenue growth. In terms of the emerging markets, the two that we are continuing to see progress, it's not yet material from the lens of how much it contributes, but we're excited about is France and Brazil. We're seeing really good traction in France. We're seeing good traction in Brazil. Those are markets that are very different, but the opportunities are, in the long term, ones that we like. And India is one that we continue to focus on product market fit. We have not made the progress that we would want to see us ourselves make in India and we're really still searching for product market fit. there, but when I look at UK, Canada, Australia, France and Brazil, I just view that we have good opportunities outside of the US and it's sufficient and we're being very intentional and deliberate in India in terms of the deliverables and what we're focused on to see if we can get the product market fit.\nBrent Thill: And just a quick follow-up for Michelle. Nice earnings beat. Was there anything that didn't get spent that you were hoping to spend that it seems like you're maybe pushing some things around that maybe that marketing spend didn't get fully flush through in Q1 that goes to the next quarter or is it -- or was it not the case?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: No. For Q1, we really didn't see much of that. As we called out, we are pulling in some of the marketing expense to Q2 for the Consumer Group, but when you look at our Q1 and what we were trying to accomplish there, our spend was pretty much where we had anticipated it to be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan, your question please.\nSterling Auty: Yes, hi, thanks. I actually want to follow up on that last point. If we look, obviously, you overperformed very nicely out of revenue, but just given the operating income guidance that you gave, it does look mathematically like you under spent on total expenses in the quarter. So, maybe not in marketing, but was there anything else in cost of revenue or something else that led to the total expenses coming in shy of what the operating income guidance would have implied?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: When we really look at our guide for the year, I would continue to encourage you to look at the guide for the year. When we look at our spent I don't get really concerned with quarter-to-quarter. There's always going to be some quarter-to-quarter shift in some expenses. And so, that's why I would continue to focus on the total year. We did reiterate the year for our guide. And so, yes, there is always going to be a little bit of movement between quarters. That's just something that I don't get overly focused on because we really do look at the total year and the total Company, and not worry too much about the individual quarters.\nSterling Auty: That's fair. And then Sasan, you talked about some of the big bets and initiatives, I didn't hear. One of the things on QuickBooks was to help the product-based businesses, specifically with consolidating orders, I think was the imperative. Any update on that initiative?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. So one of -- as you suggested, one of our bets is about being the center of small business growth. And one element of that is to be really be able to transform omni-channel commerce. And our focus, first and foremost, we do have a roadmap of what problems we want to solve and when, and the first set of deliverables are really about enabling customers to see all their orders in one place. So if they sell on Etsy, if they sell on Amazon and then if there is orders coming in from their own website, one of the biggest challenges that they had is actually seeing everything in one place and then eventually understanding their profitability in having a tighter inventory. So the first step in terms of what our teams are focused on is delivering that on the road map and we've not yet delivered it. But we're excited about the clarity that we have in terms of what we need to do for customers and then a road map that we've got the right team behind. So we'll certainly, on a quarterly basis, provide an update to you all, but we're excited about the progress that the team is making.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nKevin Kumar: Hi, this is Kevin on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. We see a lot of third-party solutions in the QuickBooks ecosystem, including acquisitions Intuit has made such as TSheets. I guess as the growth focus shifts more toward revenue per sub, does it make more sense to do strategic acquisitions to more fully monetize the ARPU opportunity?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Our principles really are clear in terms of what guide decisions that we make. First and foremost, it's about what's most important to our customers. The second is actually being able to solve that extremely well. And then the third is really assessing whether it's core versus context and how critical it is to the masses. And if its core, like TSheets is a great example of -- although we were partners with TSheets, what we learned and found out over time is that time tracking is very core to us. And the reason it's core to us is that it's a big input into automating the data that we get and therefore how we leverage the data applying artificial intelligence to it to really deliver more innovation for our customers. And so those are the principles and then drive whether it's partnership versus acquisition. It's less about just monetization. Of course, monetization matters over time. But first and foremost, it's about customer problem, can we solve it well and is it core versus context and then we let that drive whether it's a potential build acquisition or if it's a partnership.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Sasan, I wanted to circle back just on QuickBooks Connect and maybe just some of your takeaways, I guess, in terms of when you look at QuickBooks Live, in particular, what are maybe some of the things we should think about that could either help throttle adoption faster, the things that maybe people are sort of worried about or things you think some of the accounts just have to kind of get more comfortable with to maybe see some real acceleration in adoption? I'm sure you're expecting good adoption already, but just kind of wondering if you had any quick takes on that in terms of some of the questions you were getting back more specifically? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, absolutely. If I could start with broader context. The whole purpose of QuickBooks Connect, which is something we started about five years ago was really to bring the ecosystem together. It's the ecosystem of our partners, our customers, our employees and really leveraging it as a launching pad from new innovation for training for our customers actually providing best practices in terms of how do you grow your firm, how do you go your practice, how do you grow your business. And it's something now that we stream outside of the 5,000 folks that attended, really, as a platform to launch big innovation, teach how to grow your business and it's a huge opportunity for us to learn. And so, at QuickBooks Connect there was a number of things that we launched, whether it's the line-up for payroll and some of the new innovations around auto pay, integrations to TSheets or cash flow planning where a small business can now understand their cash flow issues, plan for their cash flow so that they can make better decisions, which is the number one reason why small businesses go out of business, to many innovations and launches on the accountant platforms, how the accountants do a better job running their business and running their firm. So I wanted to start with a broader context of those many aspects of, and in many areas across the platform where we shared new innovations across the board. Specifically on QuickBooks Live, although we ran 50 tests over the last six months and have been in market and learning along with making sure that accountants are aware of our narrative of what we're trying to do here, we really use QuickBooks Connect as an activation platform. And I would tell you that once we got through these two standing room only sessions, there was incredible excitement about being part of the platform, because ultimately, they have the ability to grow their income, grow their practice and serve customers and do something that they don't like, which is marketing. We also addressed concerns because if you are not aware of the narrative as an accountant, you have a natural concern, which is, is Intuit trying to compete with me and is Intuit trying to take business away from me? We believe, by the way, that will always be a concern that will be out there until we get our narrative to every single pro and enrolled agent and accountant that's out there. And so we were excited about QuickBooks Connect because we were able to address some of those questions, some of those concerns face to face. And we had, by the way, well over 1,000 folks that wanted to sign up on the platform after those events, which, by the way, blew us away. We did not have those high of expectation. So net-net, this is a two-sided problem. The most important of solving the problem for small businesses and solving the problem for pros, which is helping them grow their practice. And we feel good about what we're learning. We feel good about our progress and QuickBooks Connect was a great activation event.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much. On TurboTax Live, do you expect to increase headcount this year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Well, let me start with, we are still very early in the journey of TurboTax Live. As we've talked about before, there are 86 million folks that go to someone else to have them do their taxes for them. It's a $20 billion opportunity and we just got started a couple of years ago. And so our number one focus is customer growth and we're very focused this year on first time use additional access points so that you can get access to experts and improving the experience for experts. We do expect to increase the number of pros because now we're actually -- it's both for QuickBooks Live and our TurboTax Live. And actually that's where being a platform and leading this in a digital way really comes into play because it's about having experts for both platforms. But we do expect it to grow it. We do not expect to grow it in any way, shape or form as fast as our revenue will grow, but being very intentional to ensure that we have enough people to serve our customers. And I think I would just remind us that this is a technology-driven expert platform, which means that we're really applying AI to efficiently and effectively deliver experiences for our customers and that we do not see this as a impact on margin at all this year or beyond.\nBrad Reback: Great. And then just on one unrelated follow up, with the Windows 10 upgrade cycle looking to abate in the first half of calendar '20, should we expect that to have any impact on the desktop business post that? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: We have not included any expectations of that sort in our guidance, nor do we expect that just from an execution perspective, but, of course, we're ready for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about QB desktop. And it had a really strong quarter in Q1. I guess do you expect that to continue? And then Sasan, how do you think about QuickBooks Online or -- sorry, QuickBooks Live as being a potential accelerant for conversions from QB desktop to QBO?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. So when we think about desktop in the long term, first and foremost, we are obsessively focused on delivering for our desktop customers while educating them on the benefits of the cloud, because they can -- over time, they can run their business in a much more effective way on the cloud, but what's important and what we've learned from our own experience is educating them on the benefits of the cloud and also educating them in terms of what's different on a cloud platform versus a desktop platform is very important because our desktop customers, whether TurboTax our QuickBooks, they love their desktop. So that's point number one. We do expect that this is a business that will decline over time. What's really kept it at the level that it's been at, has been our enterprise desktop business that's been growing double digits, but we don't -- we -- the expectations that we've shared on desktop with you all, still stand. In terms of QuickBooks Live, it certainly could be a potential catalyst. We have no proof at this point that it is, because we're really focused on our online customers. The real catalyst will be educating our desktop customers as to the benefits of online and making sure that they're prepared to make that jump. And I think we will just see a natural migration as we've seen over the last several years and QuickBooks Live could play a role. At this point, we don't have proof that it will and the biggest opportunity is really with non-consumption and current customers.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then just as a follow-up to that on QuickBooks Live, with some of the early testing you've done and the feedback you've gathered, have you had any surprises either positive or negative that were unexpected?\nSasan Goodarzi: Was your question on QuickBooks Live?\nAlex Zukin: Yes.\nSasan Goodarzi: Got it. Sorry. You cut out on me. I would say the biggest surprise that we've had is the very number of needs that the customers have. There are customers that will come in and just say, hey, here's all of my stuff from Word, from Excel, from Google Sheets, all the receipt boxes that I have. Can you just help me get set up. So I know what's going on in my business with QuickBooks and help me understand how to then run QuickBooks. So that -- the whole notion of set up, has been a huge need for customers and then the other is actually just advice. This is my cash flow, this is my net income, now that I understand it, what choices can I make? When will I need access to capital? Is it worth for me to take out capital? Should I buy more inventory? I've sat multiple times in different sessions listening to calls between our bookkeepers and small businesses, and just the amount of reliance and need that they have to understand what's going on in their business, what choices that they have. Intellectually, we all understand it, but when you really listen to these calls you get how important advice is, how important expertise is, and how much they lack confidence. And so, that's not a surprise, but just when you listen to these calls, they just amplifies how important it is. But I would say this whole notion of getting set up and understanding what's going on in my business and how blind that they are, and what's happening has been probably the biggest surprise and the biggest need that we're looking to figure out how to solve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJosh Beck: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Capital. Certainly AI in underwriting has been one of the focus areas, I think, underneath that theme. So are you getting to a point when you think about inflecting that business and grow it quicker and you think about maybe some of the ancillary announcements like you just mentioned, like Cash Flow Planner that we're may be on the cusp of seeing more loans facilitated or is it more likely to be kind of a steadier pace as we've seen in terms of the additional origination volumes?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. We use -- first of all, I'll step back and reiterate how the ecosystem works together and what we're excited about is the notion of a customer being on our platform to get organized, to be able to invoice and get paid, to be able to pay their employees and with Cash Flow Planner, actually we can now give customers insight as to whether or not they even need access to a loan, but the loan is not the only way to solve their problem. It's also, do you want -- you want us to follow up with some of your customers that are overdue to get paid, you want to slow down paying a few vendors so you can make your payroll Friday. So, the Cash Flow Planner is really to help them thrive, to help them make better decisions because they're lonely and running their business. They don't have business partners to give them analytics and Cash Flow Planner is really -- is just going to be the beginning of something that will be their -- kind of their assistant in their pocket, if I may, to then offer ways for them to run their business, access to capital could be one. The second element to get to your question, there are two ways that we provide capital. One is the marketplace. One is through our own capital where we are partnered with a blue-chip financial firm where they had no recourse, but we also have provided access in that way. And based on the growth that we see, we continue to both leverage our blue-chip partner and the marketplace. And it's all really driven by the demand that we see both on our online platform and our desktop platform. So, it's an important retention driver. Over time it could be a growth driver, but most importantly what it's doing is helping our customers thrive and be able to get through the tougher earlier years to be able to survive as a business and improve their success rate.\nJosh Beck: Okay, very helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up, maybe for Michelle. I noticed very modest deceleration in the Online Services growth. Should we be thinking that's driven by things like law of large numbers, obviously, international mix seems to be going up. So I'd imagine that would probably -- maybe pressure this line. So, anything to call out on the modest decel that we've seen there?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: For Online Services, first of all, I'd say that we continue to be focused on our Online Ecosystem revenue growth of greater than 30% and that was 35% for the quarter. In Online Services for the quarter, we did grow 27% and the two major drivers there were QuickBooks payroll and payments and then to a lesser degree time tracking and QuickBooks Capital. One of the things that I would remind everyone about which you may be seeing is that, Online Services has parts that are growing very nicely, but it also has a part of it -- about 25% of Online Services that's non-integrated payroll and payments offering and that isn't growing. And so, that's some of what you're seeing there, but we're very pleased with the growth that we've seen there and expect that to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacqueline Cheong of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJacqueline Cheong: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. This is on behalf of Kash Rangan. I have a couple of questions around QBO Advanced. What's the go-to-market strategy for this product and what has initial customer feedback been like? And then, finally can QBO Advanced be a catalyst for more QuickBooks Desktop customers to move to QBO?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Yes. I'll start at the top, which is, there is about 1.5 million customers in the mid-market and we define mid-market as 10 to about 100 employees and it's about a $40 billion market based on the math that we've done when you include services. And when we think about our go-to-market, our initial focus is our existing customers. We have about 180,000 QBO customers that outgrow QBO. And ultimately, they need a platform that can perform at a different level that has rules and permissions, that has integrations with CRMs that meet their needs, just as an illustrative example. And so our go-to-market is really making sure our existing customers are aware of the platform, and right now, we're actually seeing a 75% of our growth coming from existing customers and about 25% of the customers are new. Eventually over time, we are right now building the capability, we're studying the best practices externally of those that have served the mid-market very well, putting together a great talented team that knows how to serve the mid-market and then ultimately, our plan is to raise awareness top of the funnel and pursue these mid-market customers that typically by the way, are still running their business on Excel, on Google Sheets are stretched in, use multiple accountants and so we foresee the combination of QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live working very well together. In fact, a certain percentage of our current QuickBooks Live customers are QuickBooks Advanced customers. And so, when you think about our bets, one connecting people to experts and then the second is disrupting in the mid-market, they actually play very well together hand-in-hand. And what we've learned seen so far is a lot of delight from our existing customers where they see that this platform can meet their needs. Over time, it can be a source of reason for migration from desktop to QuickBooks Advanced. But right now, our main focus is existing QBO customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks. A lot of questions were answered, so I'll make it a short one. You talked -- what you talked earlier about the international and the UK, Canada, and that you are still working on market fit for India. The other two that you have done a lot of work around was France and Brazil. Can you just double click on that one where we are in the evolution there? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, for sure. So France is really where the US was about 15 to 20 years ago. There is already a financial management solutions category, primarily on desktop. Most accountants are on desktop and light desktop, but now we're seeing small businesses want to use the cloud, because they see that it's far better to be able to use a cloud platform to be able to run their business. And they are now engaging accountants to be able to pull accountants to be able to come to the cloud so they can, in essence, help them run their business on the cloud. And that's really where the US was 15 to 20 years ago. And our team has done really a wonderful job of getting the product market fit by blocks. And what I mean by that is, we're focused on a street in Paris and making sure that we nail the experiences for that street in Paris and then go to the second street in Paris. And now we're starting to expand across Paris because the fastest way to get the product market fit is one customer at a time. And so we're seeing a nice acceleration. And we foresee, given our progress that France could be interesting and material three to five years from now. And again, it's where the US was about 15 years ago. Brazil had a large compliance marketplace; it's mainly an account marketplace. Brazil is a market where they rely heavily on services. And so the likes of QuickBooks Live, if I could use that as an example, is a natural thing that they would actually go to, which is they would love for an accountant to do all their business taxes for them and to be able to provide advice for them. And so those are some of the tests that we are now running in Brazil, which is shifting more toward services because that's what the market is oriented toward. So very different marketplaces in very different place. And I like the progress of our team. But again, these are more -- think about these opportunities three, five years out from now, don't look at them as near-term opportunities.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you very much for your questions and we look forward to chatting with you at our next earnings call. Have a great rest of the day and great rest of the week. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. GAAP operating income of $10 million, versus a loss of $10 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income of $129 million, versus $102 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22, versus $0.13 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.41, up from $0.29 last year. Turning to the Business Segment Results. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 15% during the first quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 41% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by strong customer growth, and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift. Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue - which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital - grew 27% in fiscal Q1. Within QuickBooks online payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds from a mix-shift to our full service offering which is priced 75% higher than self-service. Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew over 60%. I am also excited to share that in the U.K., we now hold the number one position for cloud accounting subscribers. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the first quarter, in-line with our expectations. Note that the first quarter is our largest desktop quarter of the year reflecting the annual launch of a new version of QuickBooks desktop software.  Consumer Group revenue grew 11% in fiscal Q1. During the October tax extension season, we ran three times the number of tests we did two years ago. These tests will inform our tax offerings for the upcoming season. We're gearing up for our third season offering TurboTax Live. We're continuing to test new customer experiences as we work to provide our customers an even higher level of confidence this season. We are also seeing great engagement from experts, and over 90% of those we asked back plan to return this season. Our technology-first approach gives us confidence we can expand our Live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer-term. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, in-line with our expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions about the macro environment and what we're seeing in our business. At this time, we're not seeing any evidence of a slow-down in our business related to the macro-economic environment. Charge volume trends remain strong, and the number of employees being paid in our ecosystem remains on trend. Turning to our Financial Principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities at the company, with an emphasis on becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $139 million of stock in the first quarter. We have approximately $2.5 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable January 21, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our Q2 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 11% to 13% percent, GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.73, and Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.03.This earnings guidance reflects a shift of marketing investments for Consumer Group into our fiscal second quarter. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q2 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. HI, Jenni. Yes. The total international online revenue growth for Q1 was 60% and obviously a lot of that was driven through the UK. As Sasan just mentioned, with the move into first with online accounting subs in the UK that has been a driver of the revenue growth. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. We do believe that international longer term is a large opportunity for us. Right now the revenue from international is still a very small portion of our overall. But we are seeing the UK picking up steam there and we would expect that to continue. We are really pleased when we think about small business. We have the three pillars to the strategy of grow the core, connecting the ecosystem and expanding globally. And we're pleased with the growth we saw in grow the core with online accounting in Q1 of 41%. Of the majority of that was driven by customer growth, the vast majority of that. Part of that to a lesser extent that was our higher ARPC, the higher effective prices there that is some price increase, but it's also lowered discounting. And then we also had the impact of some mix shift, the higher price products which is like QBO Advance. That's really was driving that. No. For Q1, we really didn't see much of that. As we called out, we are pulling in some of the marketing expense to Q2 for the Consumer Group, but when you look at our Q1 and what we were trying to accomplish there, our spend was pretty much where we had anticipated it to be. When we really look at our guide for the year, I would continue to encourage you to look at the guide for the year. When we look at our spent I don't get really concerned with quarter-to-quarter. There's always going to be some quarter-to-quarter shift in some expenses. And so, that's why I would continue to focus on the total year. We did reiterate the year for our guide. And so, yes, there is always going to be a little bit of movement between quarters. That's just something that I don't get overly focused on because we really do look at the total year and the total Company, and not worry too much about the individual quarters. For Online Services, first of all, I'd say that we continue to be focused on our Online Ecosystem revenue growth of greater than 30% and that was 35% for the quarter. In Online Services for the quarter, we did grow 27% and the two major drivers there were QuickBooks payroll and payments and then to a lesser degree time tracking and QuickBooks Capital. One of the things that I would remind everyone about which you may be seeing is that, Online Services has parts that are growing very nicely, but it also has a part of it -- about 25% of Online Services that's non-integrated payroll and payments offering and that isn't growing. And so, that's some of what you're seeing there, but we're very pleased with the growth that we've seen there and expect that to continue."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start through the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and continue to make progress on our strategy of becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. First quarter revenue grew 15% overall, fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 35%, exceeding our target to grow 30% or more. Consumer Group revenue grew 11% and Strategic Partner Group revenue was in-line with our expectations.  This is a great start to the year. At Investor Day, I shared our top five priorities, which we call our big bets. These big bets focus on the largest problems our customers face, and also represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I'd like to share our progress on each of these. Our first bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers when they use our products and services. We aim to deliver instant benefit and make the interactions with our offerings frictionless by accelerating the application of Artificial Intelligence. This big bet is foundational to everything that we do for our customers and positions us to accelerate execution across our other four bets. Here are a couple of examples of the progress we're making. First, we are on a path to triple the number of customers who can apply for working capital loans through QuickBooks Capital by extending eligibility to our desktop customers using machine learning. QuickBooks Capital leverages customers' data to provide loans to small businesses, nearly 60% of whom may not qualify for loans elsewhere. Second, we're enhancing our ability to answer customer questions more efficiently through TurboTax self-help. By leveraging A.I., we are delivering more relevant answers at the point of need and using natural language processing to expand personalized answers with TurboTax Assistant. In fiscal 2019, we handled millions of calls from customers needing help while using TurboTax. We expect this capability to improve customer satisfaction survey results and reduce customer contact rates by helping customers find answers to their questions more easily.  Our second big bet is to connect people to experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence - to do their own taxes and to manage their business. We're connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem, allowing us to gain share and grow average revenue per customer or ARPC. We are happy with the progress that we are making. We launched QuickBooks Live, connecting small businesses with live experts, opening up access to a new $10 billion market opportunity. This offering is intended to increase our small business customers' confidence, helping them get set up, close their books each month and ensure their records are accurate and up-to-date. Over the last six months, we've run more than 50 tests to learn about what customers truly need, helping us develop the offering, and refine our go-to-market and pricing strategies. At the same time, we continue to build out the expert pipeline, as 90% of TurboTax Live experts expressed interest in working with QuickBooks Live. In TurboTax Live, we continue to innovate in making our experts more accessible at different touch points as we see a 32-point improvement in conversion for first time filers when engaging with an expert. This season, we're launching real-time chat, an enhancement our customers have asked for since the inception of TurboTax Live. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions for customers by connecting them to financial tools, partners and benefits that help put more money in their pockets. Through our offerings, we are addressing key customer problems by helping them reduce high cost debt, grow emergency funds and improve their financial habits. Based on what we learned from the tests, we ran during the extension season, we are optimistic about our ability to go beyond tax to help our customers make ends meet. For example, we introduced credit score goal setting and payment history tracking in Turbo to help customers improve their credit score. This is a key step to improving their overall financial health. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We introduced new QuickBooks innovations at our flagship QuickBooks Connect conference earlier this month, to further support our customers' small business growth. For example, we announced a cash flow planner to help our small business customers make better decisions as they grow. We also announced receipt capture in the mobile app and enhanced mileage tracking, to enable our customers to automatically deduct expenses seamlessly. All of these innovations put more money in our customers' pockets, and should increase their success. Over time, we see the opportunity to better serve product-based businesses by transforming omni-channel commerce, benefiting customers who sell products through multiple channels. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. This offering will help us increase retention of these larger customers, and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings. We continue to make progress building out the offering since launching last year. For example, we recently introduced a revenue streams dashboard that allows customers to easily compare revenue across products and services, projects, customers, employees and other attributes to better understand their business performance. In summary, the entire company is focused on executing against these big bets to deliver for our customers and accelerate growth. Before I hand it to Michelle, I want to address the questions we've been getting on our free strategy. While the debate continues around whether the government should present a tax bill, or taxpayers should prepare their own returns, our primary focus remains on meeting our customers' needs, helping them maximize their tax refund, and going beyond tax to help them make ends meet. Let me give you some additional context around free. Based on IRS estimates, nearly 104 million Americans are eligible to file for free through the IRS Free File program. However, that number doesn't tell the whole story. Recently the IRS asked an independent organization, MITRE, to conduct a study of the Free File program. The study concluded that overall the Free File program was effective and that the majority of these 104 million taxpayers make a personal choice to use an alternative filing method for a variety of reasons. For example, many taxpayers - regardless of their income or complexity - prefer to have assistance as they lack the confidence to file on their own. As a result, the study concluded that the actual number of filers using DIY software and eligible to use Free File is roughly 30 million customers. Over 20 million taxpayers are already filing for free, either through Free File or commercial free offerings including many not eligible for Free File. And roughly 13 million of those Americans filing for free used TurboTax software and paid Intuit nothing. This is a testament to the quality of our free offerings \u2013 both the product we donate to the IRS Free File program and our commercial free offering. We offer millions of customers the option to file for free because we believe they will stick with us over time as their life changes and their tax situation becomes more complex in the future. Therefore, we remain very confident in our durable free strategy. So wrap up, we are very pleased with our results in the first quarter. And we remain focused on delivering against our objective in fiscal 2020.  Thank you. And now let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Great. Thanks Michelle. As I shared with you at Investor Day, all of our customers have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt. And those who've made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs - and go into business for themselves - have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. We remain focused on becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform, to solve our customers' most pressing problems.  Now let's open it up for questions to hear what's on your mind. Hey. Thanks for your question. This is Sasan. First of all, it is all pretty much marketing and it's really focused on ensuring that we can raise awareness to transform the assisted category. As we've talked about before, really last year was our first year in raising awareness in terms of you can do your taxes and we'll be there every step of the way for you, and we can help you. We're really doubling down on that this year and based on the behaviors that we learned last year, we felt that shifting more dollars to raise awareness early in the season and throughout the season will give us the opportunity to serve as many customers as we can. So that's really the primary driver for it. First of all, you're absolutely right. It's all marketing based on what I just described earlier. And what we expect based on customer behavior and when the IRS opens is that just like we've seen in previous years, the moment the W-2's hit the door, those early filers are going to be ready to file and we're going to be there for them. I want to make sure that we raise awareness that they know we're ready for them, and that they can have help if they need it. And then two, give them the ability to be able to file their taxes and get their refunds right away. And so we're really obsessively focused on our customers and making sure that they're ready to file the moment the IRS opens. Yes. Not really much of a change other than again what we've learned and what we're going to do differently from an execution perspective. We don't expect much of a behavior change and that's all of what has informed our guidance for the quarter, and we remain of course committed for the year. Well, first of all, thank you for attending QuickBooks Connect. I was truly blown away by just a number of innovations from our team, and they use QuickBooks Connect as the opportunity to launch many of innovations across many fronts. And of course inspired by our customers and their passion. We actually use QuickBooks Connect as really an opportunity to activate QuickBooks Live. We had thousands of accountants and pros there and there was a great opportunity just to share the fact that we're solving a two-sided platform or a two sided problem I should say and the opportunity they have to solve those very problems on our platform for our customers and generate more income. And I would tell you in the two sessions that we did it was standing room only with folks knocking on the door after they got their questions answered to figure out how to participate on joining the other platform. In terms of customer insights and learnings, we ran over 50 tests in the last six months both in terms of really getting the product market set thinking through, go-to-market and pricing strategies. And we feel that we're really positioned for something that's very early in its journey going into busy season, helping customers get set up, providing help along the way when they need it. And in some cases doing it for them. So we're excited heading into busy seizing in January knowing that our primary focus is to learn. But so far both on the pro side and customer demand side, it's been exciting to watch. Yes. The primary focus that we have are our customers that have between 10 to 100 employees, but that's not --it's not a hard line. It really depends on the number of customers that they have. The number of invoices that they have to do. The number of accounts payables that they have, and just a scale in which they operate. And so far and our primary focus has been ensuring that we take care of our existing customers. Those that are ready to upgrade to a platform that can better serve them and perform for them. While we build our capabilities to also acquire new. So we've seen about a 75%, 25% mix, 75% existing customers upgrading and 25% new. And over time, we expect that to evolve a bit because we want to actually accelerate the acquisition of new customers that we have. As we've shared before, there's about 180,000 customers within QBO base that are a fit for QBO Advanced. And so our primary initial focus in the coming kind of year and 18 months as our existing customers. But that's the mix we're seeing so far when new customers find out that we have the capability. They're just naturally coming over to the platform. It's all the above. Our teams have worked really hard this year in context of enabling us to expand our lead in doing yourself category, enabling us to transform the assisted category and going beyond tax and finding ways to provide benefits beyond tax. And so really the focus areas has been self employed. It's been Latinx. It's been improving our experiences for those that have that investments and stocks allow at the same time making sure help is available through TurboTax Live for all the cohorts. So really what we've learned in the last couple of years is all customers seek help from day one. And so we're ready to provide that both through if you want to do it yourself or through live. Well at the end of the tax experience helping you understand that there's ways to save money. There's ways to connect to financial products that are right for you to get out of debt over time. So we're really ready on all those fronts from day one because what we've learned is customers have those needs from day one when tax season opens up. Sure. First of all, important reminder that we're very early in our journey with QuickBooks Live. Literally, we just went GA and use QuickBooks Connect to activate it and we're excited about what more we can learn. So it's very early in the journey. There are a lot of similarities to TurboTax Live and the similarities are because of customer behaviors. The largest problem our customers face whether it's a consumer or a small business is confidence. It's confidence whether or not they're making good business decisions. Whether they need access to capital? Whether they're going to be able to make their payroll this coming week? How to think about profitability for their customer?  So it's really a confidence problem and the confidence question that they have, which means that this will apply to a cohort and a portion of our existing base, plus it's really an opportunity to penetrate non-consumption. A lot of customers that sit on the sidelines and use Google sheets and Excel and then just use a pro to help them run their business. This becomes the potential trigger for them to switch. And we're seeing all of that. We're seeing existing customers opts for help. And we're seeing new customers that are come in opting for either getting set up or engaging for help along the way because they need advice. So thus far we're seeing it across the spectrum. We really have not accounted for this to be a material impact for our revenue in this coming year. Again, we are --this is we are early in the journey, but this is one of the company's five big bets and we believe that it's a huge customer problem, and a big growth driver for the company in the future. Yes. I am extremely proud of our team. Five years ago, we weren't even on the map in the UK and they set a goal to maniacally focus on customers getting to product market fit, and when we do making sure that we really execute against our go-to-market strategies and raise awareness. And I would say, it's their hard work and focusing on product market fits. It's gotten us to the number one position because making taxes digital has been an opportunity for everyone. But our team has really done an incredible job nailing the product experience. Of course, we always have room to improve and really accelerating marketing investments and now our expectations are to really hold that number-one position to continue the growth. Yes, thank you for your question. Our choices and investments are really focused on our beliefs around what we can execute against and really grow the category and grow share. It has not anything to do with any choices that H&R Block has made. And I mean I can't comment on the choices that we've -- that they've made, but I have a lot of confidence in the choices that we've made and our focus as we head into see them. Yes. So, in terms of what's available in the UK, it is our QBO platform and we have app partners that solve some of the most pressing problems for our customers. The primary problems around payment employees like payroll and payments is all through partners. So we do solve those very important problems, but they're all through partners. Our intent is ultimately to roll out QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live in the UK and beyond. There are critical opportunities to solve customer problems and they're drivers of growth for the future. So we're -- we've been very deliberate about getting the product market fit in the US while the platform is global-ready in building the capabilities to roll this out globally and UK and then Canada will be the first stops. Sure, sure. Well, first of all, just as a -- if I could remind all of us that, outside the US we're in UK, Canada and Australia where we've gotten the product market fit and then there are emerging markets that we're focused on which is France, Brazil and India. And we are excited about the UK, but we are very hungry because I think we just think we're getting started in the UK, especially to solve customer problems in a way that will drive revenue growth. Our focus has been growing our customer base and growing share and now it's about accelerating to build a big business over time. So that's from just -- if I could paint a picture of where we are in the UK, I would just say, we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity ahead. And I would say we're in the same place in Canada. The growth in Canada, based on just the market dynamics is a bit slower, but the same opportunities still exist in Canada. And so, those are two markets where we believe that there is an opportunity for, over time, contribution to revenue growth. In terms of the emerging markets, the two that we are continuing to see progress, it's not yet material from the lens of how much it contributes, but we're excited about is France and Brazil. We're seeing really good traction in France. We're seeing good traction in Brazil. Those are markets that are very different, but the opportunities are, in the long term, ones that we like. And India is one that we continue to focus on product market fit. We have not made the progress that we would want to see us ourselves make in India and we're really still searching for product market fit. there, but when I look at UK, Canada, Australia, France and Brazil, I just view that we have good opportunities outside of the US and it's sufficient and we're being very intentional and deliberate in India in terms of the deliverables and what we're focused on to see if we can get the product market fit. Yes. So one of -- as you suggested, one of our bets is about being the center of small business growth. And one element of that is to be really be able to transform omni-channel commerce. And our focus, first and foremost, we do have a roadmap of what problems we want to solve and when, and the first set of deliverables are really about enabling customers to see all their orders in one place. So if they sell on Etsy, if they sell on Amazon and then if there is orders coming in from their own website, one of the biggest challenges that they had is actually seeing everything in one place and then eventually understanding their profitability in having a tighter inventory. So the first step in terms of what our teams are focused on is delivering that on the road map and we've not yet delivered it. But we're excited about the clarity that we have in terms of what we need to do for customers and then a road map that we've got the right team behind. So we'll certainly, on a quarterly basis, provide an update to you all, but we're excited about the progress that the team is making. Yes. Our principles really are clear in terms of what guide decisions that we make. First and foremost, it's about what's most important to our customers. The second is actually being able to solve that extremely well. And then the third is really assessing whether it's core versus context and how critical it is to the masses. And if its core, like TSheets is a great example of -- although we were partners with TSheets, what we learned and found out over time is that time tracking is very core to us. And the reason it's core to us is that it's a big input into automating the data that we get and therefore how we leverage the data applying artificial intelligence to it to really deliver more innovation for our customers. And so those are the principles and then drive whether it's partnership versus acquisition. It's less about just monetization. Of course, monetization matters over time. But first and foremost, it's about customer problem, can we solve it well and is it core versus context and then we let that drive whether it's a potential build acquisition or if it's a partnership. Sure, absolutely. If I could start with broader context. The whole purpose of QuickBooks Connect, which is something we started about five years ago was really to bring the ecosystem together. It's the ecosystem of our partners, our customers, our employees and really leveraging it as a launching pad from new innovation for training for our customers actually providing best practices in terms of how do you grow your firm, how do you go your practice, how do you grow your business. And it's something now that we stream outside of the 5,000 folks that attended, really, as a platform to launch big innovation, teach how to grow your business and it's a huge opportunity for us to learn. And so, at QuickBooks Connect there was a number of things that we launched, whether it's the line-up for payroll and some of the new innovations around auto pay, integrations to TSheets or cash flow planning where a small business can now understand their cash flow issues, plan for their cash flow so that they can make better decisions, which is the number one reason why small businesses go out of business, to many innovations and launches on the accountant platforms, how the accountants do a better job running their business and running their firm. So I wanted to start with a broader context of those many aspects of, and in many areas across the platform where we shared new innovations across the board. Specifically on QuickBooks Live, although we ran 50 tests over the last six months and have been in market and learning along with making sure that accountants are aware of our narrative of what we're trying to do here, we really use QuickBooks Connect as an activation platform. And I would tell you that once we got through these two standing room only sessions, there was incredible excitement about being part of the platform, because ultimately, they have the ability to grow their income, grow their practice and serve customers and do something that they don't like, which is marketing. We also addressed concerns because if you are not aware of the narrative as an accountant, you have a natural concern, which is, is Intuit trying to compete with me and is Intuit trying to take business away from me? We believe, by the way, that will always be a concern that will be out there until we get our narrative to every single pro and enrolled agent and accountant that's out there. And so we were excited about QuickBooks Connect because we were able to address some of those questions, some of those concerns face to face. And we had, by the way, well over 1,000 folks that wanted to sign up on the platform after those events, which, by the way, blew us away. We did not have those high of expectation. So net-net, this is a two-sided problem. The most important of solving the problem for small businesses and solving the problem for pros, which is helping them grow their practice. And we feel good about what we're learning. We feel good about our progress and QuickBooks Connect was a great activation event. Well, let me start with, we are still very early in the journey of TurboTax Live. As we've talked about before, there are 86 million folks that go to someone else to have them do their taxes for them. It's a $20 billion opportunity and we just got started a couple of years ago. And so our number one focus is customer growth and we're very focused this year on first time use additional access points so that you can get access to experts and improving the experience for experts. We do expect to increase the number of pros because now we're actually -- it's both for QuickBooks Live and our TurboTax Live. And actually that's where being a platform and leading this in a digital way really comes into play because it's about having experts for both platforms. But we do expect it to grow it. We do not expect to grow it in any way, shape or form as fast as our revenue will grow, but being very intentional to ensure that we have enough people to serve our customers. And I think I would just remind us that this is a technology-driven expert platform, which means that we're really applying AI to efficiently and effectively deliver experiences for our customers and that we do not see this as a impact on margin at all this year or beyond. We have not included any expectations of that sort in our guidance, nor do we expect that just from an execution perspective, but, of course, we're ready for our customers. Yes. So when we think about desktop in the long term, first and foremost, we are obsessively focused on delivering for our desktop customers while educating them on the benefits of the cloud, because they can -- over time, they can run their business in a much more effective way on the cloud, but what's important and what we've learned from our own experience is educating them on the benefits of the cloud and also educating them in terms of what's different on a cloud platform versus a desktop platform is very important because our desktop customers, whether TurboTax our QuickBooks, they love their desktop. So that's point number one. We do expect that this is a business that will decline over time. What's really kept it at the level that it's been at, has been our enterprise desktop business that's been growing double digits, but we don't -- we -- the expectations that we've shared on desktop with you all, still stand. In terms of QuickBooks Live, it certainly could be a potential catalyst. We have no proof at this point that it is, because we're really focused on our online customers. The real catalyst will be educating our desktop customers as to the benefits of online and making sure that they're prepared to make that jump. And I think we will just see a natural migration as we've seen over the last several years and QuickBooks Live could play a role. At this point, we don't have proof that it will and the biggest opportunity is really with non-consumption and current customers. Was your question on QuickBooks Live? Got it. Sorry. You cut out on me. I would say the biggest surprise that we've had is the very number of needs that the customers have. There are customers that will come in and just say, hey, here's all of my stuff from Word, from Excel, from Google Sheets, all the receipt boxes that I have. Can you just help me get set up. So I know what's going on in my business with QuickBooks and help me understand how to then run QuickBooks. So that -- the whole notion of set up, has been a huge need for customers and then the other is actually just advice. This is my cash flow, this is my net income, now that I understand it, what choices can I make? When will I need access to capital? Is it worth for me to take out capital? Should I buy more inventory? I've sat multiple times in different sessions listening to calls between our bookkeepers and small businesses, and just the amount of reliance and need that they have to understand what's going on in their business, what choices that they have. Intellectually, we all understand it, but when you really listen to these calls you get how important advice is, how important expertise is, and how much they lack confidence. And so, that's not a surprise, but just when you listen to these calls, they just amplifies how important it is. But I would say this whole notion of getting set up and understanding what's going on in my business and how blind that they are, and what's happening has been probably the biggest surprise and the biggest need that we're looking to figure out how to solve. Yes. We use -- first of all, I'll step back and reiterate how the ecosystem works together and what we're excited about is the notion of a customer being on our platform to get organized, to be able to invoice and get paid, to be able to pay their employees and with Cash Flow Planner, actually we can now give customers insight as to whether or not they even need access to a loan, but the loan is not the only way to solve their problem. It's also, do you want -- you want us to follow up with some of your customers that are overdue to get paid, you want to slow down paying a few vendors so you can make your payroll Friday. So, the Cash Flow Planner is really to help them thrive, to help them make better decisions because they're lonely and running their business. They don't have business partners to give them analytics and Cash Flow Planner is really -- is just going to be the beginning of something that will be their -- kind of their assistant in their pocket, if I may, to then offer ways for them to run their business, access to capital could be one. The second element to get to your question, there are two ways that we provide capital. One is the marketplace. One is through our own capital where we are partnered with a blue-chip financial firm where they had no recourse, but we also have provided access in that way. And based on the growth that we see, we continue to both leverage our blue-chip partner and the marketplace. And it's all really driven by the demand that we see both on our online platform and our desktop platform. So, it's an important retention driver. Over time it could be a growth driver, but most importantly what it's doing is helping our customers thrive and be able to get through the tougher earlier years to be able to survive as a business and improve their success rate. Sure. Yes. I'll start at the top, which is, there is about 1.5 million customers in the mid-market and we define mid-market as 10 to about 100 employees and it's about a $40 billion market based on the math that we've done when you include services. And when we think about our go-to-market, our initial focus is our existing customers. We have about 180,000 QBO customers that outgrow QBO. And ultimately, they need a platform that can perform at a different level that has rules and permissions, that has integrations with CRMs that meet their needs, just as an illustrative example. And so our go-to-market is really making sure our existing customers are aware of the platform, and right now, we're actually seeing a 75% of our growth coming from existing customers and about 25% of the customers are new. Eventually over time, we are right now building the capability, we're studying the best practices externally of those that have served the mid-market very well, putting together a great talented team that knows how to serve the mid-market and then ultimately, our plan is to raise awareness top of the funnel and pursue these mid-market customers that typically by the way, are still running their business on Excel, on Google Sheets are stretched in, use multiple accountants and so we foresee the combination of QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live working very well together. In fact, a certain percentage of our current QuickBooks Live customers are QuickBooks Advanced customers. And so, when you think about our bets, one connecting people to experts and then the second is disrupting in the mid-market, they actually play very well together hand-in-hand. And what we've learned seen so far is a lot of delight from our existing customers where they see that this platform can meet their needs. Over time, it can be a source of reason for migration from desktop to QuickBooks Advanced. But right now, our main focus is existing QBO customers. Yes, for sure. So France is really where the US was about 15 to 20 years ago. There is already a financial management solutions category, primarily on desktop. Most accountants are on desktop and light desktop, but now we're seeing small businesses want to use the cloud, because they see that it's far better to be able to use a cloud platform to be able to run their business. And they are now engaging accountants to be able to pull accountants to be able to come to the cloud so they can, in essence, help them run their business on the cloud. And that's really where the US was 15 to 20 years ago. And our team has done really a wonderful job of getting the product market fit by blocks. And what I mean by that is, we're focused on a street in Paris and making sure that we nail the experiences for that street in Paris and then go to the second street in Paris. And now we're starting to expand across Paris because the fastest way to get the product market fit is one customer at a time. And so we're seeing a nice acceleration. And we foresee, given our progress that France could be interesting and material three to five years from now. And again, it's where the US was about 15 years ago. Brazil had a large compliance marketplace; it's mainly an account marketplace. Brazil is a market where they rely heavily on services. And so the likes of QuickBooks Live, if I could use that as an example, is a natural thing that they would actually go to, which is they would love for an accountant to do all their business taxes for them and to be able to provide advice for them. And so those are some of the tests that we are now running in Brazil, which is shifting more toward services because that's what the market is oriented toward. So very different marketplaces in very different place. And I like the progress of our team. But again, these are more -- think about these opportunities three, five years out from now, don't look at them as near-term opportunities. Yes. Thank you very much for your questions and we look forward to chatting with you at our next earnings call. Have a great rest of the day and great rest of the week. Bye-bye."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Message]. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins.\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There is a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter capping off an outstanding year. Full-year revenue grew 25%, including the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by 16% growth for the small business in the Self-Employed Group and 14% growth for the Consumer Group. While Credit Karma had a very strong year, delivering another record quarter in Q4. Combined platform revenue, which includes QuickBooks Online, TurboTax Online, and Credit Karma grew 39% to 6.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes 18 points from the addition of Credit Karma.  I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this year and our game plan to win remains durable. Let me now turn over to tax. This year marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. We've built a durable strategy and we've made outstanding progress this year, with customer growth of 6% and our share of total returns up approximately 1 point. We extended our lead into the Do-It-Yourself category by focusing on underpenetrated segments, including investor customers, where we tripled the growth rate from last year. We continue to transform the $20 billion assisted segment with TurboTax Live, accelerating total customer growth by nearly 100%.  We have a highly predictable model and a platform with a significant runway for growth as we accelerate innovation. Recently, we announced plans not to renew our participation in the IRS refile program. We expect no impact on revenue from this decision. I want to make sure that you understand how this decision fits within our overall strategy. Free offerings are a critical part of our strategy to serve and grow with customers over time, offering benefits to power their prosperity. Intuit has delivered nearly 100 million free tax filings over the past eight years. And with nearly 90% of those free tax filings coming outside of the IRS refile program.  Looking ahead with no IRS refile program constraints, customers can enjoy all of the innovation we have to offer on our TurboTax, Credit Karma, and Mint platform. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 big bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the Company. These big bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these big bets are; revolutionize speed to benefit, connects people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.  Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these big bets and will provide a detailed update on all 5 big bets at Investor Day next month. Our second big bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers who have previously relied on in-person assistance, the opportunity to access tax experts to help them do their taxes or complete their returns digitally.  This expertise provides confidence for consumers and creates the halo effect for our entire TurboTax experience. The TurboTax Live funnel was strong this season. Customer awareness grew over 20% and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit grew more than 100%. Our full-service Do-It-For-Me offering attracted new customers from the assisted segment at a rate nearly 25% higher than our TurboTax Live Do-It - With -Me offering. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions with Credit Karma's data platform, and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets, and access financial expertise and advice.  To deliver on this goal, all -- our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans, and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts. Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved another record high revenue quarter in Q4 with the number of members reaching a new all-time high, fueled partly by the TurboTax integration and monthly active users, and frequency of member visits remained strong.  Within the core, credit card and personal revenue achieved another record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in transactions per member. The growth verticals also achieved an all-time revenue high, again, this quarter, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money part of our digital money offering. Just this past month or just this month, we announced the integration of QuickBooks Online payroll to deliver a better checking experience for a portion of our Small Business employees that help them manage all aspects of their financials, all in one place.  These results are evidence that successful innovation drives Credit Karma members to the platform, creating more opportunities to connect them with products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. The all-time highs we achieved are driven by focused innovation in both bolstering our proprietary AI-powered Lightbox technology and investing in growth verticals, such as home and auto, as well as pent-up demand from our partners. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to present offers to the members who have a higher likelihood of approval.  Partners usage of Lightbox in Q4 is now at an all-time high with over 50% of credit cards and over 40% of personal loan transactions flowing through, versus less than 40% and 20% a year ago. This is the power of a network effect, solving a two-sided problem. We expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper this coming year after a very strong year of investments by our partners, returning to pre-COVID investment levels. I'm very pleased with our progress and excited about the upcoming innovations. I'll end my circling back to our first big bet, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customers' pockets, eliminate friction, and deliver confidence at every touchpoint by using AI and customer insights.  This year, we accelerated our use of AI, increasing the number of models deployed across our platform by nearly 50%, saving our customers millions of hours of work. Our application of AI has dramatically increased the number of experiments we ran by more than 35% this year, made it easier for our TurboTax customers to never enter data, saving them millions of hours of manual entry and monetize our payroll offering, tripling release velocity.  We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plans to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our big bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. We will continue to invest aggressively, including in key talent to drive even faster innovation going forward. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion. GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 versus $1.68 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.97 versus a $1.81 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the small business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 19% during the quarter and 16% in fiscal 2021. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter, and 26% for the year.  With the aim of being the source of trade for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and Self-Employed is three-fold. Grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q4, driven mainly by customer growth, mix shift, and higher effective prices. Second, we continued to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking, and capital, grew 35% in fiscal Q4.  Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. During the quarter, we continued migrating customers to our new full-service lineup, which added approximately 5 points to online services growth. We're also seeing the number of employees per customer back to pre-pandemic levels. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4.  Total international online revenue grew 47% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single-digits in fiscal 2021. Consumer Group revenue grew 14% in fiscal 2021 above the high end of our longer-term expectation of 8% to 12%.  Fiscal 2021 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth for the Consumer Group. TurboTax units grew 6% this season. There are 4 primary drivers in our consumer business. Note that these metrics exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects the season through July 31, 2021, versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we estimate will be up approximately 3% this season, higher than our prior estimate of up, approximately 1%. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using Do-It-Yourself software.  We estimate the DIY category share of total IRS returns was down slightly this season, versus our prior estimate of approximately flat. The third driver is our share. Our share of total tax returns expanded, approximately 1 point to 31% this season, and our share of the DIY category grew approximately 1 point. Our total share excluding free fall customers this season was approximately 29%. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shifts to our premier offering, which is used by investors.  We estimate our retention rate rose slightly year-over-year, excluding filers seeking stimulus payments last season that didn't return again this season, and we're pleased with these results. Including these filers, we estimate total retention was down approximately 2 points. Turning to the ProConnect Group, we reported $517 million of revenue in fiscal 2021, up 5%. Moving onto Credit Karma, revenue was $405 million in Q4, another all-time high reflecting record highs for both the core and growth verticals. Sequential growth predominantly reflects strength in credit cards and personal loans as transactions per member increased. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in Fiscal 2022, after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this platform.  Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment.  Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash investments from our balance sheet. We repurchased $467 million of stock during the fourth quarter and a billion dollars during fiscal 2021. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving us a total authorization of approximately $3.3 billion to repurchase shares.  Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable on October 18th, 2021. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, our full-year fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $11.05 billion to $11.2 billion, growth of 15% to 16%, including a full-year of Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $7.46 to $7.66 and non - GAAP earnings per share of $11.05 to $11.25. We expect the GAAP tax rate of 20% in fiscal 2022. Note that our revenue guidance for Credit Karma of $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion translates into 18% to 21% growth if we had a full year of Credit Karma revenue during fiscal 2021. I'd like to provide some additional context around our operating margin expectations. As I've shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. However, our guidance implied GAAP operating margin declined just over 2 points in fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021. This reflects the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we're making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent.  We are confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance implies operating margin in fiscal 2022 expands approximately 60 basis points. As I shared last quarter, fiscal 2021 was a very unique year, as we took a conservative approach to investments during the first half of the year when we were deep in the pandemic, and then the business started to bounce back more quickly than we anticipated in the second half. Our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP operating margin implies on average, a point of expansion each year since fiscal 2019.  Even though our initial guidance after closing the Credit Karma acquisition included a negative 2-point non-GAAP operating margin impact. We continue to see margin expansion opportunities ahead. Our Q1 fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue growth of 36% to 38% GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $0.99. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Super. Thank you, Michelle. I'm proud of the team and always accomplished together and I'm optimistic about the future. We have a large, addressable market with digital and tailwinds that include a shift to Virtual Solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. With our strategy of becoming an AI-driven expert platform and five Big Bet s, we are positioned well for accelerated innovation and growth. Let's now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on a great fiscal year. Sasan, in the press release, you guys called out sort of online payments and payroll as 2 really important growth factors for small businesses. I was wondering if you could just unpack this a little bit more. What are you seeing there and how sustainable do you think those trends are around those 2 parts of the offering? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, Kirk. And good to hear from you. I will just take us back to several years ago when we talked about the importance of having a platform that really allows our customers to not only grow their business but to be able to manage their money and ensure that they are compliant.  And we've been heavily investing in payments, making it very easy for our customers to discover, making sure that we provide them with choice, accelerating our innovation in areas like instant deposit, getting paid upfront, those sorts of things.  And we -- that along with our investments in payroll, similar areas where we've really focused on making the experience far better, innovating in things like same-day payroll or next-day payroll, the shift of full-service where we have experts to help run your payroll and help you with your taxes, those are just of course two, very big and important illustrative examples where those innovations are really continuing to accelerate and beginning to pay off, especially in a time where we have digital tailwinds, where you have customers that are looking to move online, do more of their stuff online if they're already online.  And that is starting to pan out when you look at our overall services revenue, whether it's payroll, payments, time tracking, all of those areas are contributing. And I think to your question, yes, this is sustainable. We are continuing to become that platform that customers look to, to be able to run their business. Our innovations are starting to pay off and we're not standing still.  Our innovations are in fact accelerating, and we would continue to expect that we'll be there for our customers and grow with them. And I think the last thing I would say, especially with our move into the mid-market where we're starting to serve larger customers, those are larger transactions and as we continue to penetrate non-consumption in the mid-market, we would continue to see that pay off.\nKirk Materne: That's great. Maybe just one follow-up for Michelle on just the Credit Karma guide. I realize you guys called out the fact that there's a bit of pent-up demand in the back half this year, your fiscal year. How should we think about that in terms of just the cadence of the growth over the course of the year? Obviously, it's a little bit lumpy given we don't have full sort of year-over-year comps yet, but I was just kind of curious how we should maybe think about either first-half-year versus second half or any color around that would be helpful. Thanks.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey, Kirk. Thanks for your question. Yes. We're pretty excited about Credit Karma as we continue to look forward. Q4 was just their all-time high for revenue. And so, we felt really good about that as we see strength in both credit cards and personal loans and transactions per member increasing.Yes, you're right. As you heard Sasan said, we did see some of the pent-up demand. We expect that will taper in Fiscal 2022, we had a pretty strong year of investment by our partners.  And so, we do expect that to return to more pre-COVID investment levels. As to how you might think about that across the year, there's not a whole lot of seasonality within CK. So, but we -- obviously, we haven't guided the individual quarters except for Q1. But we are pretty excited about what we see and we think there's still a lot of opportunity for Credit Karma next year.\nKirk Materne: Super. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question. And I echo the sentiments on the strong year. First, maybe just touching on the payroll. I think Michelle, you mentioned 5 points of growth contribution on the online services side. Should we think of this as a tough comp or would you say that we're still very early in driving adoption of full-service and we could potentially see this be additive longer-term?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't sure if that was for me or you.\nKen Wong: I think you or Sasan are more than qualified to answer that question.\nSasan Goodarzi: I'd be happy to chime in and Michelle, please don't hesitate to jump in as well. First of all, I would just take you back to our longer-term expectations is to deliver 30% online revenue growth. And there's always going to be put and takes relative to payments and payroll and accounting revenue.  So please let your, sort of, uber compass be 30% online revenue growth. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, as I was answering Kirk's question, we are seeing the impact of our innovations pay off, and more and more of our customers are migrating to full-service payroll. More of our customers are actually wanting to get started on full-service payroll because of these capabilities that it has.  And it comes with expertise to help them solve the very problem that frankly is the biggest problem that is unsaid and that is about confidence. So, we have a runway ahead of us. Ken when it comes to payroll and I would just say your compass should be 30% online revenue growth.\nKen Wong: Great. Got it. Fantastic. And then just a quick follow-up on the tax side. At a high level, any attempts to possibly share with some of the components of that 10% to 11% consumer growth is going to be coming from next year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Ken. And we'll, of course, unpack this to a more detailed level at our upcoming Investor Day. I would just tell you that I am delighted with our continued strategic progress and that will really feed into our future growth, which I think is the element of your question. When you think about our performance, I know I'm repeating some of the stats, but I think they're worth repeating.  One, we increased our total share of IRS returns by 1 point, the 2 areas that really matter most that we're focused on underpenetrated segments and transforming the assisted segments. We saw really superb results. Our overall investor volume tripled year-over-year. TurboTax Live awareness increased 20%. Our total customers grew 100%, our new customers to the franchise to TurboTax Live grew over 100%.  And with our full-service offering, it actually attracted new customers from the prior year assisted segment at a 25% higher rate than TurboTax Live Do-It-With-Me. And our retention rate stayed flat to a little bit up overall. So, when you look at all the key sort of metrics, knock on wood, it's very, very healthy and we expect that to inform next year's growth. And we do assume, by the way, that IRS returns are going to be about flattish next year.  So that's probably one important assumption that's worthwhile sharing. Though this is just a continuation as you've probably heard me say multiple times, we're on a 10-year plus run in these opportunity areas that we're focused on. And next year is just going to be another sort of important pivotal year in our quest to transform assisted and penetrated the underpenetrated segment.\nKen Wong: Fantastic work guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Alright. Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nKeith Weiss: Thanks. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and echo the congratulations. Really strong end to what was a pretty remarkable fiscal year for all the team at Intuit. I wanted to dig into the FY 22 guide a little bit, particularly around small businesses. Michelle, you've been talking about sort of a return to 30% plus growth in the Online Ecosystem side of the equation.  But if I'm doing my math right, and that's probably a big part of the equation here, if I could actually do the math. If I'm doing my math right, and we're growing online, 30% plus, that would imply with your guide that Desktop is actually now shrinking and down 10% in FY '22 or 10% plus.  Is something changing in Desktop or am I just doing my math wrong? Or sort of how should we think about that balance between sort of what had been a very durable sort of revenue stream in Desktop and a ramping online business?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey, Keith. Thanks for your question. Well, first of all, I'd say we've been really excited about how Small Business has performed this year. And obviously, you can see with next year with our guide of 12% to 14%, we feel that it will be strong next year also.  We feel that you really need to continue to look at Online Ecosystem revenue growth. And we do expect that to be 30% or better over time. We haven't guided to it. We don't do it quarterly, but we do expect it to be there over the long term and being driven by the 10% to 20% gross number of customers on the ARPC. Now when I go to the other side, which you were asking about around Desktop. Desktop, we have over time, the last few years, we've seen some growth in it, and obviously, this past year in 2021, we saw 4% growth. But we do anticipate that that will just continue to decline over time. We've got more and more customers. As they come in, they choose the online versions and so you've got 8, 9 out of 10 customers that come in and choose QBO. So that's where I would help you with your math on that.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And just to be clear, is there any kind of structural change in terms of trying to more aggressively shift people from the desktop version to the online version, or is this just sort of normal course business and this is the trend line that you've been seeing over time?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: We have -- we've chosen not to force people to move onto online. We do think that there is a much better value proposition, and they just have a much better experience if they're using our online products, but we want them to use whatever works for them. But we have seen more and more people as they choose Desktop, they are choosing the Plus product, where they have the subscription. And so that is part of what we've been seeing.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Excellent. Thank you so much, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I echo again all the congratulations that are in order. I wanted to start with just digging a little bit on Credit Karma since the growth is so much better than I think we've been modeling and anybody has really been thinking. I want to maybe unpack both in the quarter and also in the guidance, are you starting to see synergies that you're realizing whether it's monetizing you\u2019re -- the Intuit free user base with Credit Karma or whether it's cross-selling to the Karma base. And then I have a quick follow-up on the margins.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Alex. Great to hear from you. Thank you for your kind comments. On Credit Karma, let me just -- I'll briefly start at the top in terms of what we are seeing. First of all, the accelerated innovation that we are seeing with Credit Karma is really paying off, and that accelerated innovation is how we're using our combined data to be able to deliver personalized experiences, leveraging Lightbox for our customers.  It's then ensuring that we're providing relevant offers to customers in the areas that they need it most. And now we can provide multiple relevant offers, whether it's cards, personal loans, auto insurance, home loans, and beyond.  But I think then more important than when they -- the offers in front of them, we have the ability to actually help them with the potential of their approval and make it very easy when they click to actually get the offers. So those are all critical areas of innovation that are really paying off. And I think it's a testament to the platform that when our partners decided to really go after customer acquisition, that they invested a good chunk of their dollars on the platform. And it just demonstrates the network effect than the power of the data and the trust of the members that we have. So that's the first element that we just believe will continue given our accelerated innovation, because our -- ultimately, our penetration rate, maybe one of the highest in credit cards. But it's one of the lowest when you look at auto insurance. So, we have so much room for increased wallet share. In terms of synergies, Alex, we are actually quite bullish about the possibilities for the future.  And I would want you to think about those synergies in the future, and there are really several areas of synergy. One is really making Credit Karma benefits part of the entire TurboTax experience. That's one big opportunity. The other big opportunity is making it seamless and contextual, in terms of TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma experience to be able to do your taxes.  And then third, what we just announced, which is Credit Karma being part of the payroll experience where our payroll customers can actually deposit their monies into a free checking and savings account and be able to access their money early over time if they wish.  So those are significant opportunities because they're -- you're talking about millions and millions of TurboTax customers, payroll customers, and of course, over -- well over a 100 million Credit Karma customers that we're going to launch TurboTax to. This past year, and as I'll remind us, it feels like a long time, but we just closed Credit Karma in December. These past eight months, we have been experimenting with incredible purpose, incredible speed, and incredible intention. And it's informed what we are rolling out and what we're doing in the year to come. I would just say in terms of those things turning into material customer revenue growth, there -- we're not counting on that in the near-term, we're counting on that more on the mid-term because we want to really continue to nail the experience in creating ecosystem benefit across all of our members. So that's the way I would want you to think about not only what you're seeing in Credit Karma, but the growth rates that are ahead of us.\nAlex Zukin: That's super-clear. And I appreciate the level of detail in that answer, Sasan. Michelle, maybe for you, I know myself, I was dealing with a lot of questions around margin leverage potential on the guide and versus the level of investment that you guys clearly see as an opportunity in the business but I think you've delivered -- I think it was your best incremental operating margin leverage guide in the last few years, at least.  So, I want to unpack both what you're trying to tell us with the ability to deliver both growth and margin leverage at this scale. Unpack it if you can, from a gross margin versus OpEx savings perspective.  I know I remember a few years ago there was fear with lives, particularly coming into the model that it would be gross margin dilutive, and yet, the gross margin has actually improved this year. So, I want to understand a little bit about when you think about that incremental margin leverage, where is it coming from and how should we think about the durability of that opportunity?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Great question, Alex. Thank you. First of all, thank you for acknowledging the margin delivery we have this year. You mentioned gross margin and we have continued to say that we expect gross margin to remain fairly flat over time. You're right, we did have a lot of questions as we got into the TurboTax Live businesses as to whether that was going to deteriorate margins. But it has remained flattish over time. I mean, that was the last expectation we gave that I gave last year at Investor Day. And our big focus is obviously on margin, and we see the opportunity there and continue to see opportunities to drive margin leverage really as we become more and more of a platform Company. FY 21 was a little unique, in that with the pandemic and full swing at the beginning, we weren't exactly sure how -- exactly how things are going to play out and we were a little bit more conservative with investments. And then the business ended up bouncing back much more quickly than we thought.  So, as I mentioned earlier, when you look over all the way back from 2019, we've got about on average a point of margin expansion. And so, we feel really good about that, and especially with our guide looking forward to 60 basis points.  So, when I think about where we'll see the expansion, though it is really all across the business is helping us drive it, getting leverage, whether it's in technology, and looking at how we can get rid of duplicate technology and use services more, whether it's in customer success and really leaning into a platform there to deliver for all our customers or opportunities we have in our go-to-market and enabling additional technology there. So, we do think that we continue to have opportunities to drive that leverage.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Great job.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies, your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Sasan, if you could expand on the Small Business side and what you're seeing on the international approach and the traction beyond the U.S. and how critical that is to this next year for you. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Michelle on QuickBooks Live, if you can give us an update in terms of traction and any trend lines you're seeing there. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Brent, just a follow-up question. The last question that you asked about trend lines, were those just general trend lines that we're seeing in small businesses? I want to make sure we captured your question correctly.\nBrent Thill: More specifically the QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Live. My apologies, QuickBooks Live.\nSasan Goodarzi: Got it. Okay. Great. So, let me start with your question about the international. First of all, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, and I think the same trend continues. One thing that's unchanged is small businesses across the globe are still recovering. Some have recovered to -- back to pre-COVID levels. Some have actually accelerated their business because they changed the model. But at least what we see in our data, 20% ish of small businesses are still struggling. And struggling is defined by, they have -- their net deposits are down over 25%. So, I think it's important just as a general perspective to recognize that small businesses are in general still in recovery mode. With that said, our platform has become more critical than ever. And the digital nature of our platform to be able to run your business, grow your business, manage your cash flow, and be compliant is more important than ever, which is why, based on our innovation, overall, we're seeing this acceleration.  And then if I put that in the context of geography, I would say the U.S. has really bounced back in terms of the usage of our platform and, in fact, an acceleration probably above all, it's happened in the U.S. I would say Canada is sort of next in terms of recovery. And I would just put countries like the UK, France, Australia as really being much, much slower in the recovery. And really the reason is as you've seen, there's a lot of open, shutdown, open, shutdown and that's really impacted just a sentiment of both accountants and small businesses. But even in that context, it's actually quite exciting that we delivered 47% revenue growth in constant currency last quarter and 43% for the whole year. But with that said, we're assuming a much slower recovery international than we are in the U.S. because I think it's just really important that we get out of this health crisis. And then once we do, we believe the small businesses will bounce back much, much faster outside the U.S. International is still important for our future, but what I just shared is just how we've taken that into account strategically in both economically and our guidance as we look ahead. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Michele to answer your QuickBooks Live question.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Great. Hey, Brent, I would say we're continuing to make some progress with QuickBooks Live. It actually goes back to what I mentioned earlier on, the opportunities for platform leverage because it's actually built on the same platform as TurboTax Live. And that's what enabled us to bring it to market so much more quickly.  Right now, we're still focused on achieving product-market fit. Seeing some early signs here is a way to bring in customers who are new to Intuit, to help us with customer acquisition.  And we do think that there is a great opportunity for us to use the live product, to help penetrate non-consumption, which as you know, is a huge opportunity. The pandemic over this last year has really been an opportunity as we've seen the acceleration to a virtual world. And so, obviously, customers are much more anxious to or much more open to using these types of experiences. And so, our platform really enables that. It does solve one of the biggest problems we have with Small Business customers, which is confidence. You also see that on the TurboTax side too. Expert interest has continued to remain really strong. And so that has been a good thing for us to see.  A few customer pains point we're currently working on are on solving, streamlining, and automating document collection. And then enabling messaging within the offerings so customers can more easily communicate with their bookkeeper. And then the last thing I'd say is last year we launched the setup queue so that we could really help small businesses come in, get set up on QuickBooks, and have that confidence right from the get-go. And we've seen some good success with that.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations on an exciting finish to the fiscal year. Sasan, I wanted to get your thoughts on the Small Business ecosystem, as you look at the business, a few years out, and it looks like, clearly, the Company is having increasing success with payroll and payments. But I'm curious with the added juice with the small businesses perpetually underspent on IT, but that could be changing with digital transformation.  So, as you move slightly upmarket and Small Businesses and land bigger deals with QuickBooks Advanced. What are the things that you're learning about that part of the market that shoots into it particularly well, given that you got a wide range of assets, AI, Credit Karma et cetera? So how do you bring those assets to bear in a way that you can get a big chunk of the IT spending that is -- that could potentially be unleashed into the higher end, as you move upmarket in the small business ecosystem? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great question, Kash. And great to hear from you. I'll take you back to the bet that we have declared, which is we truly want to be the center of Small Business growth. And for us, it's really about helping customers grow their business.  It's helping our customers manage all of their money flow, and it's also ensuring that they can take good care of their employees and be compliant. And I think particularly, there are two areas to answer your question as we move upmarket, but it's also relevant.  One of them is very relevant to just smaller businesses that we're continuing to focus on. And that is one, how do we help you grow your business? That's both relevant to the businesses that we serve today, but also very relevant to the mid-market customers and so to be able to manage your marketing, your sales, your services, is one element. I think the other element, which is particularly important for mid-market customers is just all their GNA.  And we believe that the live platform that we've created, the engines that we've created will actually help us go beyond bookkeeping, taxes, and accounting to be able to focus on some of their -- and how they run their business and particularly the live GNA. So those are the two areas.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you so much. Congrats.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question and I will say my congratulations for a great end to this challenging year. Sasan, I want to ask you about a follow-up on your TurboTax, mainly TurboTax Live full-service. This is the first-year you guys launched. So, I'm wondering, what have you learned this year? And hopefully next season, maybe we'll go back to normalcy so what's your expectation back into guidance in terms of adoption of full-service?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hi, Siti. And thank you for your kind words. I would just start with really, this has been a very intentional multiyear effort to have one platform across TurboTax, where you can do your taxes yourself. You can get assistance to do your taxes or we'll do your taxes for you. And a platform where you can choose to go back and forth within the year or in a multiyear period, we want to be the platform for your taxes and of course, obviously beyond that, with the capabilities that we have with Credit Karma.  The second element, I would say is what we learned this year, going to full launch, is that full-service offering has a halo effect and build confidence for customers, which is why we were able to attract new customers from the prior assisted method at a 25% higher rate into full-service because they know that they can digitally provide us all of their data. And we have excellent experts to be able to take very good care of them. So that's the biggest learning that we had.  It was a hypothesis that we have from prior-year experimentation and we're going to continue to scale that as we look ahead. It's just a very critical part of our platform. And as I've said before, we believe that we're in the very, very early innings of a 10-year plus opportunity here. And we just see full-service playing a very important role as we look ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: That's great. Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Congratulations from me too. 2 tax questions. The first one, Sasan, if you could, I guess, use this opportunity to describe a little bit more the decision process to exit Free File Alliance, and then I think you and Michelle mentioned, should not have a revenue impact. I'm just curious, any thoughts on margin impact for the go-forward? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Thank you. Scott, good to hear from you. First of all, just as a reminder, we were one of the founding members of the Free File Alliance program with the IRS and it has been frankly, an incredible partnership with the IRS and the private industry. And when we really founded this program with the IRS, there were really two goals. And I'll simplify it. The two goals were, we wanted at that time, to ensure that electronic filing was used by more than 80% plus of all consumers. And we wanted to make sure that free filing was available to 80% plus of consumers. And when you forward the clock, mission accomplished on both, in fact, we've exceeded both metrics as an industry on both fronts. And Free has now become prevalent across the entire industry. And so, we felt that the time was right now that the mission has been accomplished to really change our approach to how we can deliver benefits for customers. Free will always be an important part of the strategy, but there are constraints when you come in through the Free File Alliance program and those constraints are, for instance, we can't provide you benefits on other platforms, like our free Credit Karma platform.  And so, as we look ahead, not only will we be able to provide free tax offerings to our customers, but as they grow and we grow with them, they can benefit from Credit Karma, they can benefit from Mint. If they are a small business, they can benefit from QuickBooks, things that we ultimately couldn't talk to them about if they were part of the Free File Alliance program. So, mission accomplished and that's the reason why we chose to get out. I just want to state again, the partnership with the IRS has absolutely been phenomenal and with private industry to achieve the goals of FFA.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks, and just any thoughts on the margin on the gulf [Indiscernible] --\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. My apologies, I failed to answer that. No impact to margins, no impact to revenue, and some of the resources actually were that -- were on FFA, we're reallocating them to really important work in TurboTax. So, there's no impact.\nScott Schneeberger: Understood. And just a real quick follow-up from an earlier question, you mentioned a flattish IRS industry growth anticipated for next year. Is that because we saw what looks like 3% this year in just the top comp or any other factors that go into that entry space. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott, I'll just start with it's an assumption, we make an assumption every year. So, what we think it will be because it's important for our planning. And because there have been two years of pretty strong total return growth, we're just assuming next year is going to be flat. We could be wrong, it could grow, but our assumption going in is it's flat.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Absolutely, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turin of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. And congrats on the strong results of the year. Going back to Credit Karma, I'm just wondering if there's anything you can add around how much visibility you have there in framing targets for the upcoming year relative to other segments of your business? I think the commentary is clear around the Q4 strength, but just wondering how to pass through the 18% to 21% growth you referenced, which is a solid starting point, and the guidance is modestly down relative to the run rate that segment just delivered. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Michael, and thank you for it. I know you've been waiting for a while in the queue here. We have very good visibility and I'll just be specific. We have well over 100 million customers. We see the monthly active users, which has grown quite nicely.  We actually, based on the data that we have and how we are leveraging that data with our customer's permission as part of Lightbox and the number of partners that come into Lightbox, we actually can see spend behavior. We can see our customer's activity.  We can see their financial situations and are continued to be better positioned to be able to offer them products that are right for them. So, when we see our member growth, when we see our member activity, the number of transactions, which is the number of offerings that we now have, the activity of our partners, which we're very engaged with because our partners see this platform as a great growth opportunity for them.  And the fact that we continue to be very intentional, that we are an agnostic platform. We have pretty good visibility into the future with Credit Karma. And we feel, of course, good and confident about the guidance that we provided.\nMichael Turrin: That's so helpful. Thanks for [Indiscernible]\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Sasan, I believe earlier in the call you talked about retention rates in TurboTax being flat year-over-year. What types of things have to happen to see that tick up?\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Brad. Good to hear from you. First of all, with all of the movement in the last couple of years with the pandemic and the growth that we've experienced, we're actually quite pleased with the retention rates. And I would tell you the biggest lever around retention is what we are doing with TurboTax Live, which is ensuring that our customers know and understand that there is an expert to help them every step of the way. But I think secondly, and we haven't talked much about this and we'll spend a little bit of time on this at Investor Day, is how we are now leveraging data to never lose the customer. And I give a lot of credit to our TurboTax team where we've been working on this for several years.  It's not a new body of work, but the shift from just engaging you once a year when it's tax time, to actually understanding and leveraging what we know about you. If something has changed in your life if you bought a house if you bought a car if you got married if you got divorced if you move from one state to another. It's actually engaging you year-round relative to giving your confidence that those changes can be addressed by us.  So, it's the combination of leveraging data, applying AI for that data with our models to understand who could be at risk, and then engaging those customers proactively. And by the way, depending on their needs, not just with TurboTax, it could also be engaging them with the benefits of Credit Karma. Those are the two big things, data, and AI, and the capabilities of TurboTax Live, engaging customers year-round, where we are quite confident over the long term, we can continue to increase our retention rates.\nBrad Reback: And then just one quick follow-up. High level, any sense of why DIY went backward this year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Brad, the numbers are so wonky. What happened the last couple of years, I think so many people that don't have to file their taxes came in to do their taxes to get a stimulus check. And so, what really matters are some of the underlying numbers that we provided, and the fact that we gained share overall, IRS returns and within DIY, even though DIY went down. But it's just a wonkiness of the number of stimulus customers that came in that ultimately didn't have to file their taxes again this year. So that's the reasoning as we look at all the cohorts.\nBrad Reback: Great, makes total sense. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right, Brad. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. The first one is on the Credit Karma site where you're expecting maybe to see some of the pent-up demand return to more normal levels. We're just curious whether that is more driven on the -- in the core markets or some of the emerging markets?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, Jackson. It's primarily originations in credit cards and personal loans. One data point is public, the other one is in our own data that we see. They're up double-digits strongly compared to pre-COVID levels. And we believe those are just going at some point taper. in the back half of the year, and it's primarily from what we see in credit cards and personal loans.  And it's really our innovation on the platform that will continue the guidance growth that we provided of 18% to 21%. But it's really in credit cards and personal loans that we believe originations will go back to pre - COVID levels, which were strong, it's just there was pent-up demand so it grew to double-digits.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Perfect. And then a follow-up, Michelle, the TurboTax Premier skew, I think is better than maybe you would be expected the entire year. Can you just remind us, what does Premier's retention rate look like relative to maybe the overall TurboTax platform?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey, Jackson, thanks for the question. Premier, we've done a good amount of work on Premier last couple of years. It's specifically used by our investors. And so obviously we've continued to see the growth that's one of the underpenetrated segments that we've focused on. We have not provided any detailed information on our retention rates below the higher level for TurboTax, so that's just not an area that we really delved into, just because of the competitive nature.\nJackson Ader: All right, fair enough. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Jackson.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks, guys. And I'll echo the congratulations on a real nice finish to the year. One of the things that stands out to me is the outlook for small businesses, very strong relative to kind of how you provide outlook heading into the year historically. So, my question is, is there a price increase in there and just more generally as you think longer term, historically, the Company has raised price commensurate with more value that's delivered in the product for QuickBooks, how do you feel about your ability to just monetize more of the market with just more value-added features coming over the long-term? What are some of those things that you think might enable you to take price over time? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Brad, for your question and your kind words. Let me make a couple of comments. One, the -- really are the majority of our growth is coming from customer growth and mix. And when I say mix, it's for instance, QuickBooks Advanced, which goes after the mid-market type mix. It's really not driven by price, although we have increased price this year and it's the first time, we've done it in over the last couple of years. And I'd tell you that we run tests and it's exactly as you said, it's -- we look at the price-value equation. We have very clear pricing principles. And with experimentation and data, we choose when to move forward with the price increase.  And I would tell you that our innovation, just in the last couple of years, literally last year, our innovation across the Company, which includes small business, doubled year-over-year in terms of -- and we measure that by code deployment and impact, and it's doubled again this year. And that shows up in how we leverage data and AI across the platform to deliver insights to customers. It shows up in payments and payroll and time tracking. And then what we've announced, which is moving upmarket several years ago with QuickBooks advance, it's being able to serve product-based businesses with QuickBooks commerce.  It's being able to go after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live, which is a higher sort of price tag for our customers. And then our disruptive offering with QuickBooks Cash, which is, in essence, you can start with a business bank account and be able to run your business through that. So just the innovation is I would just say staggering, focused on cohorts of customers and going after their needs, and with an open platform, we're able to really focus on what matters more to customers and monetize. So, we believe that capability is one that we'll have for years to come.\nBrad Sills: That's great. Thanks so much, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask one question on the Small Business segment, and specifically around some of the key metrics there, like gross to customer additions, charge volumes, employees, and under payroll, have you seen any change in some of those key metrics you track as COVID variants have started to impact various spots of the U.S. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Matt, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're continuing to see strength by industry, by geography, given some of the tailwinds and our innovation that I spoke about earlier. So, with the Delta variant being the primary driver of the COVID cases and what we're seeing in different states within the U.S. having a different impact, we've really not seen an impact in our results in charge volume, the number of employees, so the strength remains.\nMatt Pfau: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Millman: Thank you. So, a couple of questions. On this year's -- on next year's guidance or I guess, this year's guidance, is that lowest seeming number related to your conservatism on last year's guidance? And what should we expect over 2 years to the 3-year range? And secondly, on last year's -- or this current year's tax, to what extent did you have assisted benefit from people misunderstanding or concerned about the stimulus and wanting to sit down? And it was a one-year phenomenon. And we go back to reduced assisted and increasing Do-It-Yourself. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Michael, for your question. A couple of things. I'll start with your first question. We're very excited about the innovation across the Company. The customer segments we're pursuing, and the impact of that, that we are seeing. And in that context, we feel very good about our guidance and long-term expectations. This gets to the second question, and that is the long term, what we'll do at Investor Day, as we do every year, is we'll share our long-term expectations. So, we'll talk about that at Investor Day.  So, if you wouldn't mind maybe waiting another 3 weeks, we'll talk about that a little bit more. And the third part of your question around tax and assistance and do we have a blip from the pandemic, I would say the short answer is really no. This year, a lot of our -- a lot of accountants and stores were actually open.  I think what you're seeing here is just it's the impact of our innovation, it's raising the awareness that we have live expertise available for customers, whether we do it with you or do it for you. And in that context, this was not a blip because of the pandemic. If anything, most places were actually open and this was just based on our strategy and the results of our execution.\nMichael Millman: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you. Well, thank you very much for the wonderful questions and I want to just thank our employees, our customers, and our partners for another great quarter and I wish all of you to be safe out there and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating, and this concludes today's conference call.",

            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion. GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 versus $1.68 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.97 versus a $1.81 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the small business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 19% during the quarter and 16% in fiscal 2021. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter, and 26% for the year.  With the aim of being the source of trade for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and Self-Employed is three-fold. Grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q4, driven mainly by customer growth, mix shift, and higher effective prices. Second, we continued to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking, and capital, grew 35% in fiscal Q4.  Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. During the quarter, we continued migrating customers to our new full-service lineup, which added approximately 5 points to online services growth. We're also seeing the number of employees per customer back to pre-pandemic levels. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4.  Total international online revenue grew 47% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single-digits in fiscal 2021. Consumer Group revenue grew 14% in fiscal 2021 above the high end of our longer-term expectation of 8% to 12%.  Fiscal 2021 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth for the Consumer Group. TurboTax units grew 6% this season. There are 4 primary drivers in our consumer business. Note that these metrics exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects the season through July 31, 2021, versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we estimate will be up approximately 3% this season, higher than our prior estimate of up, approximately 1%. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using Do-It-Yourself software.  We estimate the DIY category share of total IRS returns was down slightly this season, versus our prior estimate of approximately flat. The third driver is our share. Our share of total tax returns expanded, approximately 1 point to 31% this season, and our share of the DIY category grew approximately 1 point. Our total share excluding free fall customers this season was approximately 29%. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shifts to our premier offering, which is used by investors.  We estimate our retention rate rose slightly year-over-year, excluding filers seeking stimulus payments last season that didn't return again this season, and we're pleased with these results. Including these filers, we estimate total retention was down approximately 2 points. Turning to the ProConnect Group, we reported $517 million of revenue in fiscal 2021, up 5%. Moving onto Credit Karma, revenue was $405 million in Q4, another all-time high reflecting record highs for both the core and growth verticals. Sequential growth predominantly reflects strength in credit cards and personal loans as transactions per member increased. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in Fiscal 2022, after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this platform.  Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment.  Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash investments from our balance sheet. We repurchased $467 million of stock during the fourth quarter and a billion dollars during fiscal 2021. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving us a total authorization of approximately $3.3 billion to repurchase shares.  Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable on October 18th, 2021. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, our full-year fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $11.05 billion to $11.2 billion, growth of 15% to 16%, including a full-year of Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $7.46 to $7.66 and non - GAAP earnings per share of $11.05 to $11.25. We expect the GAAP tax rate of 20% in fiscal 2022. Note that our revenue guidance for Credit Karma of $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion translates into 18% to 21% growth if we had a full year of Credit Karma revenue during fiscal 2021. I'd like to provide some additional context around our operating margin expectations. As I've shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. However, our guidance implied GAAP operating margin declined just over 2 points in fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021. This reflects the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we're making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent.  We are confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance implies operating margin in fiscal 2022 expands approximately 60 basis points. As I shared last quarter, fiscal 2021 was a very unique year, as we took a conservative approach to investments during the first half of the year when we were deep in the pandemic, and then the business started to bounce back more quickly than we anticipated in the second half. Our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP operating margin implies on average, a point of expansion each year since fiscal 2019.  Even though our initial guidance after closing the Credit Karma acquisition included a negative 2-point non-GAAP operating margin impact. We continue to see margin expansion opportunities ahead. Our Q1 fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue growth of 36% to 38% GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $0.99. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Hey, Kirk. Thanks for your question. Yes. We're pretty excited about Credit Karma as we continue to look forward. Q4 was just their all-time high for revenue. And so, we felt really good about that as we see strength in both credit cards and personal loans and transactions per member increasing.Yes, you're right. As you heard Sasan said, we did see some of the pent-up demand. We expect that will taper in Fiscal 2022, we had a pretty strong year of investment by our partners.  And so, we do expect that to return to more pre-COVID investment levels. As to how you might think about that across the year, there's not a whole lot of seasonality within CK. So, but we -- obviously, we haven't guided the individual quarters except for Q1. But we are pretty excited about what we see and we think there's still a lot of opportunity for Credit Karma next year. Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't sure if that was for me or you. Hey, Keith. Thanks for your question. Well, first of all, I'd say we've been really excited about how Small Business has performed this year. And obviously, you can see with next year with our guide of 12% to 14%, we feel that it will be strong next year also.  We feel that you really need to continue to look at Online Ecosystem revenue growth. And we do expect that to be 30% or better over time. We haven't guided to it. We don't do it quarterly, but we do expect it to be there over the long term and being driven by the 10% to 20% gross number of customers on the ARPC. Now when I go to the other side, which you were asking about around Desktop. Desktop, we have over time, the last few years, we've seen some growth in it, and obviously, this past year in 2021, we saw 4% growth. But we do anticipate that that will just continue to decline over time. We've got more and more customers. As they come in, they choose the online versions and so you've got 8, 9 out of 10 customers that come in and choose QBO. So that's where I would help you with your math on that. We have -- we've chosen not to force people to move onto online. We do think that there is a much better value proposition, and they just have a much better experience if they're using our online products, but we want them to use whatever works for them. But we have seen more and more people as they choose Desktop, they are choosing the Plus product, where they have the subscription. And so that is part of what we've been seeing. Great question, Alex. Thank you. First of all, thank you for acknowledging the margin delivery we have this year. You mentioned gross margin and we have continued to say that we expect gross margin to remain fairly flat over time. You're right, we did have a lot of questions as we got into the TurboTax Live businesses as to whether that was going to deteriorate margins. But it has remained flattish over time. I mean, that was the last expectation we gave that I gave last year at Investor Day. And our big focus is obviously on margin, and we see the opportunity there and continue to see opportunities to drive margin leverage really as we become more and more of a platform Company. FY 21 was a little unique, in that with the pandemic and full swing at the beginning, we weren't exactly sure how -- exactly how things are going to play out and we were a little bit more conservative with investments. And then the business ended up bouncing back much more quickly than we thought.  So, as I mentioned earlier, when you look over all the way back from 2019, we've got about on average a point of margin expansion. And so, we feel really good about that, and especially with our guide looking forward to 60 basis points.  So, when I think about where we'll see the expansion, though it is really all across the business is helping us drive it, getting leverage, whether it's in technology, and looking at how we can get rid of duplicate technology and use services more, whether it's in customer success and really leaning into a platform there to deliver for all our customers or opportunities we have in our go-to-market and enabling additional technology there. So, we do think that we continue to have opportunities to drive that leverage. Great. Hey, Brent, I would say we're continuing to make some progress with QuickBooks Live. It actually goes back to what I mentioned earlier on, the opportunities for platform leverage because it's actually built on the same platform as TurboTax Live. And that's what enabled us to bring it to market so much more quickly.  Right now, we're still focused on achieving product-market fit. Seeing some early signs here is a way to bring in customers who are new to Intuit, to help us with customer acquisition.  And we do think that there is a great opportunity for us to use the live product, to help penetrate non-consumption, which as you know, is a huge opportunity. The pandemic over this last year has really been an opportunity as we've seen the acceleration to a virtual world. And so, obviously, customers are much more anxious to or much more open to using these types of experiences. And so, our platform really enables that. It does solve one of the biggest problems we have with Small Business customers, which is confidence. You also see that on the TurboTax side too. Expert interest has continued to remain really strong. And so that has been a good thing for us to see.  A few customer pains point we're currently working on are on solving, streamlining, and automating document collection. And then enabling messaging within the offerings so customers can more easily communicate with their bookkeeper. And then the last thing I'd say is last year we launched the setup queue so that we could really help small businesses come in, get set up on QuickBooks, and have that confidence right from the get-go. And we've seen some good success with that. Hey, Jackson, thanks for the question. Premier, we've done a good amount of work on Premier last couple of years. It's specifically used by our investors. And so obviously we've continued to see the growth that's one of the underpenetrated segments that we've focused on. We have not provided any detailed information on our retention rates below the higher level for TurboTax, so that's just not an area that we really delved into, just because of the competitive nature."

            "content": "Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter capping off an outstanding year. Full-year revenue grew 25%, including the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by 16% growth for the small business in the Self-Employed Group and 14% growth for the Consumer Group. While Credit Karma had a very strong year, delivering another record quarter in Q4. Combined platform revenue, which includes QuickBooks Online, TurboTax Online, and Credit Karma grew 39% to 6.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes 18 points from the addition of Credit Karma.  I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this year and our game plan to win remains durable. Let me now turn over to tax. This year marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. We've built a durable strategy and we've made outstanding progress this year, with customer growth of 6% and our share of total returns up approximately 1 point. We extended our lead into the Do-It-Yourself category by focusing on underpenetrated segments, including investor customers, where we tripled the growth rate from last year. We continue to transform the $20 billion assisted segment with TurboTax Live, accelerating total customer growth by nearly 100%.  We have a highly predictable model and a platform with a significant runway for growth as we accelerate innovation. Recently, we announced plans not to renew our participation in the IRS refile program. We expect no impact on revenue from this decision. I want to make sure that you understand how this decision fits within our overall strategy. Free offerings are a critical part of our strategy to serve and grow with customers over time, offering benefits to power their prosperity. Intuit has delivered nearly 100 million free tax filings over the past eight years. And with nearly 90% of those free tax filings coming outside of the IRS refile program.  Looking ahead with no IRS refile program constraints, customers can enjoy all of the innovation we have to offer on our TurboTax, Credit Karma, and Mint platform. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 big bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the Company. These big bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these big bets are; revolutionize speed to benefit, connects people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.  Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these big bets and will provide a detailed update on all 5 big bets at Investor Day next month. Our second big bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers who have previously relied on in-person assistance, the opportunity to access tax experts to help them do their taxes or complete their returns digitally.  This expertise provides confidence for consumers and creates the halo effect for our entire TurboTax experience. The TurboTax Live funnel was strong this season. Customer awareness grew over 20% and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit grew more than 100%. Our full-service Do-It-For-Me offering attracted new customers from the assisted segment at a rate nearly 25% higher than our TurboTax Live Do-It - With -Me offering. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions with Credit Karma's data platform, and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets, and access financial expertise and advice.  To deliver on this goal, all -- our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans, and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts. Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved another record high revenue quarter in Q4 with the number of members reaching a new all-time high, fueled partly by the TurboTax integration and monthly active users, and frequency of member visits remained strong.  Within the core, credit card and personal revenue achieved another record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in transactions per member. The growth verticals also achieved an all-time revenue high, again, this quarter, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money part of our digital money offering. Just this past month or just this month, we announced the integration of QuickBooks Online payroll to deliver a better checking experience for a portion of our Small Business employees that help them manage all aspects of their financials, all in one place.  These results are evidence that successful innovation drives Credit Karma members to the platform, creating more opportunities to connect them with products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. The all-time highs we achieved are driven by focused innovation in both bolstering our proprietary AI-powered Lightbox technology and investing in growth verticals, such as home and auto, as well as pent-up demand from our partners. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to present offers to the members who have a higher likelihood of approval.  Partners usage of Lightbox in Q4 is now at an all-time high with over 50% of credit cards and over 40% of personal loan transactions flowing through, versus less than 40% and 20% a year ago. This is the power of a network effect, solving a two-sided problem. We expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper this coming year after a very strong year of investments by our partners, returning to pre-COVID investment levels. I'm very pleased with our progress and excited about the upcoming innovations. I'll end my circling back to our first big bet, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customers' pockets, eliminate friction, and deliver confidence at every touchpoint by using AI and customer insights.  This year, we accelerated our use of AI, increasing the number of models deployed across our platform by nearly 50%, saving our customers millions of hours of work. Our application of AI has dramatically increased the number of experiments we ran by more than 35% this year, made it easier for our TurboTax customers to never enter data, saving them millions of hours of manual entry and monetize our payroll offering, tripling release velocity.  We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plans to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our big bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. We will continue to invest aggressively, including in key talent to drive even faster innovation going forward. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Super. Thank you, Michelle. I'm proud of the team and always accomplished together and I'm optimistic about the future. We have a large, addressable market with digital and tailwinds that include a shift to Virtual Solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. With our strategy of becoming an AI-driven expert platform and five Big Bet s, we are positioned well for accelerated innovation and growth. Let's now open it up to your questions. Yeah. Thank you, Kirk. And good to hear from you. I will just take us back to several years ago when we talked about the importance of having a platform that really allows our customers to not only grow their business but to be able to manage their money and ensure that they are compliant.  And we've been heavily investing in payments, making it very easy for our customers to discover, making sure that we provide them with choice, accelerating our innovation in areas like instant deposit, getting paid upfront, those sorts of things.  And we -- that along with our investments in payroll, similar areas where we've really focused on making the experience far better, innovating in things like same-day payroll or next-day payroll, the shift of full-service where we have experts to help run your payroll and help you with your taxes, those are just of course two, very big and important illustrative examples where those innovations are really continuing to accelerate and beginning to pay off, especially in a time where we have digital tailwinds, where you have customers that are looking to move online, do more of their stuff online if they're already online.  And that is starting to pan out when you look at our overall services revenue, whether it's payroll, payments, time tracking, all of those areas are contributing. And I think to your question, yes, this is sustainable. We are continuing to become that platform that customers look to, to be able to run their business. Our innovations are starting to pay off and we're not standing still.  Our innovations are in fact accelerating, and we would continue to expect that we'll be there for our customers and grow with them. And I think the last thing I would say, especially with our move into the mid-market where we're starting to serve larger customers, those are larger transactions and as we continue to penetrate non-consumption in the mid-market, we would continue to see that pay off. Thank you. I'd be happy to chime in and Michelle, please don't hesitate to jump in as well. First of all, I would just take you back to our longer-term expectations is to deliver 30% online revenue growth. And there's always going to be put and takes relative to payments and payroll and accounting revenue.  So please let your, sort of, uber compass be 30% online revenue growth. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, as I was answering Kirk's question, we are seeing the impact of our innovations pay off, and more and more of our customers are migrating to full-service payroll. More of our customers are actually wanting to get started on full-service payroll because of these capabilities that it has.  And it comes with expertise to help them solve the very problem that frankly is the biggest problem that is unsaid and that is about confidence. So, we have a runway ahead of us. Ken when it comes to payroll and I would just say your compass should be 30% online revenue growth. Yes, Ken. And we'll, of course, unpack this to a more detailed level at our upcoming Investor Day. I would just tell you that I am delighted with our continued strategic progress and that will really feed into our future growth, which I think is the element of your question. When you think about our performance, I know I'm repeating some of the stats, but I think they're worth repeating.  One, we increased our total share of IRS returns by 1 point, the 2 areas that really matter most that we're focused on underpenetrated segments and transforming the assisted segments. We saw really superb results. Our overall investor volume tripled year-over-year. TurboTax Live awareness increased 20%. Our total customers grew 100%, our new customers to the franchise to TurboTax Live grew over 100%.  And with our full-service offering, it actually attracted new customers from the prior year assisted segment at a 25% higher rate than TurboTax Live Do-It-With-Me. And our retention rate stayed flat to a little bit up overall. So, when you look at all the key sort of metrics, knock on wood, it's very, very healthy and we expect that to inform next year's growth. And we do assume, by the way, that IRS returns are going to be about flattish next year.  So that's probably one important assumption that's worthwhile sharing. Though this is just a continuation as you've probably heard me say multiple times, we're on a 10-year plus run in these opportunity areas that we're focused on. And next year is just going to be another sort of important pivotal year in our quest to transform assisted and penetrated the underpenetrated segment. Alright. Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Keith. Sure, Alex. Great to hear from you. Thank you for your kind comments. On Credit Karma, let me just -- I'll briefly start at the top in terms of what we are seeing. First of all, the accelerated innovation that we are seeing with Credit Karma is really paying off, and that accelerated innovation is how we're using our combined data to be able to deliver personalized experiences, leveraging Lightbox for our customers.  It's then ensuring that we're providing relevant offers to customers in the areas that they need it most. And now we can provide multiple relevant offers, whether it's cards, personal loans, auto insurance, home loans, and beyond.  But I think then more important than when they -- the offers in front of them, we have the ability to actually help them with the potential of their approval and make it very easy when they click to actually get the offers. So those are all critical areas of innovation that are really paying off. And I think it's a testament to the platform that when our partners decided to really go after customer acquisition, that they invested a good chunk of their dollars on the platform. And it just demonstrates the network effect than the power of the data and the trust of the members that we have. So that's the first element that we just believe will continue given our accelerated innovation, because our -- ultimately, our penetration rate, maybe one of the highest in credit cards. But it's one of the lowest when you look at auto insurance. So, we have so much room for increased wallet share. In terms of synergies, Alex, we are actually quite bullish about the possibilities for the future.  And I would want you to think about those synergies in the future, and there are really several areas of synergy. One is really making Credit Karma benefits part of the entire TurboTax experience. That's one big opportunity. The other big opportunity is making it seamless and contextual, in terms of TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma experience to be able to do your taxes.  And then third, what we just announced, which is Credit Karma being part of the payroll experience where our payroll customers can actually deposit their monies into a free checking and savings account and be able to access their money early over time if they wish.  So those are significant opportunities because they're -- you're talking about millions and millions of TurboTax customers, payroll customers, and of course, over -- well over a 100 million Credit Karma customers that we're going to launch TurboTax to. This past year, and as I'll remind us, it feels like a long time, but we just closed Credit Karma in December. These past eight months, we have been experimenting with incredible purpose, incredible speed, and incredible intention. And it's informed what we are rolling out and what we're doing in the year to come. I would just say in terms of those things turning into material customer revenue growth, there -- we're not counting on that in the near-term, we're counting on that more on the mid-term because we want to really continue to nail the experience in creating ecosystem benefit across all of our members. So that's the way I would want you to think about not only what you're seeing in Credit Karma, but the growth rates that are ahead of us. Thank you, Alex. Great. Brent, just a follow-up question. The last question that you asked about trend lines, were those just general trend lines that we're seeing in small businesses? I want to make sure we captured your question correctly. Got it. Okay. Great. So, let me start with your question about the international. First of all, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, and I think the same trend continues. One thing that's unchanged is small businesses across the globe are still recovering. Some have recovered to -- back to pre-COVID levels. Some have actually accelerated their business because they changed the model. But at least what we see in our data, 20% ish of small businesses are still struggling. And struggling is defined by, they have -- their net deposits are down over 25%. So, I think it's important just as a general perspective to recognize that small businesses are in general still in recovery mode. With that said, our platform has become more critical than ever. And the digital nature of our platform to be able to run your business, grow your business, manage your cash flow, and be compliant is more important than ever, which is why, based on our innovation, overall, we're seeing this acceleration.  And then if I put that in the context of geography, I would say the U.S. has really bounced back in terms of the usage of our platform and, in fact, an acceleration probably above all, it's happened in the U.S. I would say Canada is sort of next in terms of recovery. And I would just put countries like the UK, France, Australia as really being much, much slower in the recovery. And really the reason is as you've seen, there's a lot of open, shutdown, open, shutdown and that's really impacted just a sentiment of both accountants and small businesses. But even in that context, it's actually quite exciting that we delivered 47% revenue growth in constant currency last quarter and 43% for the whole year. But with that said, we're assuming a much slower recovery international than we are in the U.S. because I think it's just really important that we get out of this health crisis. And then once we do, we believe the small businesses will bounce back much, much faster outside the U.S. International is still important for our future, but what I just shared is just how we've taken that into account strategically in both economically and our guidance as we look ahead. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Michele to answer your QuickBooks Live question. Thank you, Brad. Great question, Kash. And great to hear from you. I'll take you back to the bet that we have declared, which is we truly want to be the center of Small Business growth. And for us, it's really about helping customers grow their business.  It's helping our customers manage all of their money flow, and it's also ensuring that they can take good care of their employees and be compliant. And I think particularly, there are two areas to answer your question as we move upmarket, but it's also relevant.  One of them is very relevant to just smaller businesses that we're continuing to focus on. And that is one, how do we help you grow your business? That's both relevant to the businesses that we serve today, but also very relevant to the mid-market customers and so to be able to manage your marketing, your sales, your services, is one element. I think the other element, which is particularly important for mid-market customers is just all their GNA.  And we believe that the live platform that we've created, the engines that we've created will actually help us go beyond bookkeeping, taxes, and accounting to be able to focus on some of their -- and how they run their business and particularly the live GNA. So those are the two areas. All right. Thank you. Yes. Hi, Siti. And thank you for your kind words. I would just start with really, this has been a very intentional multiyear effort to have one platform across TurboTax, where you can do your taxes yourself. You can get assistance to do your taxes or we'll do your taxes for you. And a platform where you can choose to go back and forth within the year or in a multiyear period, we want to be the platform for your taxes and of course, obviously beyond that, with the capabilities that we have with Credit Karma.  The second element, I would say is what we learned this year, going to full launch, is that full-service offering has a halo effect and build confidence for customers, which is why we were able to attract new customers from the prior assisted method at a 25% higher rate into full-service because they know that they can digitally provide us all of their data. And we have excellent experts to be able to take very good care of them. So that's the biggest learning that we had.  It was a hypothesis that we have from prior-year experimentation and we're going to continue to scale that as we look ahead. It's just a very critical part of our platform. And as I've said before, we believe that we're in the very, very early innings of a 10-year plus opportunity here. And we just see full-service playing a very important role as we look ahead. Thank you. Yes. Sure. Thank you. Scott, good to hear from you. First of all, just as a reminder, we were one of the founding members of the Free File Alliance program with the IRS and it has been frankly, an incredible partnership with the IRS and the private industry. And when we really founded this program with the IRS, there were really two goals. And I'll simplify it. The two goals were, we wanted at that time, to ensure that electronic filing was used by more than 80% plus of all consumers. And we wanted to make sure that free filing was available to 80% plus of consumers. And when you forward the clock, mission accomplished on both, in fact, we've exceeded both metrics as an industry on both fronts. And Free has now become prevalent across the entire industry. And so, we felt that the time was right now that the mission has been accomplished to really change our approach to how we can deliver benefits for customers. Free will always be an important part of the strategy, but there are constraints when you come in through the Free File Alliance program and those constraints are, for instance, we can't provide you benefits on other platforms, like our free Credit Karma platform.  And so, as we look ahead, not only will we be able to provide free tax offerings to our customers, but as they grow and we grow with them, they can benefit from Credit Karma, they can benefit from Mint. If they are a small business, they can benefit from QuickBooks, things that we ultimately couldn't talk to them about if they were part of the Free File Alliance program. So, mission accomplished and that's the reason why we chose to get out. I just want to state again, the partnership with the IRS has absolutely been phenomenal and with private industry to achieve the goals of FFA. Sure. My apologies, I failed to answer that. No impact to margins, no impact to revenue, and some of the resources actually were that -- were on FFA, we're reallocating them to really important work in TurboTax. So, there's no impact. Yeah. Scott, I'll just start with it's an assumption, we make an assumption every year. So, what we think it will be because it's important for our planning. And because there have been two years of pretty strong total return growth, we're just assuming next year is going to be flat. We could be wrong, it could grow, but our assumption going in is it's flat. Yeah. Absolutely, Scott. Yes. Sure, Michael, and thank you for it. I know you've been waiting for a while in the queue here. We have very good visibility and I'll just be specific. We have well over 100 million customers. We see the monthly active users, which has grown quite nicely.  We actually, based on the data that we have and how we are leveraging that data with our customer's permission as part of Lightbox and the number of partners that come into Lightbox, we actually can see spend behavior. We can see our customer's activity.  We can see their financial situations and are continued to be better positioned to be able to offer them products that are right for them. So, when we see our member growth, when we see our member activity, the number of transactions, which is the number of offerings that we now have, the activity of our partners, which we're very engaged with because our partners see this platform as a great growth opportunity for them.  And the fact that we continue to be very intentional, that we are an agnostic platform. We have pretty good visibility into the future with Credit Karma. And we feel, of course, good and confident about the guidance that we provided. Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Brad. Good to hear from you. First of all, with all of the movement in the last couple of years with the pandemic and the growth that we've experienced, we're actually quite pleased with the retention rates. And I would tell you the biggest lever around retention is what we are doing with TurboTax Live, which is ensuring that our customers know and understand that there is an expert to help them every step of the way. But I think secondly, and we haven't talked much about this and we'll spend a little bit of time on this at Investor Day, is how we are now leveraging data to never lose the customer. And I give a lot of credit to our TurboTax team where we've been working on this for several years.  It's not a new body of work, but the shift from just engaging you once a year when it's tax time, to actually understanding and leveraging what we know about you. If something has changed in your life if you bought a house if you bought a car if you got married if you got divorced if you move from one state to another. It's actually engaging you year-round relative to giving your confidence that those changes can be addressed by us.  So, it's the combination of leveraging data, applying AI for that data with our models to understand who could be at risk, and then engaging those customers proactively. And by the way, depending on their needs, not just with TurboTax, it could also be engaging them with the benefits of Credit Karma. Those are the two big things, data, and AI, and the capabilities of TurboTax Live, engaging customers year-round, where we are quite confident over the long term, we can continue to increase our retention rates. Brad, the numbers are so wonky. What happened the last couple of years, I think so many people that don't have to file their taxes came in to do their taxes to get a stimulus check. And so, what really matters are some of the underlying numbers that we provided, and the fact that we gained share overall, IRS returns and within DIY, even though DIY went down. But it's just a wonkiness of the number of stimulus customers that came in that ultimately didn't have to file their taxes again this year. So that's the reasoning as we look at all the cohorts. All right, Brad. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Jackson. It's primarily originations in credit cards and personal loans. One data point is public, the other one is in our own data that we see. They're up double-digits strongly compared to pre-COVID levels. And we believe those are just going at some point taper. in the back half of the year, and it's primarily from what we see in credit cards and personal loans.  And it's really our innovation on the platform that will continue the guidance growth that we provided of 18% to 21%. But it's really in credit cards and personal loans that we believe originations will go back to pre - COVID levels, which were strong, it's just there was pent-up demand so it grew to double-digits. Thank you, Jackson. Thank you, Brad, for your question and your kind words. Let me make a couple of comments. One, the -- really are the majority of our growth is coming from customer growth and mix. And when I say mix, it's for instance, QuickBooks Advanced, which goes after the mid-market type mix. It's really not driven by price, although we have increased price this year and it's the first time, we've done it in over the last couple of years. And I'd tell you that we run tests and it's exactly as you said, it's -- we look at the price-value equation. We have very clear pricing principles. And with experimentation and data, we choose when to move forward with the price increase.  And I would tell you that our innovation, just in the last couple of years, literally last year, our innovation across the Company, which includes small business, doubled year-over-year in terms of -- and we measure that by code deployment and impact, and it's doubled again this year. And that shows up in how we leverage data and AI across the platform to deliver insights to customers. It shows up in payments and payroll and time tracking. And then what we've announced, which is moving upmarket several years ago with QuickBooks advance, it's being able to serve product-based businesses with QuickBooks commerce.  It's being able to go after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live, which is a higher sort of price tag for our customers. And then our disruptive offering with QuickBooks Cash, which is, in essence, you can start with a business bank account and be able to run your business through that. So just the innovation is I would just say staggering, focused on cohorts of customers and going after their needs, and with an open platform, we're able to really focus on what matters more to customers and monetize. So, we believe that capability is one that we'll have for years to come. Sure. Thank you, Brad. Matt, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're continuing to see strength by industry, by geography, given some of the tailwinds and our innovation that I spoke about earlier. So, with the Delta variant being the primary driver of the COVID cases and what we're seeing in different states within the U.S. having a different impact, we've really not seen an impact in our results in charge volume, the number of employees, so the strength remains. Thank you. Thank you, Michael, for your question. A couple of things. I'll start with your first question. We're very excited about the innovation across the Company. The customer segments we're pursuing, and the impact of that, that we are seeing. And in that context, we feel very good about our guidance and long-term expectations. This gets to the second question, and that is the long term, what we'll do at Investor Day, as we do every year, is we'll share our long-term expectations. So, we'll talk about that at Investor Day.  So, if you wouldn't mind maybe waiting another 3 weeks, we'll talk about that a little bit more. And the third part of your question around tax and assistance and do we have a blip from the pandemic, I would say the short answer is really no. This year, a lot of our -- a lot of accountants and stores were actually open.  I think what you're seeing here is just it's the impact of our innovation, it's raising the awareness that we have live expertise available for customers, whether we do it with you or do it for you. And in that context, this was not a blip because of the pandemic. If anything, most places were actually open and this was just based on our strategy and the results of our execution. You're very welcome. Yes. Thank you. Well, thank you very much for the wonderful questions and I want to just thank our employees, our customers, and our partners for another great quarter and I wish all of you to be safe out there and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins.\nKim Watkins: Thank you, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high for the quarter. Our tax results through the May 17, IRS tax filing deadline reflect another strong season. As a result, we are raising our revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2021. Let me start with tax. We are proud of how we delivered for our customers, and executed our strategy of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category and transforming the assisted category. Based on our performance through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline, we expect our Consumer Group revenue to grow 11% to 12% during fiscal year 2021. We expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1% and our share of total returns to expand an estimated 1 point for the tax filing season. This results in expected total customer growth of 6%, and double-digit revenue growth for the fourth year in a row. The average revenue per return increased, reflecting a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix-shift to our Premier offering used by investors. We made significant progress this season. Within the Do-It-Yourself category, we continued to double down on underpenetrated segments, including LatinX, Self-Employed, and investors. We saw a significant acceleration in investor customer growth this season and expect it to more than triple over last year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing to grow 6% this season. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We expect customers to grow more than 90% this season compared to 70% growth last year, and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit to be up more than 100%. More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on three of these Big Bets, and we will provide a detailed update on all five Big Bets at Investor Day in the fall. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions. With Credit Karma\u2019s data platform and powerful network effects, we are making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans, and insurance; and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings such as savings and checking accounts. Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved its largest quarterly revenue ever in Q3, while the number of members, monthly active users, and frequency of member visits reached all-time highs. Within the core, credit card and personal loan revenue was at a record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in both the number of partners and member engagement. The growth verticals also achieved all-time-high revenue, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering. We continue to make great progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of Credit Karma. Since the acquisition closed, TurboTax customers and migrating Turbo users accounted for 40% of new Credit Karma members, significantly accelerating new member growth. We are pleased with the initial performance of Credit Karma Money, which we integrated into the TurboTax filing experience, offering approximately 36 million TurboTax customers the opportunity to deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into no-fee checking accounts. Providing this product integration helps members achieve their financial goals, drives member engagement, and creates a new revenue stream for the company in the future. The more we successfully innovate for Credit Karma members, the more times members visit the platform, and the more opportunities we have to offer members products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We are excited about our progress with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital. QuickBooks Cash presents a full financial picture along with the ability to move money instantly and ensures that their money is working for them, while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We achieved a milestone this quarter as QuickBooks Cash balances surpassed $100 million, and we\u2019re seeing strong active use among both new and existing customers. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The usage of services such as payments, payroll, and time tracking with QBO Advanced customers is more than 30% higher than the next QBO offering in our line-up, contributing to higher ARPC while overall engagement is up over ten points year-to-date. We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our big bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non -GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.30 versus $4.11 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.07 versus $4.49 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 34% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. The revenue we are reporting today is for our third quarter ending April 30. That said, based on our performance through the May 17 tax filing deadline, we are raising our Consumer Group revenue guidance to 11% to 12% growth for fiscal 2021, up from 9% to 10% previously. There are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. Note that these levers exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects our expectations for the season through July 31, 2021 versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we expect to be up approximately 1% by the end of the season. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be approximately flat by the end of the season. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total tax returns to expand one point this season and our share of the DIY category to be up approximately one point. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix-shift to our Premier offering used by investors. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 22% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 2%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, including one point from approximately $10 million of non-recurring Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue was up 28%, including two points of growth from approximately $7 million of PPP revenue. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater online ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. We expect to return to 30% online ecosystem revenue growth at some point during fiscal '22. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 24% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth and mix-shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital grew 34% in fiscal Q3, or 31% excluding PPP revenue. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix-shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. During the quarter, we began migrating customers once again to our new full service line-up. This did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue grew 38% on a constant currency basis. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 9% in the third quarter, including approximately $3 million of PPP revenue. As a reminder, in the third quarter last year the desktop business declined sharply, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in Q3. Note that we discontinued the TurboTax and QuickBooks Self-Employed bundle this year. We remain committed to serving the self-employed segment. However, after years of experimentation, we determined that serving self-employed customers through separate TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings is most effective. There was no material impact to revenue or operating income from this decision. Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue was $316 million in Q3, as the business continues to gain momentum, reflecting growing members, member engagement and expansion of new and existing partners across verticals. Revenue reached a record high in the quarter. We are also seeing engagement reach a new high watermark, with both monthly active users and frequency of member visits at all-time highs, giving us more opportunities to offer members products that are right for them. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I\u2019ve shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $380 million of stock during the third quarter. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, payable July 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. Our guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 26% to 28%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.83 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60. We are also raising our fiscal 2021 guidance following strong performance in the first three quarters of the year. Our new guidance includes revenue growth of 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.96 to $7.01 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.32 to $9.37. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal 2021. You can find our full Q4 and updated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. I\u2019m very proud of our team and remain optimistic about the future. We have a large addressable market with secular tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. With our strategy of becoming an AI-driven expert platform and five Big Bets, we are positioned well for accelerated innovation and growth. Let's now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Very nice quarter. Good to see momentum really across all parts of the business heading into your Q4. Two questions, one for Sasan on Credit Karma. You talked a little bit about starting to see some of those revenue synergies between Credit Karma and TurboTax. Can you dive into that a little bit more in terms of versus your expectations, how well have those offers been working? I mean, I saw them when I was doing my taxes in TurboTax and saw the offers for Credit Karma. Have you you've been taking it, taking you guys up on that, has that been a material contributor as of yet? And are there like kind of linkages that we should be thinking about on the QuickBooks side of the equation where you're starting to create those connections as well? And then maybe one for Michelle? Now, we're looking for 100 basis points of margin expansion this year in the revised guidance. That's awesome. Does this take away from future years? Are we getting sort of a pull forward of operating margins or could we see consistency in this operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis? Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great Keith, thank you for your question. I've one clarifying question for you. You asked about QuickBooks, was the QuickBooks question connected to Credit Karma or was that a specific question?\nKeith Weiss: The gist of the question was around Credit Karma, like the linkages between Credit Karma and TurboTax, and then if there are any linkages between Credit Karma and QuickBooks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, got it. Very, very helpful. So, I think the place I would start it is, if you go back a year plus from the time we've been working with Credit Karma, really their focus even during the pandemic was to deliver benefits for customers from the perspective of how to manage their money, credit scores, how to get some of the COVID-19 Relief Act help. And one of the things that happened based on just the obsessive focus on customers is their engagement increased at a time where the pandemic was impacting the supply side of the equation. In addition to that, their investment in Lightbox and getting our partners to really understand Lightbox, the value of Lightbox, how it's good for consumers and how it's good for partners whether it's financial institutions and insurance companies is now really paying off, because what you're seeing now is because the member engagement was up and to the right, we have more transactions that are happening on Lightbox, which really for the consumer means a much better match and eligibility for the partner. It means they are able to also make a perfect match. All of those things is really what's resulting in the momentum that we see right now not only in the quarter, which is credit cards and personal loans and the area where the company has been investing 13-plus years, but also in the last year plus new areas which is auto insurance, auto loans, and home loans, so that's the acceleration that we're seeing. And, a lot of the synergy opportunity are going to pay off in the future. And particularly, there are several, one that we've talked about is ensuring that we with customers\u2019 permission move all their data records from TurboTax to Credit Karma, so that they can get much more personalized offers that are right for them on the first click.  The launching of Credit Karma, both in the TurboTax experience, but also launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. This is really all about a learning year. We ran 40-plus experiments, Keith learned a ton, made a number of adjustments, and I think it positions us for the months and the years ahead. So, a lot of the opportunities that we think about are better synergies between the two companies are coming in the future, and that really is what's exciting. What I would say has been a near-term impact is the fact that 40% of the new Credit Karma members actually came from either TurboTax and/or the fact that we deprecated Turbo, and that has been an instance, sort of a thrust for Credit Karma, but a lot of what I just described is yet to come, which is what's exciting about the platform. Specifically, to your question around QuickBooks, that has been sequenced for some time down the road. Keith, we're very focused on what's most important, the biggest drivers of innovation and benefits for our members, and QuickBooks is going to be something that we'll think about down the road, but it's been very intentionally sequenced, so we don't distract the team.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Super helpful.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: And Keith, your question on margin expansion, we do believe that over the long-term the platform leverage is real enabling us to expand margins. Last year, we had a point of expansion. This year before Credit Karma, we had guided 110 basis points of expansion, and now our updated guide with Credit Karma is 90 basis points of expansion, so whether that's looking at technology or customer success or go to market, there are opportunities for us to continue to leverage the platform. However, I would remind you that this year is just very unique. We were deep in the pandemic at the beginning of the year, and we were conservative with our spending. Specifically, if you look at something like Credit Karma, it really took a while even though they really started to bounce back much more quickly than we anticipated, but it took us a while to be able to ramp up the spend when we saw that, and we do feel like we will continue to invest to drive accelerated growth in there. So, I would just say this year is a little bit a unique year with the pandemic.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sasan, I wanted to dive into TurboTax Live a little bit. You highlighted seeing 90% growth, a really nice step up from the 70% last year. How should we think about where these customers came from? Is it from the assisted category? Was it from just upselling your existing base? And then any color you can provide on this initial year of full service? What that adoption rate looks like? And then for Michelle, just also a quick question on spend. It looks like R&D saw a really big step up this quarter, looked like roughly 30% year-over-year. How should we think about kind of where those investments are being funneled? And is that kind of the right pace of growth, at least for the near-term future on the product side?\nSasan Goodarzi: Great, Ken. Let me let me take the first part of your question. And thank you for the question. The thing I would start with is, I would want all of you to think about TurboTax now as a platform, and it is a platform that allows you to do your taxes yourself, or we give you the opportunity to provide an expert to help you get your taxes done with you, and/or you can, in essence hand everything off to us and we'll do your taxes for you completely. And so really the momentum of accelerating from 70% growth to 90% growth is the fact that we are continuing to build momentum. We're improving the platform. We are doing a far better job raising awareness, more folks are considering getting help in this world in a virtual world. And we're delivering really excellent experiences where our product recommendation scores are continuing to be one of the best that we've seen across the company. So, I bring that up just to say that what you're just experiencing, and what we are experiencing is momentum. And full service just plays a halo effect our role, the fundamental problem that we are solving for customers is one of confidence. And they want to know that if they need help, that they can get access to an expert or even the midstream, if they want to just hand everything off to somebody else to do their taxes, they can do it right off the bat.  And so it provides a halo effect for the entire franchise that I can get my taxes done with TurboTax. And whether or not I delegate everything now and next year, perhaps just ask for an expert or even the year after that I do it myself, that all helps the franchise. So that's the role that it's playing, which is why we're seeing the accelerated growth. And, we'll share some of the specific metrics perhaps at Investor Day, but the majority of these customers are continuing to come from the assisted category.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: And then Ken, your question R&D. First of all, I would not focus too much on what you see just quarter-to-quarter changes. It can really get a little confusing when you do that. I'd look more at the year-to-date span. But, as for where we're investing our R&D funds, when you look at the increases year-over-year, it's really around how do we continue to make investments in the platform. And that will help us drive the big bets so we can accelerate growth across the company. And so that's really where we're tending to do more of the increases in our investments with R&D.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for the clarity there, Michelle.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Sasan, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the QBO business this quarter, just in terms of what you're seeing maybe geographically in terms of the reopening? How that's impacting, not only new business formation, but the willingness for people to take on some of your higher order services, whether it's payroll, payments, even commerce or really that one early on. Or just give some more color on that that would be great. And then maybe just a quick comment on the desktop side is actually a really strong quarter for desktop. So just curious to know if there's anything sort of seasonal about that, that we should be keeping in mind.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question Kirk. A couple of things, I would say, one biggest thing that we've learned in the last year is just how resilient the platform is, and how much customers needed in very tough times. And so we are seeing usage of our services across the board up into the right and better than pre-pandemic levels. And up into the right, pretty much across all industries. We're pleased with not only the existing core platform, but some of the new innovations that we have inclusive of things like QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced, which go after a certain segment of customers, but also have a higher ARPU. What I would say is, outside of the U.S. and Canada, recovery has been slower. So from a geographic perspective, the strength is really U.S. and Canada. And then particularly answer your question on desktop, I think, as Michelle said, it's less about seasonality but more from the perspective of desktop also saw a very deep decline this time last year, and what we're seeing is just a rebound compared to a weak quarter. But overall, we're very pleased with the Small Business trajectory and where we're headed with all the innovation.\nKirk Materne: Super thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Let me quote my congratulations to Sasan, Michelle, and the team here. Two questions, one as you march up the full chain, if you will, on a QBO Advanced, I'm wondering if you have a perspective on how digital transformation on the back office is percolating into your end of the QuickBooks ecosystem? And also secondly, as a company, what are the things that you've learned during the pandemic that has caused you to accelerate your own digital transformation, internal Intuit? Any lessons that we could take from your experiences as you digitally transformed yourself? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, thank you for the question, Kash. A couple of things I would say, one, we are pleased with what we're seeing not only with our move up market, but some of the higher ARPU offerings. As I mentioned earlier, QuickBooks Advanced is not only the team doing a great job with penetration, but also our services, the usage of our services is up 30% compared to any other QBO in the lineup. What that is an indication of is just the size of the businesses that we are serving. But also, in some ways, the digital transformation for the mid-market is the same, if not a little bit behind the smaller businesses, which is why we're so excited about the possibilities with QuickBooks Advanced to truly give them a customer as a platform that becomes the source of truth for their entire business. Specifically to your question around internal, I would say that from some of the decisions that we made years ago, with a lot of the tools that we use internally, one our shifted AWS, the collaboration tools that we use internally, these were decisions and choices that we made three to four years ago. And we're fortunate that we're now using a lot of these digital tools internally, along with, of course, our shift to AWS. I would say that, although the usage went up in the pandemic, it didn't inform a different set of decisions, because I think as a team, these decisions were made proactively four to five years ago.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I got two quick ones. Maybe Sasan, first, from a big picture perspective, if you zoom out and put this tax season into context for us comparing it to last year, and then pre-pandemic, as well as how to think about it for the next few years around both unit versus ARPU growth. Clearly, this year ARPU growth was a big driver with live and assistant. But just stepping back kind of put it into context for us what do we learn? And how should we think about that algorithm going forward?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, thank you for the question, Alex. Big picture, we're very pleased with what we experienced this season. And it's consistent with what we declared several years ago. Our biggest opportunity for continued growth is to be able to transform the assisted category. There's 86 million folks that, in essence, get assistance to get their taxes done, it's more than $20 billion in size. And beyond that, there's about an $8 billion business tax segment. The second is under penetrated segments, which is investors, self-employed and LatinX. And when you look at our results this year, coming sort of out of the pandemic, our TurboTax Live platform accelerated to 90%. We saw our investor segment actually grow triple what it did last year. We always want to continue to grow units, which will then result in ARPU. I think given that our biggest opportunity is not only underpenetrated segments and transforming assisted, we may just see more ARPU than units. It's more a result of our strategy and where we are focused and where the biggest opportunity is. So if I put this season in context of our strategy, I would say it is absolutely in line with our strategy. And it's for us, it's more about just continuing to accelerate in the areas that we declared several years ago.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then on Karma. Clearly, I think, just to Keith's point, are you seeing the synergies come sooner than you thought from the rest of the business? Is it more around improvements in the macro economy, loosening lending standards? What is causing Credit Karma to be so strong so soon? And in your mind, the biggest driver for that both for Q4 and beyond from here help us model it, because the seasonality can be clearly the series a little bit unique with that respect.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. If you just step back, what really drives Credit Karma's growth is the number of numbers, the number of transactions per member, and then the revenue per transaction. So that's sort of big picture metrics. The second is if you think about Credit Karma, it's got well over 110 million customers, and it's a data platform that creates a powerful network effect. And really, it's technology driven via Lightbox. And really our opportunity is to continue to not only grow the products that we have today, which is credit cards and personal loans, but also the new products which is auto and home insurance and home loans, but also the new areas that we're moving into, which is Credit Karma Money that we've talked about, which is savings, checking, early access to wages, and then ultimately, you can also get your taxes done on Credit Karma. And by the way, there is no boundary to what product verticals that will launch over time, because we've got a relationship with over 100 million customers. We deliver personalized experiences, and they know that, we're there for them. And we're putting the power of their data in their hands. So I bring that up to say that during the pandemic, we were obsessively focused on benefits, even though the market was sort of in shambles. When I say the market because of the health crisis. So what you're seeing now is, one, the benefit a lot of the work that we did during the pandemic, launching these new verticals, delivering benefits to customers that was about how to manage their money in their credit score, and our really member engagement went up and to the right, even during the pandemic. And so now, with coming out of the pandemic, and more financial institution being in Lightbox, we're actually seeing more transactions in Lightbox, which makes a more personalized match for not only the consumer, but it benefits significantly the financial institution. So, this is not just a macro recovery, it's an end. And looking ahead, we believe that the combination of what I just described and being able to leverage our distribution of customers, combining the data that we have, that we can continue to sustain the growth in Credit Karma and of course, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Sasan, on small business online, I was curious if you could just drill into international. You did see a pretty big deceleration from 51% growth in Q1 to 38%. And I'm just curious, going back to, I think your earlier comment about the U.S. showing a good recovery. Is there anything going on there that is Intuit specific or is this more specific to what's happening in the unevenness of those recovery of those small businesses?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, actually Brent the latter part of your comment, we continue to invest in international in fact, very similar to what I just described with, we were heavily focused on delivering for customers and Credit Karma during the pandemic. We're really doing the same thing in international. It's really two big things, one, the lapping price increases, and two, the recovery is just simply much slower outside of U.S. and Canada, and it's not Intuit specific.\nBrent Thill: Great, thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Well, very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Sasan on the QBO side 28% growth with no lapping price increases. That's impressive. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of new customer acquisitions given that in the U.S., we saw a new business creation was phenomenal last three quarters. And also be interesting to hear what you're seeing on the retention side, as well in the small business.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, thank you for your question. Both new acquisition and retention is very strong, both in U.S. and Canada. And we're seeing continuing to see an acceleration in both areas. And the businesses that tend to typically come to QuickBooks, they're a little bit more mature. So it's not directly tied to new business formations. This goes back to what I've been talking about for the last, frankly, two years before the pandemic, which is we're seeing a shift to a virtual solution, a shift to online and omnichannel and a shift to digital money offering. And I think what we're just seeing here is the pandemic accelerated that five plus years and so both new acquisition and retention continues to be strong. Based on a lot of our innovation and just the economic recovery, we've seen that same strength in payroll and payments in time tracking, which is why as Michelle mentioned earlier, we actually expect sometime in our fiscal year '22 to be at or above our 30% online ecosystem growth.\nSiti Panigrahi: And then quick follow-up on the TurboTax Live full service. I'm wondering do you have any kind of technology advantage in terms of processing it faster, given that like all your competitors asking to drop it into the Dropbox or anywhere. So is there any sort of technology advantage you guys have versus your competitors there?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, let me just -- I'll talk about us, and that is that our biggest advantage is the technology. We have been building this platform and these capabilities for eight plus years. And particularly, it's in the area of machine learning, knowledge engineering and natural language processing. And everything that we are doing in TurboTax Live, whether it's providing you help with an expert or full service is all technology led. Our machine learning and knowledge engineering capabilities not only continue to make the platform easier for the consumer, but also much, much easier and insightful for the expert, which means that our experts are far more effective, far more efficient, can focus on the value that they bring to customers. And really a lot of our investments that we make in R&D go into our Live platform, which by the way, also benefits QuickBooks Live. So, we believe we have a significant technology advantage. We've been adding over the last several years process engineers that are also helping us improve our processes. And that combined with technology is really what's giving us the advantage that we have and the type of growth that we are experiencing. Because we measure not only recommendation scores by our consumers, but also for our experts, and our recommendations scores for our experts are also often to the right because of the ease of the platform.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much, and good afternoon. And congratulations, great job across all the segments. I'm going to focus on the tax segment. First off, Sasan, you all chose to wait until next quarter to depict your unit volume and your metrics in tax. And I assume that's largely because of the economic income payments from last year making it tricky. But the question embedded here is, what type of activity do you expect to see maybe as a percent of overall from May 18 to July 31 this year thinking back to past years? How much do you know is what I'm asking of the season now that you've seen the end of the tax season, when you extrapolate this guidance to the end of July? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Scott, I'll say two things. One, we have pretty good visibility to the end of the tax season, or through the end of our fiscal year, July. The main reason we didn't provide the table is the tax season is not done. Places like Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas, their deadlines have been extended to June 15. And last year, those were 10.5% of all of the Federal filings. So it's a pretty significant amount of the Federal filings. And so that was really why we wanted to provide the table when everything is conclusive. With that said, we feel good about what we see, because in some ways 90% of the season is behind us. At the same time, the season has not done yet and we're continuing to focus on winning every filer that's out there.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. And then really a two parter for my follow-up. One, I'd love your view on category shift this year. We've seen for years DIY pay category shift, and it sounds like it's going to be flattish this year. So just your thoughts on the year-over-year comparison, and it's probably something having to do with that. But your thoughts on that this year and then going forward? And then the second part of the question is, with everything you've said about 90% up in TurboTax Live customers and the Premier category tripling, really implies a lot of revenue per return growth. I'm guessing that's being offset by free of which you had a lot. So the second part of the question is your thoughts on free this year and going forward? Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sure, Scott. First of all, the way we keep score now is the total IRS returns. What we're really focused on is what is our share of all the returns. And so we're actually quite pleased that our total share of all of IRS returns is up one point. And the reason that's the way we keep score now is because of our TurboTax Live platform. So that's the first thing. I think the second thing I would say is, if you look at last year, IRS total returns were up about 3% to 4%. And then the Do-It-Yourself category actually grew about two points. And this year was flat. And so when we think about the category, we actually look at it over a two year period because it's really not comparing apples to apples. It was a very unusual last year with all of the folks that came in because of the stimulus check. So, we're actually quite pleased that when you look at this year in context of last year, that our share of total IRS went up one point, the categories stayed flat, and then our share within the category went up one point. So we're very, very pleased with the results. But I also wanted to just emphasize how we really keep score. I think the second thing I would say is, our free grew 6% this year, the pay nothing customers. And that compares to 20% growth last year. So we actually feel like free moderated and it's in the vicinity that we would have predicted and assumed and really, our growth came from the areas that are very strategic, which is both transforming the assisted category with TurboTax Live and then the under penetrated segments, which is what we expect for continued growth as we look in the years ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Got it. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please?\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. My congrats on executing through, it was certainly a unique year here as well. Online ecosystem showing signs of rebound as we get through the course of the year 26% ex-PPP, sounds like there's still confidence and ability to return to that 30% plus target level. Anything else you can add just around what provides confidence in reinforcing and getting back to that level of giving increasing scale? And maybe how we should think about the mix between services and QBO?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Michael, thank you for your question. What really gives us confidence is, the fact that when you look at the total SMB market, nearly 70% of that market is service based businesses and about 30% are product based businesses. And the majority of all of those customers are what we call non-consumption, they're not using a digital platform, they're managing their life and their business through a shoebox, or a Google Sheet or an Excel spreadsheet. So what gives us confidence is really the innovation and the focus of our innovation in the last several years. One, we are now positioned to continue to deliver for service based businesses, all of our innovation. We now have QuickBooks commerce, that gives us the opportunity to also serve product based businesses. We're able to disrupt from the bottom with QuickBooks Cash, which is a business banking account. And really, we're able to go after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live, which really solves the confidence problem, and provides access to an expert for our customers, whether one-time or ongoing basis, and we're positioned to go up market with QuickBooks Advanced. And within that, what I didn't mention is, of course, all of our innovation and payments, payroll, time tracking, et cetera. So, what really gives us confidence is the fact that we're positioned well to serve the market in a meaningful way. We've continued to improve the experience of our platform. We have more partners on our platform, and we're a true open platform. And really, we are rethinking our go to market, both from a sales and marketing perspective. So it's really our innovation and transformation of sales and marketing that gives us confidence. Now that the economy is starting to come back, that is really what sort of is the ultimate confidence factor as we look at 30% plus online revenue growth.\nMichael Turrin: That's all very helpful. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great. It's Jackson Ader on for Sterling. Thanks for taking our questions. Actually, just a quick one from us. And it's on the investors. So tripling the investor base is certainly positive. And I'm just curious what that retention rate looks like for those TurboTax Investor customers relative to maybe the entire TurboTax space?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. In looking at history, those that have used our Premier offering have actually had one of the highest retention rates, because of just the type of customer and the complexity of the customer. This tripling this year was both new customers coming into the franchise and actually existing customers that upgraded to Premier, because they in essence took on investments that they may not have done in the past. If we just look at the experience that we delivered for them, the product recommendation scores in history, we would feel good about the retention going forward.\nJackson Ader: Okay, all right. Great. That's all we had. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe pushing on the retention theme a little bit. Sasan, as you think about the early cohorts of TurboTax Live customers, have they for the most part remained in the live skew? Or, is it a fluid situation with some years they take it, some years they move back to Quick TurboTax.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Brad, it's actually somewhat fluid and we like it. Now that we're in our fourth year of TurboTax Live, one of the things that we love about it is customers that come in that we typically would have lost because they wouldn't have access to an expert will upgrade to TurboTax Live. We've not divulged the percentages, but good percentage will stay in TurboTax Live the second year, some actually go back to TurboTax. And now this year, we saw some that started in live the year after went back to TurboTax and this year came back to TurboTax Live. We've not divulged any of the percentages. But what's great about that is, back to the Uber point, which is we are solving a major confidence problem. What we really care about is that we can solve the customer's problem and the confidence factor, and that they stay in the franchise. And going back and forth between Do-It-Yourself, I need help with an expert or here's all my stuff just do it for me is the cycle that we are seeing. We're actually pleased with what we're seeing.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe if I reflect on that 90% growth in live obviously QuickBooks Live is also growing. To your comments, the economy's reopening, the macro economy looks better. How are you going to keep your expert partners on the platform in the year ahead? I suspect over the last 12-months is pretty easy to get folks in the door. But maybe talk about your retention strategy to keep those expert partners on the platform in the year ahead.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, thank you for your question, Daniel. In fact, I would share with you that the last couple of years, it's not been easy, because everybody is -- and I don't mean in our space, but everybody's actually trying to find ways to shift to a virtual world and the pandemic just simply accelerated. So, as we look ahead, we're not looking at headwinds, because we've actually been dealing with a market that's really going after these type of experts in multiple different industries. There's a couple of things that not only helps us retain our experts, but acquire more and this is, of course based on verbatims and talking to our experts. One, it's our culture, it is the way we treat employees, it's the benefits that we deliver. It's the overall employee experience that they have. And they're truly able to work virtually with the setup that they need and to do what they love, which is deliver for customers and not have to market their services. We are unique in that. We don't ask our experts to sell, we ask our experts to do one thing, which is deliver an awesome experience for our customers. We've had a quite high retention rate. We have been able to recruit the best of the best. And by the way, we actually have very high standards. We have what we call A for A process, which is assessing for awesome. They have to pass certain hurdles to be able to join us. We measure the recommendation scores. So there's a service standard that they have to be able to deliver against. And now we also provide certifications. And so we help them with education to get certified and to actually be able to grow their careers. So we really treat our experts like the way we would care for and treat employees, and that is I would say the differentiator beyond the course the benefits that we provide.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question, please?\nKartik Mehta: Hey, Sasan. I wanted to go back to your Credit Karma comments and new customer growth. And I'm wondering, if you look at the new customer growth that you've seen in the most recent quarter, or maybe the last few months, are you kind of back to the pre-pandemic level? Obviously, not when Credit Karma started but as the company matured and kind of if you look at 2019 and compare it to where you are today.\nSasan Goodarzi: Kartik, good to hear from you. I think without getting into the numbers, which again, we'll talk about more at Investor Day. The place I would start as Credit Karma, significantly during the pandemic reduced their marketing and really focus on the 100 million customers that they had to really focus on ensuring that they could manage through the pandemic, which is a lot of the reasons why we're seeing the type of bounce that we're seeing now, because they truly took good care of their customers during the pandemic. And really the big thrust is now we're starting to do marketing with Credit Karma not only within app, but also outside of the app, and 40% of the customers that came in or members that came in were all Intuit customers that chose Credit Karma. So, I would say in some ways, we're probably above pre-pandemic levels, and we're excited about the possibilities as we look ahead.\nKartik Mehta: And then just on the TurboTax full service solution, which you're having very good success with. As you look at the type of customers that are drawn to that solution, what's kind of the breakdown? Or, what are greater number of customers? Are the ones that are using more simple services? Do they have very complex returns?\nSasan Goodarzi: It's a variety, Kartik. It comes down to confidence. Those customers that -- let me actually take a step back, out of the 86 million folks that use an assisted method based on our own research that we did several years ago, 70 million are willing to switch to a digital solution as long as they can have access to an expert. So really, these are folks that are choosing to use a digital platform, as long as they can get expert help and their needs could vary. So it's not just the simple filers, it's really an individual that chooses to use a digital platform with expertise. And so we're getting all kinds of variety of folks that are choosing to come to TurboTax Live, and not just TurboTax full service.\nKartik Mehta: Well, thank you, Sasan, I appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, thanks. Just had a question around the free users that you've added over the past two years, a big part of the model has been the ability to bring customers in through free and then have them move up to other tiers, as they experienced certain life events. Are you seeing any difference in the cohorts that you've brought in over the past two years in terms of that ability to potentially monetize these free users over time? And then, are you also able to market Credit Karma to these customers? Or, are there some restrictions around that, depending upon how they come into the Intuit franchise? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sure, Matt. Our strategy is unchanged. We want as many free customers as we can get for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. One, we want to serve those customers, but then, two, over time, as a life situation changes, they may have different tax needs. But now with Credit Karma, we have an opportunity to provide other benefits beyond taxes. So our strategy is unchanged. I would say, if I use this year particularly as an example, we have end to end focus on free, and particularly with TurboTax Live basic, where we got quite a bit of folks that came in, that were from the assisted category that we love, because ultimately, it's about transforming the assisted category. So, our strategy is unchanged. And the growth that we saw was really in line with what we would have expected. There are no restrictions with Credit Karma. As I mentioned earlier, we have one launched Credit Karma as a test as part of the TurboTax filing experience. And we have launched TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we ran 40 tests this year, just to learn to understand how we could really nail the experience. And we're going to be able to now given our learning scales to a different level, as we look at it, but there are no restrictions in terms of what we can and can't do. It's really all focused on the customer experience.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thanks, guys. And congratulations on a real nice quarter. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Advanced. You've obviously seen some real traction there. And it's an effort to kind of move up market. Is there a limit where perhaps, you draw the line north of which it's going to be difficult for QuickBooks to kind of go? Or, is this really an opportunity, maybe even to go into the next year, maybe in the lower end of the mid-market at some point as you kind of move up market with QuickBooks Advanced? Obviously, there's that balance between optimizing for the Small Business and then features for larger organizations. So how are you thinking about that balance? And where would that limit potentially be? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sure, Brad. Thank you. First of all, our initial limit that we set just for the sake of focus and really nailing the experience has been small businesses that are between 10 to 100 employees. We are very pleased with our progress. We're continuing to build out the platform to be able to continue to move up market, even within that 10 to 100 employee segment. With that said, to your question, we don't believe that there's a limit other than what we don't want to do is serve the Intuit's of the world. We don't want to get into a place where we're serving a company the size of Intuit. And we don't want to get into a place where we get into professional services, and we're having to customize the platform. We want it to be something that we can scale, and that is durable. So, the limit will not stop at 100. We put that limit on ourselves to ensure that we can really nail the experience and be very intentional and focused around our scaling. And at the right time, of course, we'll communicate to you all when we choose to go beyond 100. But we believe that there's an opportunity beyond the segment that we serve today.\nBrad Sills: That's great, Sasan. One more similar question on TurboTax, with the progress you're seeing in full service, do you feel you have the talent base within your CPA pool to be able to kind of go into even some of the most sophisticated tax returns, as you move up into different tax brackets and complexity for returns? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. We do and we're providing our own training and certification, because one of the things that's really exciting and unique about what we're doing is, we are going after a confidence problem for both consumers and small businesses. So as we recruit, we're not only recruiting to ensure that we have the right expertise that can deliver for customers need to get their taxes on, but also for small businesses that not only need advice, but need to get their quarterly taxes done. So in addition to hiring the best of the best, and looking at partners that are in the marketplace, we also are building our own capabilities around training and certification. So with both those dimensions, we feel really good about the type of skill that we'll be able to acquire and retain, but also how we can grow those skills.\nBrad Sills: That's great. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Millman: Thank you. I guess, it's a question of what accelerated means. So, can I look at your bottom line and expect accelerated earnings? By that I mean, one year at 15%, next year at 17% and so on. Second question, sort of unrelated to that is on the TurboTax Live. How many returns did you actually report as assisted this year? And how does that compare with last year? And where do you think that number is going?\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Michael, thank you for your question. A couple of things. I would say, one, of course, we've provided guidance for the remainder of the year and we're very excited and pleased that we were able to raise our guidance. And we'll talk more at our Investor Day around guidance for not only FY '22, but one thing Michelle and I will do as we did last year is beyond guidance, just talk about our long-term expectation. So, I think I would say, let's wait till Investor Day to have the conversation beyond the fiscal year that we are in. In terms of TurboTax Live, we intentionally do not report the actual numbers in TurboTax Live other than just our growth rate. I would just reiterate that it is the fastest continues to be the fastest growing platform and products in the company. We're very pleased that it actually accelerated growth from last year on top of a very good year last year. And then majority of these customers are coming to us from the assisted category that are -- and one thing we're pleased about is, we had a growth of 100% of customers that are completely new to Intuit that came to TurboTax Live. So those are some of the stats and numbers that we've chosen to share publicly, and we'll look forward to sharing more at Investor Day.\nMichael Millman: Can I assume and roughly it's a wash so is coming from assisted to you on one hand offset of those going into assisted?\nSasan Goodarzi: No, I wouldn't call it a wash at all. It's actually why we're able to grow our total pace base of customers year-after-year. So no, no it is not wash. And the metrics that I shared earlier, when you look the total number of IRS returns, our share of that total actually increased one point, which means that our base continues to increase. No, it is not a wash, it is an increase in share by Intuit.\nMichael Millman: Okay, thank you. Appreciate your information.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJosh Beck: Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask maybe a two parter team. One is around Credit Karma Money, certainly you had a really good progress. I think you offered 36 million direct deposits. I'm just wondering, how important is it for you to really translate that into maybe a regular payroll direct deposit, as you think about the strategy there? And a little bit related, just with the amount of momentum and success that you are already seeing with Credit Karma, does it maybe make you revisit the M&A aperture and maybe want to consider more of these larger transformative types of deals? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Great, Josh. Thank you. First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 36 million customers actually took us up on Credit Karma Money. I wish they did and our goal is they will over time, but I wanted to just make sure that that was clear. To the question that you asked, it's actually a great question, it gives me an opportunity to just very quickly paint a picture. And that is, I'll go back to what I shared earlier, which is the more we provide services and benefits to Credit Karma members, the more they will come back to the platform through our notifications, and the more they will engage with the services and the more we have an opportunity to actually present more products to them, and then over time, be able to monetize that to drive our revenue growth. So the power of Credit Karma Money is if you have a checking account, well, that's our savings account where you choose to take us off on direct payroll deposits, so we can give you early access to your paycheck. Not everything is necessarily about monetizing every single benefit, but the more we bring you back, the more than we can offer you, hey, Josh, we have a pre-approved credit card that's right for you, hey, Josh, it looks like you're paying ex for your auto insurance, we have an offer based on your driving habits to pay 20% less.  So it becomes truly the vision that I described earlier, which is a financial assistant in your pocket where we are in your corner, to try to help you reduce your debt and put more money in your pocket. So, we're not overly reliant on direct deposits by any means. But it just becomes another benefit and a reason to engage with the platform, which gives us opportunities to offer more products to you and then be able to monetize. To your last question about M&A, our principles around M&A are steadfast. We, of course have just based on some of the acquisitions we've made in the last several years and how well they've done we have a lot more confidence in our ability to execute, because we truly studied our history in the last 10-years, what went well, what didn't go well. And that's informed, I mean, a lot of our approaches today. And really it for us, everything is about speed to market. And so if there is talent we need to acquire, technology we need to acquire or capability like Credit Karma, those principles were informed decisions. And of course, our confidence has continued to grow, given the execution of the recent acquisitions.\nJosh Beck: Thanks so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, I'll be very brief. Thank you for your wonderful questions. And again, I want to thank our Intuit team and all of our partners for everything that they're doing to innovate for our customers. And we look forward to talking to you at our next earnings. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non -GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.30 versus $4.11 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.07 versus $4.49 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 34% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. The revenue we are reporting today is for our third quarter ending April 30. That said, based on our performance through the May 17 tax filing deadline, we are raising our Consumer Group revenue guidance to 11% to 12% growth for fiscal 2021, up from 9% to 10% previously. There are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. Note that these levers exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects our expectations for the season through July 31, 2021 versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we expect to be up approximately 1% by the end of the season. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be approximately flat by the end of the season. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total tax returns to expand one point this season and our share of the DIY category to be up approximately one point. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix-shift to our Premier offering used by investors. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 22% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 2%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, including one point from approximately $10 million of non-recurring Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue was up 28%, including two points of growth from approximately $7 million of PPP revenue. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater online ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. We expect to return to 30% online ecosystem revenue growth at some point during fiscal '22. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 24% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth and mix-shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital grew 34% in fiscal Q3, or 31% excluding PPP revenue. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix-shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. During the quarter, we began migrating customers once again to our new full service line-up. This did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue grew 38% on a constant currency basis. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 9% in the third quarter, including approximately $3 million of PPP revenue. As a reminder, in the third quarter last year the desktop business declined sharply, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in Q3. Note that we discontinued the TurboTax and QuickBooks Self-Employed bundle this year. We remain committed to serving the self-employed segment. However, after years of experimentation, we determined that serving self-employed customers through separate TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings is most effective. There was no material impact to revenue or operating income from this decision. Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue was $316 million in Q3, as the business continues to gain momentum, reflecting growing members, member engagement and expansion of new and existing partners across verticals. Revenue reached a record high in the quarter. We are also seeing engagement reach a new high watermark, with both monthly active users and frequency of member visits at all-time highs, giving us more opportunities to offer members products that are right for them. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $380 million of stock during the third quarter. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, payable July 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. Our guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 26% to 28%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.83 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60. We are also raising our fiscal 2021 guidance following strong performance in the first three quarters of the year. Our new guidance includes revenue growth of 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.96 to $7.01 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.32 to $9.37. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal 2021. You can find our full Q4 and updated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. And Keith, your question on margin expansion, we do believe that over the long-term the platform leverage is real enabling us to expand margins. Last year, we had a point of expansion. This year before Credit Karma, we had guided 110 basis points of expansion, and now our updated guide with Credit Karma is 90 basis points of expansion, so whether that's looking at technology or customer success or go to market, there are opportunities for us to continue to leverage the platform. However, I would remind you that this year is just very unique. We were deep in the pandemic at the beginning of the year, and we were conservative with our spending. Specifically, if you look at something like Credit Karma, it really took a while even though they really started to bounce back much more quickly than we anticipated, but it took us a while to be able to ramp up the spend when we saw that, and we do feel like we will continue to invest to drive accelerated growth in there. So, I would just say this year is a little bit a unique year with the pandemic. And then Ken, your question R&D. First of all, I would not focus too much on what you see just quarter-to-quarter changes. It can really get a little confusing when you do that. I'd look more at the year-to-date span. But, as for where we're investing our R&D funds, when you look at the increases year-over-year, it's really around how do we continue to make investments in the platform. And that will help us drive the big bets so we can accelerate growth across the company. And so that's really where we're tending to do more of the increases in our investments with R&D."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high for the quarter. Our tax results through the May 17, IRS tax filing deadline reflect another strong season. As a result, we are raising our revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2021. Let me start with tax. We are proud of how we delivered for our customers, and executed our strategy of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category and transforming the assisted category. Based on our performance through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline, we expect our Consumer Group revenue to grow 11% to 12% during fiscal year 2021. We expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1% and our share of total returns to expand an estimated 1 point for the tax filing season. This results in expected total customer growth of 6%, and double-digit revenue growth for the fourth year in a row. The average revenue per return increased, reflecting a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix-shift to our Premier offering used by investors. We made significant progress this season. Within the Do-It-Yourself category, we continued to double down on underpenetrated segments, including LatinX, Self-Employed, and investors. We saw a significant acceleration in investor customer growth this season and expect it to more than triple over last year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing to grow 6% this season. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We expect customers to grow more than 90% this season compared to 70% growth last year, and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit to be up more than 100%. More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on three of these Big Bets, and we will provide a detailed update on all five Big Bets at Investor Day in the fall. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions. With Credit Karma's data platform and powerful network effects, we are making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans, and insurance; and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings such as savings and checking accounts. Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved its largest quarterly revenue ever in Q3, while the number of members, monthly active users, and frequency of member visits reached all-time highs. Within the core, credit card and personal loan revenue was at a record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in both the number of partners and member engagement. The growth verticals also achieved all-time-high revenue, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering. We continue to make great progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of Credit Karma. Since the acquisition closed, TurboTax customers and migrating Turbo users accounted for 40% of new Credit Karma members, significantly accelerating new member growth. We are pleased with the initial performance of Credit Karma Money, which we integrated into the TurboTax filing experience, offering approximately 36 million TurboTax customers the opportunity to deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into no-fee checking accounts. Providing this product integration helps members achieve their financial goals, drives member engagement, and creates a new revenue stream for the company in the future. The more we successfully innovate for Credit Karma members, the more times members visit the platform, and the more opportunities we have to offer members products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We are excited about our progress with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital. QuickBooks Cash presents a full financial picture along with the ability to move money instantly and ensures that their money is working for them, while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We achieved a milestone this quarter as QuickBooks Cash balances surpassed $100 million, and we're seeing strong active use among both new and existing customers. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The usage of services such as payments, payroll, and time tracking with QBO Advanced customers is more than 30% higher than the next QBO offering in our line-up, contributing to higher ARPC while overall engagement is up over ten points year-to-date. We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our big bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. I'm very proud of our team and remain optimistic about the future. We have a large addressable market with secular tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. With our strategy of becoming an AI-driven expert platform and five Big Bets, we are positioned well for accelerated innovation and growth. Let's now open it up to your questions. Great Keith, thank you for your question. I've one clarifying question for you. You asked about QuickBooks, was the QuickBooks question connected to Credit Karma or was that a specific question? Yeah, got it. Very, very helpful. So, I think the place I would start it is, if you go back a year plus from the time we've been working with Credit Karma, really their focus even during the pandemic was to deliver benefits for customers from the perspective of how to manage their money, credit scores, how to get some of the COVID-19 Relief Act help. And one of the things that happened based on just the obsessive focus on customers is their engagement increased at a time where the pandemic was impacting the supply side of the equation. In addition to that, their investment in Lightbox and getting our partners to really understand Lightbox, the value of Lightbox, how it's good for consumers and how it's good for partners whether it's financial institutions and insurance companies is now really paying off, because what you're seeing now is because the member engagement was up and to the right, we have more transactions that are happening on Lightbox, which really for the consumer means a much better match and eligibility for the partner. It means they are able to also make a perfect match. All of those things is really what's resulting in the momentum that we see right now not only in the quarter, which is credit cards and personal loans and the area where the company has been investing 13-plus years, but also in the last year plus new areas which is auto insurance, auto loans, and home loans, so that's the acceleration that we're seeing. And, a lot of the synergy opportunity are going to pay off in the future. And particularly, there are several, one that we've talked about is ensuring that we with customers' permission move all their data records from TurboTax to Credit Karma, so that they can get much more personalized offers that are right for them on the first click.  The launching of Credit Karma, both in the TurboTax experience, but also launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. This is really all about a learning year. We ran 40-plus experiments, Keith learned a ton, made a number of adjustments, and I think it positions us for the months and the years ahead. So, a lot of the opportunities that we think about are better synergies between the two companies are coming in the future, and that really is what's exciting. What I would say has been a near-term impact is the fact that 40% of the new Credit Karma members actually came from either TurboTax and/or the fact that we deprecated Turbo, and that has been an instance, sort of a thrust for Credit Karma, but a lot of what I just described is yet to come, which is what's exciting about the platform. Specifically, to your question around QuickBooks, that has been sequenced for some time down the road. Keith, we're very focused on what's most important, the biggest drivers of innovation and benefits for our members, and QuickBooks is going to be something that we'll think about down the road, but it's been very intentionally sequenced, so we don't distract the team. Thank you, Keith. Great, Ken. Let me let me take the first part of your question. And thank you for the question. The thing I would start with is, I would want all of you to think about TurboTax now as a platform, and it is a platform that allows you to do your taxes yourself, or we give you the opportunity to provide an expert to help you get your taxes done with you, and/or you can, in essence hand everything off to us and we'll do your taxes for you completely. And so really the momentum of accelerating from 70% growth to 90% growth is the fact that we are continuing to build momentum. We're improving the platform. We are doing a far better job raising awareness, more folks are considering getting help in this world in a virtual world. And we're delivering really excellent experiences where our product recommendation scores are continuing to be one of the best that we've seen across the company. So, I bring that up just to say that what you're just experiencing, and what we are experiencing is momentum. And full service just plays a halo effect our role, the fundamental problem that we are solving for customers is one of confidence. And they want to know that if they need help, that they can get access to an expert or even the midstream, if they want to just hand everything off to somebody else to do their taxes, they can do it right off the bat.  And so it provides a halo effect for the entire franchise that I can get my taxes done with TurboTax. And whether or not I delegate everything now and next year, perhaps just ask for an expert or even the year after that I do it myself, that all helps the franchise. So that's the role that it's playing, which is why we're seeing the accelerated growth. And, we'll share some of the specific metrics perhaps at Investor Day, but the majority of these customers are continuing to come from the assisted category. Thank you, Ken. Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question Kirk. A couple of things, I would say, one biggest thing that we've learned in the last year is just how resilient the platform is, and how much customers needed in very tough times. And so we are seeing usage of our services across the board up into the right and better than pre-pandemic levels. And up into the right, pretty much across all industries. We're pleased with not only the existing core platform, but some of the new innovations that we have inclusive of things like QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced, which go after a certain segment of customers, but also have a higher ARPU. What I would say is, outside of the U.S. and Canada, recovery has been slower. So from a geographic perspective, the strength is really U.S. and Canada. And then particularly answer your question on desktop, I think, as Michelle said, it's less about seasonality but more from the perspective of desktop also saw a very deep decline this time last year, and what we're seeing is just a rebound compared to a weak quarter. But overall, we're very pleased with the Small Business trajectory and where we're headed with all the innovation. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for the question, Kash. A couple of things I would say, one, we are pleased with what we're seeing not only with our move up market, but some of the higher ARPU offerings. As I mentioned earlier, QuickBooks Advanced is not only the team doing a great job with penetration, but also our services, the usage of our services is up 30% compared to any other QBO in the lineup. What that is an indication of is just the size of the businesses that we are serving. But also, in some ways, the digital transformation for the mid-market is the same, if not a little bit behind the smaller businesses, which is why we're so excited about the possibilities with QuickBooks Advanced to truly give them a customer as a platform that becomes the source of truth for their entire business. Specifically to your question around internal, I would say that from some of the decisions that we made years ago, with a lot of the tools that we use internally, one our shifted AWS, the collaboration tools that we use internally, these were decisions and choices that we made three to four years ago. And we're fortunate that we're now using a lot of these digital tools internally, along with, of course, our shift to AWS. I would say that, although the usage went up in the pandemic, it didn't inform a different set of decisions, because I think as a team, these decisions were made proactively four to five years ago. Yeah, very welcome. Yeah, thank you for the question, Alex. Big picture, we're very pleased with what we experienced this season. And it's consistent with what we declared several years ago. Our biggest opportunity for continued growth is to be able to transform the assisted category. There's 86 million folks that, in essence, get assistance to get their taxes done, it's more than $20 billion in size. And beyond that, there's about an $8 billion business tax segment. The second is under penetrated segments, which is investors, self-employed and LatinX. And when you look at our results this year, coming sort of out of the pandemic, our TurboTax Live platform accelerated to 90%. We saw our investor segment actually grow triple what it did last year. We always want to continue to grow units, which will then result in ARPU. I think given that our biggest opportunity is not only underpenetrated segments and transforming assisted, we may just see more ARPU than units. It's more a result of our strategy and where we are focused and where the biggest opportunity is. So if I put this season in context of our strategy, I would say it is absolutely in line with our strategy. And it's for us, it's more about just continuing to accelerate in the areas that we declared several years ago. Yeah. If you just step back, what really drives Credit Karma's growth is the number of numbers, the number of transactions per member, and then the revenue per transaction. So that's sort of big picture metrics. The second is if you think about Credit Karma, it's got well over 110 million customers, and it's a data platform that creates a powerful network effect. And really, it's technology driven via Lightbox. And really our opportunity is to continue to not only grow the products that we have today, which is credit cards and personal loans, but also the new products which is auto and home insurance and home loans, but also the new areas that we're moving into, which is Credit Karma Money that we've talked about, which is savings, checking, early access to wages, and then ultimately, you can also get your taxes done on Credit Karma. And by the way, there is no boundary to what product verticals that will launch over time, because we've got a relationship with over 100 million customers. We deliver personalized experiences, and they know that, we're there for them. And we're putting the power of their data in their hands. So I bring that up to say that during the pandemic, we were obsessively focused on benefits, even though the market was sort of in shambles. When I say the market because of the health crisis. So what you're seeing now is, one, the benefit a lot of the work that we did during the pandemic, launching these new verticals, delivering benefits to customers that was about how to manage their money in their credit score, and our really member engagement went up and to the right, even during the pandemic. And so now, with coming out of the pandemic, and more financial institution being in Lightbox, we're actually seeing more transactions in Lightbox, which makes a more personalized match for not only the consumer, but it benefits significantly the financial institution. So, this is not just a macro recovery, it's an end. And looking ahead, we believe that the combination of what I just described and being able to leverage our distribution of customers, combining the data that we have, that we can continue to sustain the growth in Credit Karma and of course, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day. Yeah. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, actually Brent the latter part of your comment, we continue to invest in international in fact, very similar to what I just described with, we were heavily focused on delivering for customers and Credit Karma during the pandemic. We're really doing the same thing in international. It's really two big things, one, the lapping price increases, and two, the recovery is just simply much slower outside of U.S. and Canada, and it's not Intuit specific. Yeah. Well, very welcome. Yeah, thank you for your question. Both new acquisition and retention is very strong, both in U.S. and Canada. And we're seeing continuing to see an acceleration in both areas. And the businesses that tend to typically come to QuickBooks, they're a little bit more mature. So it's not directly tied to new business formations. This goes back to what I've been talking about for the last, frankly, two years before the pandemic, which is we're seeing a shift to a virtual solution, a shift to online and omnichannel and a shift to digital money offering. And I think what we're just seeing here is the pandemic accelerated that five plus years and so both new acquisition and retention continues to be strong. Based on a lot of our innovation and just the economic recovery, we've seen that same strength in payroll and payments in time tracking, which is why as Michelle mentioned earlier, we actually expect sometime in our fiscal year '22 to be at or above our 30% online ecosystem growth. Yeah, let me just -- I'll talk about us, and that is that our biggest advantage is the technology. We have been building this platform and these capabilities for eight plus years. And particularly, it's in the area of machine learning, knowledge engineering and natural language processing. And everything that we are doing in TurboTax Live, whether it's providing you help with an expert or full service is all technology led. Our machine learning and knowledge engineering capabilities not only continue to make the platform easier for the consumer, but also much, much easier and insightful for the expert, which means that our experts are far more effective, far more efficient, can focus on the value that they bring to customers. And really a lot of our investments that we make in R&D go into our Live platform, which by the way, also benefits QuickBooks Live. So, we believe we have a significant technology advantage. We've been adding over the last several years process engineers that are also helping us improve our processes. And that combined with technology is really what's giving us the advantage that we have and the type of growth that we are experiencing. Because we measure not only recommendation scores by our consumers, but also for our experts, and our recommendations scores for our experts are also often to the right because of the ease of the platform. Yeah, very welcome. Yeah, sure. Scott, I'll say two things. One, we have pretty good visibility to the end of the tax season, or through the end of our fiscal year, July. The main reason we didn't provide the table is the tax season is not done. Places like Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas, their deadlines have been extended to June 15. And last year, those were 10.5% of all of the Federal filings. So it's a pretty significant amount of the Federal filings. And so that was really why we wanted to provide the table when everything is conclusive. With that said, we feel good about what we see, because in some ways 90% of the season is behind us. At the same time, the season has not done yet and we're continuing to focus on winning every filer that's out there. Yeah. Sure, Scott. First of all, the way we keep score now is the total IRS returns. What we're really focused on is what is our share of all the returns. And so we're actually quite pleased that our total share of all of IRS returns is up one point. And the reason that's the way we keep score now is because of our TurboTax Live platform. So that's the first thing. I think the second thing I would say is, if you look at last year, IRS total returns were up about 3% to 4%. And then the Do-It-Yourself category actually grew about two points. And this year was flat. And so when we think about the category, we actually look at it over a two year period because it's really not comparing apples to apples. It was a very unusual last year with all of the folks that came in because of the stimulus check. So, we're actually quite pleased that when you look at this year in context of last year, that our share of total IRS went up one point, the categories stayed flat, and then our share within the category went up one point. So we're very, very pleased with the results. But I also wanted to just emphasize how we really keep score. I think the second thing I would say is, our free grew 6% this year, the pay nothing customers. And that compares to 20% growth last year. So we actually feel like free moderated and it's in the vicinity that we would have predicted and assumed and really, our growth came from the areas that are very strategic, which is both transforming the assisted category with TurboTax Live and then the under penetrated segments, which is what we expect for continued growth as we look in the years ahead. Thanks, Scott. Yeah, sure. Michael, thank you for your question. What really gives us confidence is, the fact that when you look at the total SMB market, nearly 70% of that market is service based businesses and about 30% are product based businesses. And the majority of all of those customers are what we call non-consumption, they're not using a digital platform, they're managing their life and their business through a shoebox, or a Google Sheet or an Excel spreadsheet. So what gives us confidence is really the innovation and the focus of our innovation in the last several years. One, we are now positioned to continue to deliver for service based businesses, all of our innovation. We now have QuickBooks commerce, that gives us the opportunity to also serve product based businesses. We're able to disrupt from the bottom with QuickBooks Cash, which is a business banking account. And really, we're able to go after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live, which really solves the confidence problem, and provides access to an expert for our customers, whether one-time or ongoing basis, and we're positioned to go up market with QuickBooks Advanced. And within that, what I didn't mention is, of course, all of our innovation and payments, payroll, time tracking, et cetera. So, what really gives us confidence is the fact that we're positioned well to serve the market in a meaningful way. We've continued to improve the experience of our platform. We have more partners on our platform, and we're a true open platform. And really, we are rethinking our go to market, both from a sales and marketing perspective. So it's really our innovation and transformation of sales and marketing that gives us confidence. Now that the economy is starting to come back, that is really what sort of is the ultimate confidence factor as we look at 30% plus online revenue growth. Thank you. Yeah, sure. In looking at history, those that have used our Premier offering have actually had one of the highest retention rates, because of just the type of customer and the complexity of the customer. This tripling this year was both new customers coming into the franchise and actually existing customers that upgraded to Premier, because they in essence took on investments that they may not have done in the past. If we just look at the experience that we delivered for them, the product recommendation scores in history, we would feel good about the retention going forward. Thank you. Yeah. Brad, it's actually somewhat fluid and we like it. Now that we're in our fourth year of TurboTax Live, one of the things that we love about it is customers that come in that we typically would have lost because they wouldn't have access to an expert will upgrade to TurboTax Live. We've not divulged the percentages, but good percentage will stay in TurboTax Live the second year, some actually go back to TurboTax. And now this year, we saw some that started in live the year after went back to TurboTax and this year came back to TurboTax Live. We've not divulged any of the percentages. But what's great about that is, back to the Uber point, which is we are solving a major confidence problem. What we really care about is that we can solve the customer's problem and the confidence factor, and that they stay in the franchise. And going back and forth between Do-It-Yourself, I need help with an expert or here's all my stuff just do it for me is the cycle that we are seeing. We're actually pleased with what we're seeing. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah, thank you for your question, Daniel. In fact, I would share with you that the last couple of years, it's not been easy, because everybody is -- and I don't mean in our space, but everybody's actually trying to find ways to shift to a virtual world and the pandemic just simply accelerated. So, as we look ahead, we're not looking at headwinds, because we've actually been dealing with a market that's really going after these type of experts in multiple different industries. There's a couple of things that not only helps us retain our experts, but acquire more and this is, of course based on verbatims and talking to our experts. One, it's our culture, it is the way we treat employees, it's the benefits that we deliver. It's the overall employee experience that they have. And they're truly able to work virtually with the setup that they need and to do what they love, which is deliver for customers and not have to market their services. We are unique in that. We don't ask our experts to sell, we ask our experts to do one thing, which is deliver an awesome experience for our customers. We've had a quite high retention rate. We have been able to recruit the best of the best. And by the way, we actually have very high standards. We have what we call A for A process, which is assessing for awesome. They have to pass certain hurdles to be able to join us. We measure the recommendation scores. So there's a service standard that they have to be able to deliver against. And now we also provide certifications. And so we help them with education to get certified and to actually be able to grow their careers. So we really treat our experts like the way we would care for and treat employees, and that is I would say the differentiator beyond the course the benefits that we provide. Yeah, very welcome. Kartik, good to hear from you. I think without getting into the numbers, which again, we'll talk about more at Investor Day. The place I would start as Credit Karma, significantly during the pandemic reduced their marketing and really focus on the 100 million customers that they had to really focus on ensuring that they could manage through the pandemic, which is a lot of the reasons why we're seeing the type of bounce that we're seeing now, because they truly took good care of their customers during the pandemic. And really the big thrust is now we're starting to do marketing with Credit Karma not only within app, but also outside of the app, and 40% of the customers that came in or members that came in were all Intuit customers that chose Credit Karma. So, I would say in some ways, we're probably above pre-pandemic levels, and we're excited about the possibilities as we look ahead. It's a variety, Kartik. It comes down to confidence. Those customers that -- let me actually take a step back, out of the 86 million folks that use an assisted method based on our own research that we did several years ago, 70 million are willing to switch to a digital solution as long as they can have access to an expert. So really, these are folks that are choosing to use a digital platform, as long as they can get expert help and their needs could vary. So it's not just the simple filers, it's really an individual that chooses to use a digital platform with expertise. And so we're getting all kinds of variety of folks that are choosing to come to TurboTax Live, and not just TurboTax full service. You're very welcome. Yeah. Sure, Matt. Our strategy is unchanged. We want as many free customers as we can get for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. One, we want to serve those customers, but then, two, over time, as a life situation changes, they may have different tax needs. But now with Credit Karma, we have an opportunity to provide other benefits beyond taxes. So our strategy is unchanged. I would say, if I use this year particularly as an example, we have end to end focus on free, and particularly with TurboTax Live basic, where we got quite a bit of folks that came in, that were from the assisted category that we love, because ultimately, it's about transforming the assisted category. So, our strategy is unchanged. And the growth that we saw was really in line with what we would have expected. There are no restrictions with Credit Karma. As I mentioned earlier, we have one launched Credit Karma as a test as part of the TurboTax filing experience. And we have launched TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we ran 40 tests this year, just to learn to understand how we could really nail the experience. And we're going to be able to now given our learning scales to a different level, as we look at it, but there are no restrictions in terms of what we can and can't do. It's really all focused on the customer experience. Yeah, very welcome. Yeah. Sure, Brad. Thank you. First of all, our initial limit that we set just for the sake of focus and really nailing the experience has been small businesses that are between 10 to 100 employees. We are very pleased with our progress. We're continuing to build out the platform to be able to continue to move up market, even within that 10 to 100 employee segment. With that said, to your question, we don't believe that there's a limit other than what we don't want to do is serve the Intuit's of the world. We don't want to get into a place where we're serving a company the size of Intuit. And we don't want to get into a place where we get into professional services, and we're having to customize the platform. We want it to be something that we can scale, and that is durable. So, the limit will not stop at 100. We put that limit on ourselves to ensure that we can really nail the experience and be very intentional and focused around our scaling. And at the right time, of course, we'll communicate to you all when we choose to go beyond 100. But we believe that there's an opportunity beyond the segment that we serve today. Yeah, sure. We do and we're providing our own training and certification, because one of the things that's really exciting and unique about what we're doing is, we are going after a confidence problem for both consumers and small businesses. So as we recruit, we're not only recruiting to ensure that we have the right expertise that can deliver for customers need to get their taxes on, but also for small businesses that not only need advice, but need to get their quarterly taxes done. So in addition to hiring the best of the best, and looking at partners that are in the marketplace, we also are building our own capabilities around training and certification. So with both those dimensions, we feel really good about the type of skill that we'll be able to acquire and retain, but also how we can grow those skills. Yeah, very welcome. Great. Michael, thank you for your question. A couple of things. I would say, one, of course, we've provided guidance for the remainder of the year and we're very excited and pleased that we were able to raise our guidance. And we'll talk more at our Investor Day around guidance for not only FY '22, but one thing Michelle and I will do as we did last year is beyond guidance, just talk about our long-term expectation. So, I think I would say, let's wait till Investor Day to have the conversation beyond the fiscal year that we are in. In terms of TurboTax Live, we intentionally do not report the actual numbers in TurboTax Live other than just our growth rate. I would just reiterate that it is the fastest continues to be the fastest growing platform and products in the company. We're very pleased that it actually accelerated growth from last year on top of a very good year last year. And then majority of these customers are coming to us from the assisted category that are -- and one thing we're pleased about is, we had a growth of 100% of customers that are completely new to Intuit that came to TurboTax Live. So those are some of the stats and numbers that we've chosen to share publicly, and we'll look forward to sharing more at Investor Day. No, I wouldn't call it a wash at all. It's actually why we're able to grow our total pace base of customers year-after-year. So no, no it is not wash. And the metrics that I shared earlier, when you look the total number of IRS returns, our share of that total actually increased one point, which means that our base continues to increase. No, it is not a wash, it is an increase in share by Intuit. Thank you, Michael. Yeah. Great, Josh. Thank you. First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 36 million customers actually took us up on Credit Karma Money. I wish they did and our goal is they will over time, but I wanted to just make sure that that was clear. To the question that you asked, it's actually a great question, it gives me an opportunity to just very quickly paint a picture. And that is, I'll go back to what I shared earlier, which is the more we provide services and benefits to Credit Karma members, the more they will come back to the platform through our notifications, and the more they will engage with the services and the more we have an opportunity to actually present more products to them, and then over time, be able to monetize that to drive our revenue growth. So the power of Credit Karma Money is if you have a checking account, well, that's our savings account where you choose to take us off on direct payroll deposits, so we can give you early access to your paycheck. Not everything is necessarily about monetizing every single benefit, but the more we bring you back, the more than we can offer you, hey, Josh, we have a pre-approved credit card that's right for you, hey, Josh, it looks like you're paying ex for your auto insurance, we have an offer based on your driving habits to pay 20% less.  So it becomes truly the vision that I described earlier, which is a financial assistant in your pocket where we are in your corner, to try to help you reduce your debt and put more money in your pocket. So, we're not overly reliant on direct deposits by any means. But it just becomes another benefit and a reason to engage with the platform, which gives us opportunities to offer more products to you and then be able to monetize. To your last question about M&A, our principles around M&A are steadfast. We, of course have just based on some of the acquisitions we've made in the last several years and how well they've done we have a lot more confidence in our ability to execute, because we truly studied our history in the last 10-years, what went well, what didn't go well. And that's informed, I mean, a lot of our approaches today. And really it for us, everything is about speed to market. And so if there is talent we need to acquire, technology we need to acquire or capability like Credit Karma, those principles were informed decisions. And of course, our confidence has continued to grow, given the execution of the recent acquisitions. Very welcome. Yes, I'll be very brief. Thank you for your wonderful questions. And again, I want to thank our Intuit team and all of our partners for everything that they're doing to innovate for our customers. And we look forward to talking to you at our next earnings. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Second quarter results reflect strong momentum across the company. Small Business and Self-Employed Group grew double digits. Credit Karma performed very well and we are encouraged by our early results this tax season. We are on track for Intuit to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. We are confident our game plan to win is durable, accelerated by digital tailwinds given the pandemic. Our platform is well positioned to help customers take advantage of a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omni-channel capabilities, and new ways to reduce debt and save money. The velocity of our innovation is helping our customers at a time when they need us most, and positions us to accelerate growth in light of these structural and behavioral changes. We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3rd, and welcomed 1,300 Credit Karma employees to the Intuit family. We bring together a large customer base of 110 million Credit Karma members and 57 million Intuit customers to help them unlock smart money decisions. Credit Karma\u2019s data platform creates powerful network effects through personalized financial offers \u2013 benefitting members and partners \u2013 while adding a new monetization engine to Intuit. We are off and running executing on our innovation roadmap which I will touch on shortly. Since we\u2019re in the middle of tax season, let\u2019s start there. We are very confident in our strategy and momentum extending our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. We are making great progress serving fast growing underpenetrated Latinx, self-employed and investor segments. This season, we also expanded our free eligibility to better serve customers receiving unemployment benefits. We continue to aggressively transform the assisted segment by reshaping how 86 million filers can get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. We feel great about how the season is progressing. Let me now shift to our Big Bets. We are seeing strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the business with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face, and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I will highlight our progress, covering Big Bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We are solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we are transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 86 million filers, the opportunity to access tax experts on our platform. We continue to lead the way in shaping the category, helping customers understand how they can get their taxes done in a new way with our marketing campaigns and for a limited time, offering free Live expertise to filers with very simple returns to attract them into the category. We have significantly improved the TurboTax Live platform by making it easier for customers to access an expert throughout the filing experience, and now with our innovative full service offering, our customers can hand-off their return to an expert who will prepare it and file it for them. We continue to make progress with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. Entering our second peak season with QuickBooks Live, our customer base has doubled from a year ago and retention rates are improving. Although it\u2019s early days for QuickBooks Live, we are confident in the long-term opportunity to penetrate non-consumption. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We are making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. Our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals, focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. As we make personalized financial offers to customers across our platform, Credit Karma provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. We\u2019ve made great initial progress combining our capabilities to fuel success of the Credit Karma platform. First, to create a complete financial profile for existing and prospective members, with customer consent, we combined income data from 26 million TurboTax returns with Credit Karma. The combination of verified income data with credit history will enable Credit Karma to better personalize offers, driving engagement and creating a win-win-win for our members, partners and us over time. This enables us to grow in our core verticals for credit cards and personal loans and growth verticals for insurance and mortgages. Second, we integrated Credit Karma Money into the TurboTax filing experience, providing approximately 36 million TurboTax customers ability to deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into a no-fee checking account. And third, we are migrating Turbo users to Credit Karma. We are excited about the journey ahead of us. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are innovating with velocity to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We are making it even easier for customers to get paid fast with tools like payment-enabled invoices, by auto-enabling new customers to accept payments immediately, increasing our charge volume. We continue to innovate with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital by providing visibility into their full financial picture, along with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them. Now taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks, we integrated Bill Pay into the offering this quarter. We are seeing growing adoption and active use of QuickBooks Cash, including a meaningful increase in activation rates. We are making good progress with QuickBooks Commerce, launched last September. QuickBooks Commerce is designed to better serve the 1 million product-based businesses on our platform and 6.4 million product-based businesses in our core markets. The offering provides inventory and order management tools small businesses need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. We continue to add new partner integrations, enabling a streamlined experience. We\u2019re further bolstering the offering with the acquisition of OneSaas in early February. OneSaas is an infrastructure platform that integrates data streams from multiple sources of e-commerce platforms. This will help our customers see a complete view in QuickBooks. It\u2019s still early for both QuickBooks Cash and QuickBooks Commerce, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The features we are introducing individually tailor the offering to the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We continue to build out the offering and innovate to better serve these mid-market small business customers, by adding more deeply integrated partners, important to both acquisition and retention. And finally, our first big bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, enables us to put more money in our customers\u2019 pockets, eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. In TurboTax, we\u2019re leveraging advanced models to proactively offer customers the right resources at the right time to keep them engaged and give them confidence to file their taxes. And in QuickBooks Advanced, we\u2019re using AI to detect anomalies in price and quantity on customer invoices, saving our customers time and the frustration of having to resend an invoice. Our Live offerings are benefiting from a common AI platform that is creating efficiencies at scale, driving profitable growth. Across all of our big bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us, and I\u2019m proud of the progress we are making as a team. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $384 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.07, versus $0.91 a year ago. The GAAP earnings include a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68, versus $1.16 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue declined 71% in Q2, driven by the later IRS opening this year. We continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 9% to 10% growth in fiscal 2021. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue declined 8% in Q2, reflecting a delay in forms availability. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 11% during the quarter, while Online Ecosystem revenue was up 22%. Our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater online ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 22% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by customer growth and mix-shift. We lapped a full quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital grew 20% in fiscal Q2. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix-shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue grew 44%. The slower growth from last quarter was driven by lapping price increases a year ago, and the lingering impact from lower retention and customer acquisition at the beginning of the pandemic. Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined 2% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations for the business to decline longer-term. Within this, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Small businesses are resilient, and we continue to help them put more money in their pockets when they need it most. We are pleased to see most QuickBooks indicators are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. This includes growth in customer acquisition, the number of companies running payroll and payments charge volume. This reinforces the digital tailwinds and positioning of our platform and Big Bets Sasan touched on earlier. We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3rd, resulting in revenue of $144 million for the partial quarter. Our strategic focus with Credit Karma is to grow the core of credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals such as home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals, focused on money innovation including savings and checking accounts. I\u2019ll share more detail on each of these strategic focus areas. First, our focus is growing the core. We are seeing new credit card and personal loan partners onboarding while overall partner activity continues to recover. Adoption of the industry-first Lightbox continues to grow. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to more tightly integrate with its financial partners which helps match members to the products that are right for them. This now represents approximately 40% of credit card transactions and approximately 30% of personal loan transactions, up substantially year-over-year. Second, our focus is expanding growth verticals. Although it's early days, we're seeing strong growth in auto insurance followed by home loans and then auto loans, January revenue in the growth vertical is up over 1.5 times year-over-year, it's a high watermark. During the quarter, we introduced Karma Drive providing members an easy opportunity to qualify for an auto insurance discount based on actual driving habits. Third, our focus is developing emerging verticals, particularly money innovation, and we're just getting started with Credit Karma money. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue, double-digits and growing, operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we're starting to see the opportunity for faster margin expansion over time. And I'm proud of the progress that team is making. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate and opportunities that yield an expected return on investments greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities, with an emphasis of becoming an AI driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priorities at cash regenerate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we repurchased $175 million of stock during the second quarter. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable April 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, while macro uncertainty continues, we remain confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 53% to 55%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.85 to $5.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.75 $6.85. You can find our full Q3 and reiterated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great, thanks Michelle. I'm very proud of our team and all we've accomplished together and I'm very optimistic about the future. So with that said, let's now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much, good afternoon. I'm going to ask on tax since we're in that season. And I'm just very curious on, if you're seeing any activity pick up from all the new brokerage accounts opened in 2020, if you're seeing a lot of activity in your Tops business from corresponding tax reporting from that. And just Sasan, a few thoughts on that, is that going to trigger more volume or do you think it's more likely something that will trigger an increase in the revenue per return since such transactions might come in at a higher tier of offering. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you for your question, Scott. If I would take you back to what we declared several years ago, one element was under-penetrated segments. The investment community was one, of course Self-Employed and Latinx. And the other element of course is about transforming the assistant segment, which also helps us serve that community. Well, if they need expertise or if they want us to do their taxes for them. And what I would tell you, we all see the same stats, there is then really a significant increase in retail investors using all the different tools that are out there and not just in the United States, but particularly in Brazil, India, and the U.S. And, so I feel good that we're very well positioned. And all of those segments that I mentioned, Latinx Self-Employed and Premier, we are actually experiencing the kind of growth that we expected and probably, a kick-up on our Premier offering, which really serves our investment community. So we are experiencing an accelerated growth and it's really all sort of in context of what we had declared, and we'll have to see how the season plays out when we tally up our results, what it all looks like, but we're very, very pleased with the fact that we really positioned ourselves to serve the segment a few years ago. And I think we're positioned well for delivering for them this season, both with live platform and if you want to do it yourself.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. I appreciate that, Sasan. And then staying on taxes, I'm just curious, kind of a high-level question, and you get this throughout the preseason, but now we're into the tax season. What type of February returns do you expect this year versus last year? I saw recently that Texas, because of what's gone on there in the last couple of weeks has gotten into way to June 25. So with that into account, and then just the warm tax season last year a condense for most States tax season this year, what are you expecting just for an industry growth year-over-year and anything that you're seeing in the early season to support that view? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. A couple of things, I would say, one, the assumptions that we made coming into this tax season is that IRS returns would be sort of flattish and we expect to be able to grow our share of the total number of returns, and particularly because of our focus on the under-penetrated segments that I mentioned and transforming the assistance segment with our live platforms, really for us, it's about growing our share of the entire category and as, we have such a massive opportunity with $86 million filers that today go to somebody else to do their taxes. And the fact that we have an opportunity to help them get their taxes on with the expert at their fingertips with any time that they needed. So really our role is about growing the category and in context of a flattish IRS returns. All of our guidance, just \u2013 we made the assumption that is April 15 finished, we contemplated the Taxes announcement that was made yesterday, we\u2019re really just looking at past situations where there is been a disaster where IRS has extended the filing date. The behaviors are very different net-net, we feel very good about our progress, we feel very good about our momentum and really good about the potential that we have this season and the context of the guidance that we provided.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you. Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your question, please.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question. The first one for you Sasan also on tax, as you think about TurboTax full service, I\u2019m not sure if you guys are starting to see some good traction there, but we'd love to get a sense of what kind of customers you're seeing, utilize that particular product, is it guys coming from accountants? Is it kind of net new filers who may have the greatest level of uncertainty? Is this across the board? Any color you can give would be fantastic.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Ken. Good to hear from you. It's important just to remind ourselves that we're \u2013 in the assistant segment, the biggest problem that we're solving is competence. These $86 million filers need to know that they can ask a question from an expert at any time that they need to and have the ability to turn over their return if they so choose. And we are getting very good traction with full service, but it really plays, I would say, a Halo effect. What customers want to know is that, they can come in and if they choose to ask for help that they can get it, and somewhere in the experience, if they choose to just say here, let me give you all of my documents digitally that we can do it for them, or even if they choose to make that choice upfront. So full service beyond the actual number of customers that will end up using full service really is playing a Halo effect, which is what we learned in our test results last year, it really builds confidence for filers that are coming from the assisted category that I can get my questions answered, there's always going to be an expert at my side. And as a reminder last year, we experienced 70%-plus growth in TurboTax Live, and a majority of those customers actually came from the assisted category. So it's playing the role exactly as we had assumed that it would. And so far so good this season in terms of the traction that we\u2019re getting.\nKen Wong: Great, great. That's super helpful. And then a quick one for you, Michelle. You touched on Lightbox and seeing I think 40% of transaction, 30% of personal loans. Just wondering kind of where do you think those numbers could trend up to? And then as far as monetization, any color on kind of how monetization has improved for customers that are utilizing Lightbox?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey, Ken, thanks for the question here. Lightbox is a great technology that really is \u2013 enables us to have a winning experience for both the customer and for our partners, our financial institution partners, as well as us. There is nothing more frustrating than for a customer to come in and not be able to get access to a financial product that they thought they would. And so, it enables the financial institutions to be able to better target the products that they have and then customers are much more likely to actually be approved. So with the metrics that we have right now, we'll have to see how those trends over time, we're very excited about it, we want to continue to have more and more transactions go through Lightbox, because as we said, it's a better experience for the customer and it also is a better experience for our partners.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Sasan, we heard from Michelle's comments that many of the small business indicators, such as customer acquisition, number of companies running payroll, payments, charge, volumes, things like that are all trending positively. Can you maybe expand it a little bit more on the indicators that they're looking at in terms of small business health and from your perspective kind of where we are in terms of small business recovery?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Let me start Brad with the actual recovery, depending on the geography United States versus UK or different States within the U.S., every geography is performing differently. And just to use an example, we've got places like Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, but have actually recovered quite nicely. And then you have places like Michigan and Washington, California and New York that are lagging. And then within that, you have industries that have come back all the way and industries that haven't. It\u2019s the natural ones that you would assume, it's fitness, restaurants, travel. I\u2019d bring that up in context of yet another data point, which is when we look across the data points that we see about a 25% of our customers, their net dollars in their bank account is down nearly 50%. So I give you those data points just to say that small businesses are still working hard to come back to where they were, and they're not all the way back. That's really important context relative to how our trends are doing. And what you heard from Michelle, which is, we watch acquisition, we watch retention, of course we watch our payments charge volume, the number of companies running payroll, the number of employees per company using payroll time tracking et cetera. And all of those indicators are at or above pre-COVID levels except the number of employees at small businesses. And that really tells you a lot about just the innovation that's happening on our platform, the power of our platform, and the fact that in times where small businesses are actually doing worse than they were prior to COVID are actually platform metrics are at or better than pre-COVID. And so that actually really bodes well for us to not only deliver for our customers, but the growth rates that we would expect as we look ahead. So good momentum and actually bullish about where we are in the opportunities for the future.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks, Sasan. That's very helpful. And maybe just to follow one for Michelle, Credit Karma is off to a really strong start, and you're now just migrating Turbo users over, and you've got so many growth opportunities ahead that you've talked about in your remarks. Can you just remind us perhaps of the seasonality of this business, because if we just start annualizing the last two months, I think we'd all be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves, what should we keep in mind relative to what we've seen out of the gate versus what you're guiding for the full year?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes. Thank you, Brad. Good question. We are off to a strong start with Credit Karma, feel good about the progress that they're making. We're seeing the business bounce back more quickly from the pandemic than we had expected, not all the way back to pre-COVID levels, but definitely making progress there. When you think about seasonality in the business, they do see a little bit stronger in the January, February time period, but there isn't a huge seasonality in the business. But I would say in January, February is a little bit more of an uptick. As people are coming into the new year and some of those new resolutions and so forth, but that's what I would say you guys should expect.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to expand a little bit on Brad Zelnick\u2019s question. Can you help us understand now that the indicators are at or above kind of like the pre-crisis levels, how should we think about the mechanism of how those indicators and the timeframe for when those indicators will translate into kind of the revenue growth rates that you guys have got it to longer-term and that we're expecting. So like how should we moderate our expectations on to how quickly do indicators become sort of the actuality in terms of what we see on the income statement?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, thanks for your question, Keith. And in context of being a subscription business, a lot of the growth rate we're experiencing now is the things that were happening almost a year ago this time. And in context of slower acquisition, retention, dropping a couple of points starting in March of last year. And also, there are a number of things that have huge benefit for customers that we paused, things like payroll full-service, migration, we have a line for where you have to upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced we sort of dropped that line for a while. So it was the combination of acquisition or retention along with very intentional decisions we made around pricing and migration that has had an impact on the growth rates that we're seeing now. And in addition to all of that, we're lapping price increases that we had done the same time last year. So the long answer to your short question is, what we are starting to see now, we should expect the growth rates to be impacted in the year ahead, because a lot of the metrics and the trends that we're experiencing now, we'll see the follow-on benefits in the quarters ahead. But I would say almost think about a year out or so is the way \u2013 is the best way to think about it.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Got it. And if I could ask a follow up to Michelle on the margin side of the equation, really appreciate the continued kind of balance between good growth and faster margin expansion over time. Great to see that as part of the corporate philosophy. This quarter in particular we saw the SMB contribution margin up nicely on a year-on-year basis. But I know a lot of companies are talking to us about kind of one-time items or sort of crisis related expense savings that we saw in the year past that might not sustained the year forward. Anything we should be aware of in terms of sort of expenses that might come on board that could upset or not upset, but could temporarily sort of reverse the margin expansion that we've been seeing?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks for the question Keith, first of all. For us as we've been thinking about margins and margin expansion, really the biggest driver of any of that is us becoming more and more of an AI driven expert platform. And so you may see some expenses here, there, and obviously you see margins move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But I would say really focus on our guidance, which is after last year expanding margins a point. This year we expect margins to expand approximately 110 basis points, once you're excluding Credit Karma. And that is really us continuing to evolve, to being more of a platform company and seeing those areas for us to drive margin expansion across the company everything from technology to customer success to go to market. And so that is the biggest driver of margin expansion for us across the company.\nKeith Weiss: That\u2019s it. Thank you so much guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi guys. I think in some of the prepared remarks and press release, there was the talk of the cross-sell of TurboTax going to Credit Karma, but I'm wondering what the expectations are in terms of the cross-sell and marketing that you could do to Credit Karma users for TurboTax for this tax season?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure, Sterling. Let me just if I could take it up one notch and I'll come back specifically to answer your question. There are a number of things that we have launched. We've launched Credit Karma Money at the end of the TurboTax experience where migrating, Turbo customers that with Turbo being deprecated to Credit Karma. And of course then, to your question launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. So there are a number of big things that we're doing and all of them Sterling, I would think about them as long-term opportunities with our focus being testing and experimenting right now to really nail the experience. So I wouldn't expect a really big impacts from those in the near term, but we do expect these to deliver significant customer benefit and growth in the future, because we're really just testing and experimental and really nailed experience before we launch things at scale. So hopefully that answers your question.\nSterling Auty: It does. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. Sasan, on the Analyst Day, you talked about a $24 billion U.S. tax opportunity. And I'm wondering what have you learned from live? And what are the things that that you need to add to live in terms of capabilities, to be able to address this in a larger scale. And also in the same vein as you look at QBO advanced, what are the things that you've learned with that product out at the higher end of the SMB market that you've traditionally played in? And what are the things that you've looking to introduce in the product to make it address the full breadth of the TAM? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Kash. Let me hear from you. Let me start with live and the 86 million customers that today go to an assisted method. Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million customers are actually willing to use a digital platform as long as they can get a health and expertise to be able to file their taxes with confidence. And in fact, they would like to get help beyond taxes, which is where Credit Karma comes in. And so to your question of what we have learned with our beginning our fourth year with the live platform, we're more bullish about the opportunity ahead of us than we were even four years ago when we launched TurboTax live. Because in essence, what we've learned and that's informing what we're executing this season is one, we have 86 million folks that we need to get to consider the fact that there's a digital platform with an expert at their fingertips. And the fact that they can actually hand everything off digitally for an expert, which is where you see what we're doing in our marketing campaigns. And you may only see what we're doing off air on TV, but we've got an incredible campaign in educating our customers in multiple different digital channels to help them understand how this works, because we're really shaping and reshaping the category. So one is about education which is where a lot of our investment is going. The second is when they come in, really nailing the first-time use. Immediately when they come in, to help them understand how to get access to an expert, engaging with an expert, exchanging a document visually and seeing how easy it is. And then with now the launch of full service, if you choose to upgrade the full service or you come in and choose full service, how do we deliver instant benefits. Instant benefit by the way is confidence that there's an expert there. Now, which gets me to the other side of the equation, which I haven't mentioned, and that is our expert platform. That's really where we have advantage. A lot of our AI investments are actually improving our expert platform around scheduling, document exchange, making sure that we connect the right expert to the right customer. Ensuring that we deliver insights to the expert because of our machine learning capabilities, so that when the expert is talking to the customer it actually, they deliver confidence with their know-how and their knowledge, and then being able to, by the way the culture we're creating with the experts that we have on our platform that love the input culture or the income that they make and love the fact that they get to deliver for our customers in the comfort of their home. So those are the areas that we are focused on. And frankly, every day in the season we learned and we adjust and we love our momentum and the opportunities ahead. And what we'll learn over time is we're launching TurboTax Live as part of the Credit Karma platform. And what's unique in launching that as part of the Credit Karma platform is we'll actually be able to deliver a personalized experience because we'll know that you were a prior-year assisted customer. And that again will pay off in the long-term, but those are the things that we're testing now. In terms of your question around disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced is a couple of things that we've learned. Frankly, we believe that we can even go higher in the market beyond 10 to a 100 employees. Now, our focus right now is 10 to 100 employees, but as we see the power of our platform and the ability for it to scale, we believe that we can actually serve even bigger mid-market customers at a disruptive price. And to your question, the things that we're continuing to add are things around like workflow management, automated invoice approvals batch in the saying, getting very deep integrations of critical apps that these customers need to be able to grow their business and run their business, some of which Michelle actually mentioned in the script around like DocuSign, HubSpot, Salesforce just a few example. And every day we're learning what we need to add to the platform, but it's a lot of what we do today, just a much, much higher scale. And the confidence has given us is not only being able to go up market, but we're actually \u2013 we have now 70% of the customers that we're getting are upgraders and 30% that are new to the franchise. And we're actually seeing our new to the franchise growing even at a faster rate than what we thought without the focus yet in place to be able to go after new to the franchise. So those are the few elements that I think are worth sharing Kash.\nKash Rangan: Very insightful. Thank you so much, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon, back on small business. I just wanted to drill and there were a handful of investor questions related to your comments around the pipeline yet Q1 to Q2, the growth rate is decelerating small business. I think many believe that they would stabilize or build, and I just want to make sure we're truly understanding this bet, I mean the comments, the color that you're seeing in the pipeline and close rates, and things behind the scenes are showing a much better growth rate than what that reported number is indicating. And I just want to make sure if there's any anomalies or any differences that investors should be aware of. There's a number of questions just disconnect from the comment relative to the reported number. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure, Brent. One of the things that we've been pretty consistent in communicating is that our growth rates would decline sequentially before they start bouncing and going back up. And that's really what we saw in Q2. It is very consistent with what we expected. And it's consistent with what we expected on a couple of fronts. One, because this time last year or starting in March for several months both acquisition slowed, but also our attrition popped, but in addition to that, there are things that as I mentioned a few moments ago that we paused, like full service migration, we paused our QuickBooks Advanced lineup for those upgraders. We didn't ask them to move up because we didn't want to have them experience that in the early COVID times. And so what we're experiencing now is just a reflection of some of those key indicators that we experienced earlier in the year. And we are on top of that lapping a price increase that we did last year that we didn't do this year. So you've put all of that together. We're actually quite pleased with the growth rates that we experienced in the quarter. Although we expected it to be lower than the last quarter. And then as we look ahead, as I mentioned in the coming quarters and year ahead, a lot of the indicators that Michelle and I shared will start turning into revenue growth, but everything is per our expectation. I think the only thing that's not per our expectation is the business is actually performing better than what we thought in the pandemic and therefore we're bullish about the future.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome, Brent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI, your question please.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much. Actually Sasan, I wanted to actually \u2013 maybe it\u2019s for Michelle, just to per Brent's question, didn't you get four points of benefit from the PPP program last quarter in your 24%. So if we sort of normalize and I guess, did you have any this quarter, because if you normalize for that, you would actually have accelerated from doing the math right from 2022 this quarter. So I guess just keep talking about the PPP program helped the QBO ecosystem at all this quarter?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, I would headline, but I would say \u2013 Michelle, please go ahead.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: No, that's okay. I was just going to say, Kirk actually the PPP revenue that we got that was actually in Q4 we saw that. And so we did have about a four point decline, if my memory serves me correctly, 28% Online Ecosystem revenue growth in Q4, which then dropped to 24% in Q1 and that actually had a PPP in it, but we didn't have anything material in Q1.\nKirk Materne: Okay. That's fine I just wanted to double check that. But Sasan, I guess just sort of on the small business, another question would be on the international growth. Clearly the UK was under a pretty severe lockdown for a lot of this quarter. Did that impact you all at all? I guess international growth is still very strong in the mid-40%. But I was just kind of curious if that was one of the regions that perhaps it was still, maybe taking a little bit longer time to recover. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Kirk it actually has. I mean, I would say if I look at it across the globe, the United States has really not just bounced back nicely, but just the resiliency of our platform. The innovation on the platform is really allowing us to see all the indicators get back to or better than pre-COVID levels. When we look at outside of the United States, countries like UK, Australia, France actually were hit much harder and to your point, they are still, specifically in UK and France in a lockdown so that has impacted the growth rate relative to what we see in the United States. But all of that is within the context of the guidance that we have provided, it has seen a hit.\nKirk Materne: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you all.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Thanks and good afternoon. Going back to Credit Karma, it looks like that segment outperform what we were expecting on the partial quarter. Looking at what\u2019s implied for the rest of the year. It looks like it\u2019s still below the billion dollars that businesses at in 2019. Can we just go back to what some of the factors are that could drive outperformance from that beyond what\u2019s assumed in your current outlook. And then on the margin there is the 26% segment margin, they\u2019re a good building block for us to be thinking about or is the seasonality Michelle referenced somewhat impacting that number as well?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Good to hear from you, Michael. Just as a quick refresher, there are three elements around growth in Credit Karma. It\u2019s going to core, which is credit cards and personal loans. It\u2019s expanding our growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance. And then emerging verticals, which is really all around assets, which is money innovation. And none of this is really coming from the third bucket. And the second point I would make is, we sort of have a 75-25, about 75% of the revenue is coming from in the credit cards and personal loans and 25% coming from the growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance, which is actually really improved versus about a year ago, where it was 95% at credit cards and personal loans. And specifically, would that context to answer your question. We\u2019re seeing more partners come back on the platform, we\u2019re seeing new partners come on, we\u2019re starting to see higher spend and because of just the innovation with LightBox and does better matching, we\u2019re getting more customers to actually get connected to the financial products that are right for them and partners are benefiting from it. So the performance we experienced this quarter is just we\u2019re seeing stronger momentum, when it comes to credit cards, personal loans and then the growth vertical specifically around auto insurance. And when we \u2013 look ahead, our overall guidance was just based on the trajectory that we assume for the year, and we\u2019ll just have to continue to see how these verticals play out, but we liked the momentum that we see, but that could be the reason in the long-term for over performance to your question. Specifically around margin, it really important to note that one, we manage margins at the company level. And so really pay attention to the guidance that we provided the company level. Two, we are investing in Credit Karma. It is a \u2013 we see it in the long-term as a big growth engine for the company. The penetration, when you think about the 110 million members that Credit Karma has the penetration with all these different financial products that I mentioned, it\u2019s actually still quite low. So it\u2019s actually quite exciting, as we look ahead the possibilities of increasing penetration. So we are investing dollars in Credit Karma, all within the context of the guidance and margin expansion guidelines that we have provided. So I wouldn\u2019t get too anchored on the current quarter margin rates. It was more because it performed better than what we thought and some of the investments and hiring shifted between quarters. I would more focus on company level operating income that we provided and margin rates that we provided.\nMichael Turrin: That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your line is open.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you. Just first one quick clarification from me relative to the question that Kirk asked earlier. Michelle, you\u2019ve clarified that, Q4 had the PPP impact and by Q1 there wasn\u2019t one. But given that, that program reopened, I think in earlier this calendar year, can you just confirm whether there was an impacting Q2?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: No, Jen. That program \u2013 the new PPP program has been moving, you may have seen it in the process and moving much more slowly than anyone had anticipated, and now we don\u2019t have anything in that material on that Q2 results.\nJennifer Lowe: Perfect. And then it just pulling on some of the questions around the trajectory in small business, there\u2019s a couple of different factors that you called out. There\u2019s first, the fact that, the economic indicators have improved, but maybe not, everything is back to pre-COVID levels. And then there\u2019s also sort of this lagging effect from some of the subscription businesses or some of the pauses that you took as everyone sort of navigated a very uncertain time. So I just want to clarify if you think about the 30%-plus type aspirations for the online ecosystem component. Is that something you can get back to in the current environment? And it\u2019s just a function of working through some of these sort of leftover impacts from the last six to 12 months. Or do you need to see continued improvement in the broader small business economy as well, to get back to pre-pandemic levels to support that 30%? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Jen. Thanks for your question. What I would say is, the economic indicators are still below pre-COVID levels. It\u2019s more our own indicators and the performance of our platform that has bounced back and in many cases better than the pre-COVID levels, which gets I think the essence of your question, and that is, our goal in the long-term has not changed. We believe that we will get this business specifically, the online revenue growth back above 30% and we just need to keep executing our game plan. And I would tell you that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s heavily relied upon how the economy bounces back, because if you look at where we are today versus six months ago, a lot of the performance that we are talking about is based on the performance of the platform at our execution and the innovation on our platform. Now, at the end of the day, this economy does need a stimulus \u2013 fiscal stimulus to get people back into jobs, but that is not the anchor for us to get back to the growth rates that we believe we could get back to it. It\u2019ll just take some time.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question, please.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, Sasan. When you look at the QuickBooks business, obviously, you\u2019re lapping a price increase, but you haven\u2019t stopped innovation. I\u2019m wondering what metrics you\u2019ll look at to feel comfortable to adjust pricing.\nSasan Goodarzi: Kartik, thank you for your question. Our main focus around pricing will be, when we believe it\u2019s the right time given how small businesses are performing and given the pandemic. It is actually not related to our innovation, but as you know, we now have innovation that allows us to go up market with both QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live, which is a much higher ARPU offering. We have the ability at the garner higher price from customers, but from a price increase perspective, it\u2019s less about the metrics and indicators that we see with our own platform, but more when we believe is the right time to raise prices with customers given, what they\u2019re experiencing and the challenges that they\u2019re experiencing for their business. So the two are in many ways unrelated in terms of the way we think about it.\nKartik Mehta: And then just finally, when you look at the Credit Karma customers as far as tax customers is the mix of the products they\u2019re using different than the core TurboTax customers, please, what you\u2019re seeing early on.\nSasan Goodarzi: What I would share with you that we\u2019ve learned about the Credit Karma base as a big portion of their customers actually use an assisted method. And that is actually what is exciting to us now. Because they have 110 million members, you can imagine that a strong cross section of folks in the U.S., whether Latin ex, self-employed those that are retail investors. So that cross section is generally consistent with the customers we serve in TurboTax today. What different is, we\u2019ve got a good majority of those customers that in the prior year used an assisted method.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Wanting to ask about the feedback you got from that product based businesses, mainly, QuickBooks Commerce that you launched few months back that seems like that\u2019s an acquisition from TradeGecko mainly has order inventory. I\u2019m wondering, like, how far you can expand that offering, it feels like you can become the back-office platform for this kind of businesses. So what sort of opportunity you are seeing and what sort of feedback you got so far.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Thank you, Siti. First of all, we\u2019re very excited about QuickBooks Commerce and it\u2019s also very, very early innings with QuickBooks Commerce. And the acquisition we just made with OneSaas actually allows us to bring data into the platform from marketplaces, from POS providers, from fulfillment apps. And so it really actually helps us \u2013 help the customer understand how they're doing and their profitability, which is what\u2019s most important to the customers. We actually had to restrict the top of the funnel to ensure that we can nail the customer experience. And so our focus first was ensuring that we can serve new customers that don't use our inventory today. Our next focus will be existing QBO customers that don't use any of our inventory capabilities. And then third will be existing QBO customers that actually do use our inventory capabilities. And the reason that's important is we want to ensure that if a customer already has inventory, that we can easily sync all the product catalogs and their product numbers, and to keep their books clean. So net-net, we're just getting started. We had to restrict the top of the funnel because of the demand and the excitement that was out there because we want to be very intentional in terms of building out the capability. Very early indicators are positive with the number of customers that we have on our platform. But again, think about QuickBooks Commerce, think about QuickBooks Cash as these are long-term plays in terms of when and how they will deliver growth, but so far we're bullish about the early indicators.\nSiti Panigrahi: That's great. Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right. Thank you, Siti.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Michelle, as we think about free cash flow generation overtime, is there any reason that shouldn't closely mirror operating income growth?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that, Brad? I didn't hear the last part of it.\nBrad Reback: Sure. As we think about free cash flow generation overtime, is there any reason that shouldn't mirror operating income growth?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: No. No. There shouldn't be any real big reason why you shouldn't see that. No.\nBrad Reback: Okay. That's great. And then maybe one quick tactical one, Sasan. You talked about QuickBooks Live retention getting better. Is that meaningfully different than QuickBooks Online retention right now?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. The biggest thing, well, first of all, it's very early days. So we look at more cohort of customers versus the aggregate numbers. The biggest reason we're so focused on retention right now with QuickBooks Live is we're focused on understanding customer needs and really nailing the experience, because QuickBooks Live there are customers that come in to get set up. There are customers that come in that want us to provide them advice. And they're just \u2013 they're looking for bookkeeping advice and there are our customers actually want us to do their taxes for them and run their books for them. And what we're really being intentional about is understanding what are the needs, what are the experience that we need to deliver? And what does that look like on the platform, which is why you heard me mention retention. Retention right now is more focused on cohorts. And it is a lower than QBO only because we're looking at different cohorts of customers and their needs are very different. And before we really open up the top of the funnel, we want to make sure that every customer loves the experience that they're getting from us on QuickBooks Live and the team is just innovating like crazy to close some of the gaps in. So we're excited about the possibilities.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nArvind Ramnani: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on a question that was asked earlier around kind of the increase in brokerage accounts. And I just wanted to ask what potential lift from crypto users, this would be the first time these users will need to do some of them \u2013 will be first-time filers, but many of them will certainly be adding the \u2013 kind of the added product for capital gains or losses. Are you seeing any kind of lift from this segment of users?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Arvind, it's not particularly just from the crypto users, we're just \u2013 there are just millions more of customers that are doing their own trading in the U.S. and outside of the United States. And come tax time, they need to be able to do their taxes. And so we're just seeing increase in our Premier product, both with live, because if you need assistance, you can use live. And if you want to Do-It-Yourself, you'd just use force our [ph] Premier Do-It-Yourself product. So we're seeing an overall increase based on an increase in retail investing. I think call out something that's material on the crypto side.\nArvind Ramnani: Great. Great. And when you think about the kind of the lift in revenues, I mean, I'm not looking for a specific quantification, but directionally, are you expecting more of a lift from increased ARPU or increased users?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. The way we designed our long-term growth rates is under-penetrated segments, which is investment community, self-employed and Latinx and its TurboTax Live. And with TurboTax Live, just by design, it has a higher ARPU. Now \u2013 right now we are so early in the shaping of the category and being able to acquire our customers that the best thing for you all to anchor on is what we shared at Investor Day, which is our long-term expectations just on the tax side is 8% to 12%. And probably the largest driver of the higher end is ARPU. And just know that we're being very intentional about right now, raising awareness close with our campaigns, but the free expertise that we're providing for those that have very simple returns, just to create awareness in the category, but in the long-term, it's ARPU because of the assistant segment.\nArvind Ramnani: Perfect. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Millman: Thank you very much. A couple of questions. You talked \u2013 you mentioned that Credit Karma was getting some business from assisted. Can you talk about if that normal switching around between different methods or if this is particularly a Credit Karma-type business activity. Secondly, can you talk about and maybe you do this, whether you can use RALs to kind of speed up some of this movement, particularly from assisted and I guess let's talk with those.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure Michael, thank you for your question. The point I made earlier was twofold. One that this is a learning year for us in launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we're just running a lot of experiments to make sure that we can deliver a fantastic experience before we go big in the out years. But the second comment that I made is that that a good portion, we've not divulged the number of Credit Karma members use the assisted segment. And it's very much connected to when you look at there's $155 million or $160 million IRS returns, $86 million are in the assistant segment, proportionality is the same thing within the Credit Karma base. So that's the point that I was making earlier. To your second question about RALs, really the biggest driver of getting a customer to use a digital platform is actually confidence, not early access to their money. They have to first have confidence that they can get their taxes done right with you, which is where our experts and expertise comes in. And that's really where a lot of our investments are going. We also provide early access to your refund, but really the big driver is about ensuring that we deliver confidence to our experts.\nMichael Millman: Do you see big opportunity added money to move with confidence over to eliminating RAL kind of money?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, first of all, we're really focused on getting these customers to come to our platform by ensuring that they know that they can get access to an expert. So confidence is first and foremost, and of course our different methods that we can help these customers get early access to the refund. That's very, very consumer friendly. So the answer is yes, but it's secondary to providing expertise to these customers to use the platform.\nMichael Millman: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right, Michael.\nMichael Millman: And stay safe.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you so much. Thank you. You do the same.\nSasan Goodarzi: And thank you everybody. I know we ran a little bit over. I appreciate everyone's questions. I wish everyone well stay safe until next time. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $384 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.07, versus $0.91 a year ago. The GAAP earnings include a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68, versus $1.16 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue declined 71% in Q2, driven by the later IRS opening this year. We continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 9% to 10% growth in fiscal 2021. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue declined 8% in Q2, reflecting a delay in forms availability. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 11% during the quarter, while Online Ecosystem revenue was up 22%. Our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater online ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 22% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by customer growth and mix-shift. We lapped a full quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital grew 20% in fiscal Q2. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix-shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue grew 44%. The slower growth from last quarter was driven by lapping price increases a year ago, and the lingering impact from lower retention and customer acquisition at the beginning of the pandemic. Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined 2% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations for the business to decline longer-term. Within this, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Small businesses are resilient, and we continue to help them put more money in their pockets when they need it most. We are pleased to see most QuickBooks indicators are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. This includes growth in customer acquisition, the number of companies running payroll and payments charge volume. This reinforces the digital tailwinds and positioning of our platform and Big Bets Sasan touched on earlier. We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3rd, resulting in revenue of $144 million for the partial quarter. Our strategic focus with Credit Karma is to grow the core of credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals such as home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals, focused on money innovation including savings and checking accounts. I'll share more detail on each of these strategic focus areas. First, our focus is growing the core. We are seeing new credit card and personal loan partners onboarding while overall partner activity continues to recover. Adoption of the industry-first Lightbox continues to grow. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to more tightly integrate with its financial partners which helps match members to the products that are right for them. This now represents approximately 40% of credit card transactions and approximately 30% of personal loan transactions, up substantially year-over-year. Second, our focus is expanding growth verticals. Although it's early days, we're seeing strong growth in auto insurance followed by home loans and then auto loans, January revenue in the growth vertical is up over 1.5 times year-over-year, it's a high watermark. During the quarter, we introduced Karma Drive providing members an easy opportunity to qualify for an auto insurance discount based on actual driving habits. Third, our focus is developing emerging verticals, particularly money innovation, and we're just getting started with Credit Karma money. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue, double-digits and growing, operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we're starting to see the opportunity for faster margin expansion over time. And I'm proud of the progress that team is making. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate and opportunities that yield an expected return on investments greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities, with an emphasis of becoming an AI driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priorities at cash regenerate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we repurchased $175 million of stock during the second quarter. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable April 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, while macro uncertainty continues, we remain confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 53% to 55%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.85 to $5.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.75 $6.85. You can find our full Q3 and reiterated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Hey, Ken, thanks for the question here. Lightbox is a great technology that really is \u2013 enables us to have a winning experience for both the customer and for our partners, our financial institution partners, as well as us. There is nothing more frustrating than for a customer to come in and not be able to get access to a financial product that they thought they would. And so, it enables the financial institutions to be able to better target the products that they have and then customers are much more likely to actually be approved. So with the metrics that we have right now, we'll have to see how those trends over time, we're very excited about it, we want to continue to have more and more transactions go through Lightbox, because as we said, it's a better experience for the customer and it also is a better experience for our partners. Yes. Thank you, Brad. Good question. We are off to a strong start with Credit Karma, feel good about the progress that they're making. We're seeing the business bounce back more quickly from the pandemic than we had expected, not all the way back to pre-COVID levels, but definitely making progress there. When you think about seasonality in the business, they do see a little bit stronger in the January, February time period, but there isn't a huge seasonality in the business. But I would say in January, February is a little bit more of an uptick. As people are coming into the new year and some of those new resolutions and so forth, but that's what I would say you guys should expect. Thanks for the question Keith, first of all. For us as we've been thinking about margins and margin expansion, really the biggest driver of any of that is us becoming more and more of an AI driven expert platform. And so you may see some expenses here, there, and obviously you see margins move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But I would say really focus on our guidance, which is after last year expanding margins a point. This year we expect margins to expand approximately 110 basis points, once you're excluding Credit Karma. And that is really us continuing to evolve, to being more of a platform company and seeing those areas for us to drive margin expansion across the company everything from technology to customer success to go to market. And so that is the biggest driver of margin expansion for us across the company. No, that's okay. I was just going to say, Kirk actually the PPP revenue that we got that was actually in Q4 we saw that. And so we did have about a four point decline, if my memory serves me correctly, 28% Online Ecosystem revenue growth in Q4, which then dropped to 24% in Q1 and that actually had a PPP in it, but we didn't have anything material in Q1. No, Jen. That program \u2013 the new PPP program has been moving, you may have seen it in the process and moving much more slowly than anyone had anticipated, and now we don't have anything in that material on that Q2 results. I'm sorry. Can you repeat that, Brad? I didn't hear the last part of it. No. No. There shouldn't be any real big reason why you shouldn't see that. No."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Second quarter results reflect strong momentum across the company. Small Business and Self-Employed Group grew double digits. Credit Karma performed very well and we are encouraged by our early results this tax season. We are on track for Intuit to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. We are confident our game plan to win is durable, accelerated by digital tailwinds given the pandemic. Our platform is well positioned to help customers take advantage of a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omni-channel capabilities, and new ways to reduce debt and save money. The velocity of our innovation is helping our customers at a time when they need us most, and positions us to accelerate growth in light of these structural and behavioral changes. We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3rd, and welcomed 1,300 Credit Karma employees to the Intuit family. We bring together a large customer base of 110 million Credit Karma members and 57 million Intuit customers to help them unlock smart money decisions. Credit Karma's data platform creates powerful network effects through personalized financial offers \u2013 benefitting members and partners \u2013 while adding a new monetization engine to Intuit. We are off and running executing on our innovation roadmap which I will touch on shortly. Since we're in the middle of tax season, let's start there. We are very confident in our strategy and momentum extending our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. We are making great progress serving fast growing underpenetrated Latinx, self-employed and investor segments. This season, we also expanded our free eligibility to better serve customers receiving unemployment benefits. We continue to aggressively transform the assisted segment by reshaping how 86 million filers can get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. We feel great about how the season is progressing. Let me now shift to our Big Bets. We are seeing strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the business with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face, and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I will highlight our progress, covering Big Bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We are solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we are transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 86 million filers, the opportunity to access tax experts on our platform. We continue to lead the way in shaping the category, helping customers understand how they can get their taxes done in a new way with our marketing campaigns and for a limited time, offering free Live expertise to filers with very simple returns to attract them into the category. We have significantly improved the TurboTax Live platform by making it easier for customers to access an expert throughout the filing experience, and now with our innovative full service offering, our customers can hand-off their return to an expert who will prepare it and file it for them. We continue to make progress with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. Entering our second peak season with QuickBooks Live, our customer base has doubled from a year ago and retention rates are improving. Although it's early days for QuickBooks Live, we are confident in the long-term opportunity to penetrate non-consumption. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We are making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. Our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals, focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. As we make personalized financial offers to customers across our platform, Credit Karma provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. We've made great initial progress combining our capabilities to fuel success of the Credit Karma platform. First, to create a complete financial profile for existing and prospective members, with customer consent, we combined income data from 26 million TurboTax returns with Credit Karma. The combination of verified income data with credit history will enable Credit Karma to better personalize offers, driving engagement and creating a win-win-win for our members, partners and us over time. This enables us to grow in our core verticals for credit cards and personal loans and growth verticals for insurance and mortgages. Second, we integrated Credit Karma Money into the TurboTax filing experience, providing approximately 36 million TurboTax customers ability to deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into a no-fee checking account. And third, we are migrating Turbo users to Credit Karma. We are excited about the journey ahead of us. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are innovating with velocity to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We are making it even easier for customers to get paid fast with tools like payment-enabled invoices, by auto-enabling new customers to accept payments immediately, increasing our charge volume. We continue to innovate with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital by providing visibility into their full financial picture, along with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them. Now taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks, we integrated Bill Pay into the offering this quarter. We are seeing growing adoption and active use of QuickBooks Cash, including a meaningful increase in activation rates. We are making good progress with QuickBooks Commerce, launched last September. QuickBooks Commerce is designed to better serve the 1 million product-based businesses on our platform and 6.4 million product-based businesses in our core markets. The offering provides inventory and order management tools small businesses need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. We continue to add new partner integrations, enabling a streamlined experience. We're further bolstering the offering with the acquisition of OneSaas in early February. OneSaas is an infrastructure platform that integrates data streams from multiple sources of e-commerce platforms. This will help our customers see a complete view in QuickBooks. It's still early for both QuickBooks Cash and QuickBooks Commerce, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The features we are introducing individually tailor the offering to the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We continue to build out the offering and innovate to better serve these mid-market small business customers, by adding more deeply integrated partners, important to both acquisition and retention. And finally, our first big bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, enables us to put more money in our customers' pockets, eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. In TurboTax, we're leveraging advanced models to proactively offer customers the right resources at the right time to keep them engaged and give them confidence to file their taxes. And in QuickBooks Advanced, we're using AI to detect anomalies in price and quantity on customer invoices, saving our customers time and the frustration of having to resend an invoice. Our Live offerings are benefiting from a common AI platform that is creating efficiencies at scale, driving profitable growth. Across all of our big bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. I'm excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us, and I'm proud of the progress we are making as a team. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Great, thanks Michelle. I'm very proud of our team and all we've accomplished together and I'm very optimistic about the future. So with that said, let's now open it up to your questions. Thank you for your question, Scott. If I would take you back to what we declared several years ago, one element was under-penetrated segments. The investment community was one, of course Self-Employed and Latinx. And the other element of course is about transforming the assistant segment, which also helps us serve that community. Well, if they need expertise or if they want us to do their taxes for them. And what I would tell you, we all see the same stats, there is then really a significant increase in retail investors using all the different tools that are out there and not just in the United States, but particularly in Brazil, India, and the U.S. And, so I feel good that we're very well positioned. And all of those segments that I mentioned, Latinx Self-Employed and Premier, we are actually experiencing the kind of growth that we expected and probably, a kick-up on our Premier offering, which really serves our investment community. So we are experiencing an accelerated growth and it's really all sort of in context of what we had declared, and we'll have to see how the season plays out when we tally up our results, what it all looks like, but we're very, very pleased with the fact that we really positioned ourselves to serve the segment a few years ago. And I think we're positioned well for delivering for them this season, both with live platform and if you want to do it yourself. Sure. A couple of things, I would say, one, the assumptions that we made coming into this tax season is that IRS returns would be sort of flattish and we expect to be able to grow our share of the total number of returns, and particularly because of our focus on the under-penetrated segments that I mentioned and transforming the assistance segment with our live platforms, really for us, it's about growing our share of the entire category and as, we have such a massive opportunity with $86 million filers that today go to somebody else to do their taxes. And the fact that we have an opportunity to help them get their taxes on with the expert at their fingertips with any time that they needed. So really our role is about growing the category and in context of a flattish IRS returns. All of our guidance, just \u2013 we made the assumption that is April 15 finished, we contemplated the Taxes announcement that was made yesterday, we're really just looking at past situations where there is been a disaster where IRS has extended the filing date. The behaviors are very different net-net, we feel very good about our progress, we feel very good about our momentum and really good about the potential that we have this season and the context of the guidance that we provided. Thank you. Scott. Sure, Ken. Good to hear from you. It's important just to remind ourselves that we're \u2013 in the assistant segment, the biggest problem that we're solving is competence. These $86 million filers need to know that they can ask a question from an expert at any time that they need to and have the ability to turn over their return if they so choose. And we are getting very good traction with full service, but it really plays, I would say, a Halo effect. What customers want to know is that, they can come in and if they choose to ask for help that they can get it, and somewhere in the experience, if they choose to just say here, let me give you all of my documents digitally that we can do it for them, or even if they choose to make that choice upfront. So full service beyond the actual number of customers that will end up using full service really is playing a Halo effect, which is what we learned in our test results last year, it really builds confidence for filers that are coming from the assisted category that I can get my questions answered, there's always going to be an expert at my side. And as a reminder last year, we experienced 70%-plus growth in TurboTax Live, and a majority of those customers actually came from the assisted category. So it's playing the role exactly as we had assumed that it would. And so far so good this season in terms of the traction that we're getting. Yes, sure. Let me start Brad with the actual recovery, depending on the geography United States versus UK or different States within the U.S., every geography is performing differently. And just to use an example, we've got places like Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, but have actually recovered quite nicely. And then you have places like Michigan and Washington, California and New York that are lagging. And then within that, you have industries that have come back all the way and industries that haven't. It's the natural ones that you would assume, it's fitness, restaurants, travel. I'd bring that up in context of yet another data point, which is when we look across the data points that we see about a 25% of our customers, their net dollars in their bank account is down nearly 50%. So I give you those data points just to say that small businesses are still working hard to come back to where they were, and they're not all the way back. That's really important context relative to how our trends are doing. And what you heard from Michelle, which is, we watch acquisition, we watch retention, of course we watch our payments charge volume, the number of companies running payroll, the number of employees per company using payroll time tracking et cetera. And all of those indicators are at or above pre-COVID levels except the number of employees at small businesses. And that really tells you a lot about just the innovation that's happening on our platform, the power of our platform, and the fact that in times where small businesses are actually doing worse than they were prior to COVID are actually platform metrics are at or better than pre-COVID. And so that actually really bodes well for us to not only deliver for our customers, but the growth rates that we would expect as we look ahead. So good momentum and actually bullish about where we are in the opportunities for the future. Yes, thanks for your question, Keith. And in context of being a subscription business, a lot of the growth rate we're experiencing now is the things that were happening almost a year ago this time. And in context of slower acquisition, retention, dropping a couple of points starting in March of last year. And also, there are a number of things that have huge benefit for customers that we paused, things like payroll full-service, migration, we have a line for where you have to upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced we sort of dropped that line for a while. So it was the combination of acquisition or retention along with very intentional decisions we made around pricing and migration that has had an impact on the growth rates that we're seeing now. And in addition to all of that, we're lapping price increases that we had done the same time last year. So the long answer to your short question is, what we are starting to see now, we should expect the growth rates to be impacted in the year ahead, because a lot of the metrics and the trends that we're experiencing now, we'll see the follow-on benefits in the quarters ahead. But I would say almost think about a year out or so is the way \u2013 is the best way to think about it. Thank you. Yes, sure, Sterling. Let me just if I could take it up one notch and I'll come back specifically to answer your question. There are a number of things that we have launched. We've launched Credit Karma Money at the end of the TurboTax experience where migrating, Turbo customers that with Turbo being deprecated to Credit Karma. And of course then, to your question launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. So there are a number of big things that we're doing and all of them Sterling, I would think about them as long-term opportunities with our focus being testing and experimenting right now to really nail the experience. So I wouldn't expect a really big impacts from those in the near term, but we do expect these to deliver significant customer benefit and growth in the future, because we're really just testing and experimental and really nailed experience before we launch things at scale. So hopefully that answers your question. Thank you. Sure. Kash. Let me hear from you. Let me start with live and the 86 million customers that today go to an assisted method. Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million customers are actually willing to use a digital platform as long as they can get a health and expertise to be able to file their taxes with confidence. And in fact, they would like to get help beyond taxes, which is where Credit Karma comes in. And so to your question of what we have learned with our beginning our fourth year with the live platform, we're more bullish about the opportunity ahead of us than we were even four years ago when we launched TurboTax live. Because in essence, what we've learned and that's informing what we're executing this season is one, we have 86 million folks that we need to get to consider the fact that there's a digital platform with an expert at their fingertips. And the fact that they can actually hand everything off digitally for an expert, which is where you see what we're doing in our marketing campaigns. And you may only see what we're doing off air on TV, but we've got an incredible campaign in educating our customers in multiple different digital channels to help them understand how this works, because we're really shaping and reshaping the category. So one is about education which is where a lot of our investment is going. The second is when they come in, really nailing the first-time use. Immediately when they come in, to help them understand how to get access to an expert, engaging with an expert, exchanging a document visually and seeing how easy it is. And then with now the launch of full service, if you choose to upgrade the full service or you come in and choose full service, how do we deliver instant benefits. Instant benefit by the way is confidence that there's an expert there. Now, which gets me to the other side of the equation, which I haven't mentioned, and that is our expert platform. That's really where we have advantage. A lot of our AI investments are actually improving our expert platform around scheduling, document exchange, making sure that we connect the right expert to the right customer. Ensuring that we deliver insights to the expert because of our machine learning capabilities, so that when the expert is talking to the customer it actually, they deliver confidence with their know-how and their knowledge, and then being able to, by the way the culture we're creating with the experts that we have on our platform that love the input culture or the income that they make and love the fact that they get to deliver for our customers in the comfort of their home. So those are the areas that we are focused on. And frankly, every day in the season we learned and we adjust and we love our momentum and the opportunities ahead. And what we'll learn over time is we're launching TurboTax Live as part of the Credit Karma platform. And what's unique in launching that as part of the Credit Karma platform is we'll actually be able to deliver a personalized experience because we'll know that you were a prior-year assisted customer. And that again will pay off in the long-term, but those are the things that we're testing now. In terms of your question around disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced is a couple of things that we've learned. Frankly, we believe that we can even go higher in the market beyond 10 to a 100 employees. Now, our focus right now is 10 to 100 employees, but as we see the power of our platform and the ability for it to scale, we believe that we can actually serve even bigger mid-market customers at a disruptive price. And to your question, the things that we're continuing to add are things around like workflow management, automated invoice approvals batch in the saying, getting very deep integrations of critical apps that these customers need to be able to grow their business and run their business, some of which Michelle actually mentioned in the script around like DocuSign, HubSpot, Salesforce just a few example. And every day we're learning what we need to add to the platform, but it's a lot of what we do today, just a much, much higher scale. And the confidence has given us is not only being able to go up market, but we're actually \u2013 we have now 70% of the customers that we're getting are upgraders and 30% that are new to the franchise. And we're actually seeing our new to the franchise growing even at a faster rate than what we thought without the focus yet in place to be able to go after new to the franchise. So those are the few elements that I think are worth sharing Kash. Yes. Thank you. Yes, sure, Brent. One of the things that we've been pretty consistent in communicating is that our growth rates would decline sequentially before they start bouncing and going back up. And that's really what we saw in Q2. It is very consistent with what we expected. And it's consistent with what we expected on a couple of fronts. One, because this time last year or starting in March for several months both acquisition slowed, but also our attrition popped, but in addition to that, there are things that as I mentioned a few moments ago that we paused, like full service migration, we paused our QuickBooks Advanced lineup for those upgraders. We didn't ask them to move up because we didn't want to have them experience that in the early COVID times. And so what we're experiencing now is just a reflection of some of those key indicators that we experienced earlier in the year. And we are on top of that lapping a price increase that we did last year that we didn't do this year. So you've put all of that together. We're actually quite pleased with the growth rates that we experienced in the quarter. Although we expected it to be lower than the last quarter. And then as we look ahead, as I mentioned in the coming quarters and year ahead, a lot of the indicators that Michelle and I shared will start turning into revenue growth, but everything is per our expectation. I think the only thing that's not per our expectation is the business is actually performing better than what we thought in the pandemic and therefore we're bullish about the future. You're very welcome, Brent. Yes, I would headline, but I would say \u2013 Michelle, please go ahead. Yes, Kirk it actually has. I mean, I would say if I look at it across the globe, the United States has really not just bounced back nicely, but just the resiliency of our platform. The innovation on the platform is really allowing us to see all the indicators get back to or better than pre-COVID levels. When we look at outside of the United States, countries like UK, Australia, France actually were hit much harder and to your point, they are still, specifically in UK and France in a lockdown so that has impacted the growth rate relative to what we see in the United States. But all of that is within the context of the guidance that we have provided, it has seen a hit. Yes. Thank you. Yes, sure. Good to hear from you, Michael. Just as a quick refresher, there are three elements around growth in Credit Karma. It's going to core, which is credit cards and personal loans. It's expanding our growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance. And then emerging verticals, which is really all around assets, which is money innovation. And none of this is really coming from the third bucket. And the second point I would make is, we sort of have a 75-25, about 75% of the revenue is coming from in the credit cards and personal loans and 25% coming from the growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance, which is actually really improved versus about a year ago, where it was 95% at credit cards and personal loans. And specifically, would that context to answer your question. We're seeing more partners come back on the platform, we're seeing new partners come on, we're starting to see higher spend and because of just the innovation with LightBox and does better matching, we're getting more customers to actually get connected to the financial products that are right for them and partners are benefiting from it. So the performance we experienced this quarter is just we're seeing stronger momentum, when it comes to credit cards, personal loans and then the growth vertical specifically around auto insurance. And when we \u2013 look ahead, our overall guidance was just based on the trajectory that we assume for the year, and we'll just have to continue to see how these verticals play out, but we liked the momentum that we see, but that could be the reason in the long-term for over performance to your question. Specifically around margin, it really important to note that one, we manage margins at the company level. And so really pay attention to the guidance that we provided the company level. Two, we are investing in Credit Karma. It is a \u2013 we see it in the long-term as a big growth engine for the company. The penetration, when you think about the 110 million members that Credit Karma has the penetration with all these different financial products that I mentioned, it's actually still quite low. So it's actually quite exciting, as we look ahead the possibilities of increasing penetration. So we are investing dollars in Credit Karma, all within the context of the guidance and margin expansion guidelines that we have provided. So I wouldn't get too anchored on the current quarter margin rates. It was more because it performed better than what we thought and some of the investments and hiring shifted between quarters. I would more focus on company level operating income that we provided and margin rates that we provided. Yes. Thank you. Yes, Jen. Thanks for your question. What I would say is, the economic indicators are still below pre-COVID levels. It's more our own indicators and the performance of our platform that has bounced back and in many cases better than the pre-COVID levels, which gets I think the essence of your question, and that is, our goal in the long-term has not changed. We believe that we will get this business specifically, the online revenue growth back above 30% and we just need to keep executing our game plan. And I would tell you that we don't think it's heavily relied upon how the economy bounces back, because if you look at where we are today versus six months ago, a lot of the performance that we are talking about is based on the performance of the platform at our execution and the innovation on our platform. Now, at the end of the day, this economy does need a stimulus \u2013 fiscal stimulus to get people back into jobs, but that is not the anchor for us to get back to the growth rates that we believe we could get back to it. It'll just take some time. Yes. Thank you. Kartik, thank you for your question. Our main focus around pricing will be, when we believe it's the right time given how small businesses are performing and given the pandemic. It is actually not related to our innovation, but as you know, we now have innovation that allows us to go up market with both QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live, which is a much higher ARPU offering. We have the ability at the garner higher price from customers, but from a price increase perspective, it's less about the metrics and indicators that we see with our own platform, but more when we believe is the right time to raise prices with customers given, what they're experiencing and the challenges that they're experiencing for their business. So the two are in many ways unrelated in terms of the way we think about it. What I would share with you that we've learned about the Credit Karma base as a big portion of their customers actually use an assisted method. And that is actually what is exciting to us now. Because they have 110 million members, you can imagine that a strong cross section of folks in the U.S., whether Latin ex, self-employed those that are retail investors. So that cross section is generally consistent with the customers we serve in TurboTax today. What different is, we've got a good majority of those customers that in the prior year used an assisted method. Yes. You're very welcome. Yes, sure. Thank you, Siti. First of all, we're very excited about QuickBooks Commerce and it's also very, very early innings with QuickBooks Commerce. And the acquisition we just made with OneSaas actually allows us to bring data into the platform from marketplaces, from POS providers, from fulfillment apps. And so it really actually helps us \u2013 help the customer understand how they're doing and their profitability, which is what's most important to the customers. We actually had to restrict the top of the funnel to ensure that we can nail the customer experience. And so our focus first was ensuring that we can serve new customers that don't use our inventory today. Our next focus will be existing QBO customers that don't use any of our inventory capabilities. And then third will be existing QBO customers that actually do use our inventory capabilities. And the reason that's important is we want to ensure that if a customer already has inventory, that we can easily sync all the product catalogs and their product numbers, and to keep their books clean. So net-net, we're just getting started. We had to restrict the top of the funnel because of the demand and the excitement that was out there because we want to be very intentional in terms of building out the capability. Very early indicators are positive with the number of customers that we have on our platform. But again, think about QuickBooks Commerce, think about QuickBooks Cash as these are long-term plays in terms of when and how they will deliver growth, but so far we're bullish about the early indicators. All right. Thank you, Siti. Yes. The biggest thing, well, first of all, it's very early days. So we look at more cohort of customers versus the aggregate numbers. The biggest reason we're so focused on retention right now with QuickBooks Live is we're focused on understanding customer needs and really nailing the experience, because QuickBooks Live there are customers that come in to get set up. There are customers that come in that want us to provide them advice. And they're just \u2013 they're looking for bookkeeping advice and there are our customers actually want us to do their taxes for them and run their books for them. And what we're really being intentional about is understanding what are the needs, what are the experience that we need to deliver? And what does that look like on the platform, which is why you heard me mention retention. Retention right now is more focused on cohorts. And it is a lower than QBO only because we're looking at different cohorts of customers and their needs are very different. And before we really open up the top of the funnel, we want to make sure that every customer loves the experience that they're getting from us on QuickBooks Live and the team is just innovating like crazy to close some of the gaps in. So we're excited about the possibilities. Yes. Thank you. Yes, Arvind, it's not particularly just from the crypto users, we're just \u2013 there are just millions more of customers that are doing their own trading in the U.S. and outside of the United States. And come tax time, they need to be able to do their taxes. And so we're just seeing increase in our Premier product, both with live, because if you need assistance, you can use live. And if you want to Do-It-Yourself, you'd just use force our [ph] Premier Do-It-Yourself product. So we're seeing an overall increase based on an increase in retail investing. I think call out something that's material on the crypto side. Yes. The way we designed our long-term growth rates is under-penetrated segments, which is investment community, self-employed and Latinx and its TurboTax Live. And with TurboTax Live, just by design, it has a higher ARPU. Now \u2013 right now we are so early in the shaping of the category and being able to acquire our customers that the best thing for you all to anchor on is what we shared at Investor Day, which is our long-term expectations just on the tax side is 8% to 12%. And probably the largest driver of the higher end is ARPU. And just know that we're being very intentional about right now, raising awareness close with our campaigns, but the free expertise that we're providing for those that have very simple returns, just to create awareness in the category, but in the long-term, it's ARPU because of the assistant segment. You are welcome. Yes. Sure Michael, thank you for your question. The point I made earlier was twofold. One that this is a learning year for us in launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we're just running a lot of experiments to make sure that we can deliver a fantastic experience before we go big in the out years. But the second comment that I made is that that a good portion, we've not divulged the number of Credit Karma members use the assisted segment. And it's very much connected to when you look at there's $155 million or $160 million IRS returns, $86 million are in the assistant segment, proportionality is the same thing within the Credit Karma base. So that's the point that I was making earlier. To your second question about RALs, really the biggest driver of getting a customer to use a digital platform is actually confidence, not early access to their money. They have to first have confidence that they can get their taxes done right with you, which is where our experts and expertise comes in. And that's really where a lot of our investments are going. We also provide early access to your refund, but really the big driver is about ensuring that we deliver confidence to our experts. Yes, first of all, we're really focused on getting these customers to come to our platform by ensuring that they know that they can get access to an expert. So confidence is first and foremost, and of course our different methods that we can help these customers get early access to the refund. That's very, very consumer friendly. So the answer is yes, but it's secondary to providing expertise to these customers to use the platform. All right, Michael. Thank you so much. Thank you. You do the same. And thank you everybody. I know we ran a little bit over. I appreciate everyone's questions. I wish everyone well stay safe until next time. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuit\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks, Kim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. I hope you are all doing well. We had a very strong start to fiscal year 2021. First quarter revenue grew 14%. Total revenue growth was driven by 13% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, while Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter. This is a great start to the year in a challenging environment, which reinforces the resiliency of our platform. We\u2019re growing more confident in how our business is performing in the current environment, although macro uncertainty remains. We continue to see recovering trends across our platform with many QuickBooks indicators back to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, I\u2019m happy to announce that we will provide guidance for fiscal year 2021, which Michelle will cover in more detail later. At our September Investor Day, we shared the acceleration of innovation, driven by our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our 5 Big Bets, highlighting our growth potential. During the Platform Immersion Experience, we demonstrated progress against each Big Bet. What I\u2019d like to do is highlight a few of the innovations and cover Big Bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and it\u2019s foundational to the other bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We\u2019re solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. We grew the number of TurboTax Live customers on our platform at nearly 70% last season while increasing our expert product recommendation scores by 4 points. The team is hard at work as we prepare for the season ahead. We\u2019re also proud of the progress we\u2019ve made with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. We already have more than 600 experts serving customers today, with some of these experts serving both Taps and small business customers. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We expect our pending acquisition of Credit Karma to be more important than ever as we work to help consumers save money, get out of debt and have faster access to money. We expect to complete the acquisition before the end of this calendar year. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow. QuickBooks Cash helps small businesses manage working capital by providing visibility into their financial picture while providing them with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them, all while leveraging the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We launched QuickBooks Commerce in September to better serve the 1 million product-based businesses on our platform by providing inventory and order management tools they need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. We\u2019ve also identified 6.4 million product-based businesses in the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia that could benefit from this solution. And we\u2019ll innovate with high velocity to take advantage of this market opportunity. It\u2019s still early with both QuickBooks Cash and Commerce, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced and the features that we\u2019re introducing to individually tailor the offering to the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We doubled our QuickBooks Online Advanced customers to 75,000 in fiscal year 2020, and we\u2019re continuing to build on this momentum. We continue to pursue our premium app strategy and introduced integrations with Salesforce and HubSpot. We now have two of the largest CRM solutions available for our customers. And finally, our first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, enables us to put more money in our customers\u2019 pocket, to eliminate friction and deliver confidence in every touch point by using AI and customer insights. Last year, we increased use of AI and increased the number of model deployed across our platform by over 50%, tripled the speed of delivery on our modern development platform and increased mobile application deployments by 60%. We\u2019re building on this momentum this year as we innovate rapidly to solve our customers\u2019 biggest problems. Across all of our Big Bets, we\u2019re building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. We also believe the current environment continues to act as an accelerant to these bets. Most everyone is looking for virtual solutions. Small businesses are accelerating their shift to online and omnichannel commerce. And both, consumers and small businesses are looking for ways to put more money in their pockets. So, to wrap up, I\u2019m excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. And now, let me turn it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021: we delivered revenue of $1.3 billion; GAAP operating income of $209 million versus $10 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $334 million versus $129 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75 versus $0.22 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 versus $0.41 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 13% during the quarter. Online Ecosystem revenue was up 24% during the quarter. Growth slowed from Q4, reflecting the lagging impact of lower retention during fiscal 2020 and the lapping of price increases, which began during the middle of Q1 last year. Additionally, Q4 included 4 points of growth from nonrecurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both, customers and ARPC. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. We began lapping a partial quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 17% in fiscal Q1. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payrolls, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 51%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the first quarter, while QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth also reflects the benefit of additional revenues from license updates and tailwinds from previously announced price increases in various products, not fully reflected in the year ago quarter. We do not expect these tailwinds to recur in future quarters. Consumer Group revenue grew 19% in Q1. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY, transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live and disrupt consumer finance. Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 21% in Q1, in line with our expectations. Let me turn to our acquisition of Credit Karma. I\u2019m looking forward to welcoming the Credit Karma team to Intuit, and we\u2019re excited about the unprecedented benefits we can deliver for customers. I want to remind you that we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive over time. However, Credit Karma\u2019s business was negatively impacted over the last seven months as lenders tightened access to credit due to economic uncertainty related to the pandemic. The business continues to recover after reaching a low point in June, with monthly revenue in October close to pre-COVID levels. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to be modestly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2021 and neutral to modestly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after close in fiscal 2022. We\u2019re looking forward to all the innovation that we can deliver together for customers. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, though we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment or directly following the close of the Credit Karma transaction. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $5.8 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We expect to use approximately $3.6 billion of cash to fund part of the consideration for the Credit Karma acquisition. We did not repurchase any stock during the first quarter as we temporarily suspended share purchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition. Approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market in the future. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable January 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. As you may have seen, we reached an agreement to settle the class action litigation regarding the IRS Free File program. We have agreed to pay $40 million to put this matter behind us. By entering into this settlement, which is subject to court approval, we\u2019re not admitting any wrongdoing. Also, as I shared at Investor Day, Intuit is the target of a law firm whose standard approach seems to involve making a demand that companies pay a settlement amount to the law firm instead of paying fees associated with arbitration. An increasing number of companies are facing similar attacks by the same law firm. We recorded approximately $10 million in arbitration fees for Q1 of fiscal 2021 and $14 million in fiscal 2020. We\u2019ll be disclosing in our 10-Q that Intuit could incur arbitration fees of approximately $400 million related to those claims in future periods. We\u2019re in the process of disputing these fees, and we believe this is an abuse of the arbitration system. If the court approves the settlement that I mentioned earlier, we believe it may significantly reduce exposure to mass arbitration claims being brought against us. Moving on to guidance. While macro uncertainty remains, we\u2019re growing more confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 8% to 10%, GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.15 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.55. Our fiscal 2021 guidance includes 110 basis points of operating margin expansion, as we\u2019re starting to see the leverage of our platform, which I shared at Investor Day. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2021. This compares to a GAAP tax rate of 17% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2020. These increases are driven primarily by state and IRS changes to the R&D tax credit and expected decrease to our excess tax benefits for share-based compensation. This equates to an impact of $0.53 to our GAAP earnings per share and $0.11 to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the higher tax rate. Our Q2 fiscal 2021 guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.89 to $0.92 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.34. You can find our full Q2 and fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. One final note on Q2. We\u2019re lapping a full quarter of a price increase in Q2, which we expect to negatively impact Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth by a couple of points. Also, shortly after we close the Credit Karma acquisition, we will hold a call to discuss our revised guidance. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. Team, I\u2019m very proud of our organization and all that we\u2019ve accomplished together, and I\u2019m very optimistic about the future. So with that, let\u2019s now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question, and a really solid start to the year, guys. When looking at the guidance, specifically the SMB guidance, one might infer that you guys have removed the W and double W macro scenarios off the table. Is that the right way to think about it, or is it just purely that your business has held up much better, and the realities are we still may run into those. But if we do, it will tilt towards this new 8% to 10% lower end?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hey, Ken. Good to hear from you. I think, the best way I would describe it is, one, we\u2019re actually seeing how resilient our platform is and how small businesses are using our platform in this pandemic. I think to -- because of that, it just gives us confidence, as we look ahead in terms of how small businesses are going to be able to maneuver through this current environment. So, we\u2019re primarily going off of the key indicators that we see that are both,, leading and lagging, and that is really what has given us confidence to provide the guidance that we\u2019ve given. Of course, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how things play out with the health crisis and the impact of the economic crisis. But given just what we\u2019re seeing in our business, that\u2019s really what\u2019s informed our guidance that we shared today.\nKen Wong: Got it. And if I could squeeze one in for Michelle. You mentioned the EBIT guidance is -- it looks like the margin expansion will be, give or take, 100, 110 basis points. And you did previously mention seeing more leverage going forward. Is this the right level of margin expansion that we should be expecting as we look ahead?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hi, Ken. Thanks. Going to our financial principles, that really is the long-term commitment that we have and that includes growing revenue double digits and growing operating income faster than revenue. And so, we -- as I mentioned, yes, we do expect to see 110 basis points of expansion, excluding Credit Karma. As I shared at Investor Day, though, as we continue to evolve to more of an AI-driven expert platform, we do see opportunities for margin expansion across the P&L. And those opportunities can be in the areas of technology, where we\u2019re increasing the velocity of development on our actual technology platform so we can deliver faster and also using products and services across the company. We also see that in customer success, where we\u2019re scaling a common customer success platform, that drives efficiency and effectiveness serving across all products. And then, also in go-to-market, we\u2019re able to leverage a common infrastructure so that we can more effectively target customers and manage our sales and marketing processes. So, we do continue to see opportunities for us to expand margin going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. First question I was hoping to ask, I\u2019m not sure if you guys are going to comment on this, was just a current status update on your expectations on timing for Credit Karma, number one. And number two, whether all the sort of constituent pieces of Credit Karma are expected to come along because there was some speculation in the press that they might be selling off their tax business. Any chance you could comment on either of those?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Keith. Good to hear from you. First of all, we do have pretty high confidence that we will close Credit Karma by the end of calendar year. So, that\u2019s the first point. I think, the second point is, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on rumors. But, it\u2019s important to reinforce that the whole premise behind the Credit Karma acquisition was what we could do together to create a consumer finance platform, and it wasn\u2019t for the tax business. And so, I think, I will just leave it at that. But nevertheless, we\u2019re really excited and can\u2019t wait to close this, so we can start doing amazing things together for consumers.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. If I could maybe sneak one last one since that last one is like half of the answer. In the broader platform within SMB, when you\u2019re going into stuff like cash, when you\u2019re trying to do more of the commerce back-end, how is this changing your competitive environment? Have you seen a significant sort of change in kind of who you\u2019re going up against or sort of how you have to position the solutions for these newer solutions?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hey Keith, thanks for calling me out, buddy. In terms of your question, it\u2019s interesting timing. We had QuickBooks Connect yesterday, which is where we have thousands of small businesses and accountants and partners together. And of course, this one was far, far bigger than it ever has been because it was all virtual. And we rolled out a lot of our innovation. But particularly, to answer your question, we also rolled out QuickBooks Commerce and QuickBooks Cash to our customer base or at least gave visibility and awareness. And the feedback was just through the roof. Because if I start with accountants, accountants were very excited because now they can recommend QuickBooks to product-based businesses, and they love how QuickBooks Commerce works for product-based businesses, and they love the fact that they can, in essence, help a small business run their business through the platform. And two small businesses that were product-based businesses, they love Commerce, and by the way, we got raving reviews on QuickBooks Cash, and it\u2019s just a simple app where you can send and receive money to be able to run your business. And so, I would say from a positioning standpoint, we\u2019re not doing anything differently in terms of going up against others. What we\u2019re really focused on is the customer problem and how we\u2019re raising awareness. And in fact, our team has done some great work in the months and the year ahead, what you\u2019ll see is we\u2019ll be, in essence, going to market with digital assets that helps small businesses understand that we can truly be the source of truth for their entire business versus the source of truth for their books and from an accounting lens. And so, it\u2019s more about what we\u2019re doing to raise awareness and shape the market versus doing anything differently, given who we\u2019re going up against because it\u2019s, frankly no different than what it\u2019s been in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of WF Securities.\nMichael Turrin: On guidance and the decision to bring that back, obviously, the bigger focus now is on Small Business. But looking ahead to tax, I mean, you\u2019ve previously mentioned tough comps from the strong top-of-funnel activity you saw last year, still guiding for 9% to 10% growth as a starting point there this year. Can you just help maybe frame out the base case there and maybe your confidence around ability to further monetize that uptick you saw this past year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Michael. Very good to hear from you. First of all, as we talked about last quarter, our biggest uncertainty was around the macro environment and the impact to small businesses and how our platform would perform in the times of uncertainty. So, we\u2019ve just learned a ton. One, all the credit to small businesses in terms of just their passion to do whatever it takes to survive; but then two, us better understanding how they use the platform to be able to deliver for customers. And so, given that and given that we started experiencing businesses opening across the Company and our confidence is at an improved level than it was a quarter ago. With that said, to your question around tax, we\u2019re bullish about our strategy, and we\u2019ve continued to be bullish based on the results that we\u2019re seeing. And particularly, it\u2019s driven by two primary areas. One, it\u2019s who we focus on; and then, the second is the how. So, who we focus on is, we\u2019ve doubled down several years ago on serving investors, serving self-employed and serving the Latinx market, all of which we are underpenetrated. And then, two, really going after the market, the assisted market, and those that are looking for more confidence with TurboTax Live. And so, although our comps compared to last year are tough comps, we do have confidence in our execution, our trajectory. And that\u2019s really what informed the guidance that we provided.\nMichael Turrin: Got it. That\u2019s all clear. Certainly a nice start to the year. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS.\nJennifer Lowe: I wanted to drill down on the international growth because of the 51% was a pretty impressive number. And I think at Analyst Day, you exited fiscal \u201820 with around 14% growth in subs. Obviously pricing has been a pretty strong lever. So, can you just maybe break down or sort of decompose the components of that 51% growth? How much of that is potentially an improvement in the subscriber count that you\u2019re seeing there versus just continued success on pricing initiatives?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hi, Jennifer. Good to hear from you. It\u2019s both. Very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day. We continue to see strength in the UK and Canada. And we\u2019re seeing some of the emerging markets that we\u2019re focused on, like Brazil and France, really start their acceleration even in this current environment. And so, really, it\u2019s a combination of being very-focused on who we pursue with what products we pursue and then also really intentional about pricing, and frankly, a lot less discounting, especially in places like Canada and UK, where we created a network effect with small businesses using us, recommending us, with accountants using us and recommending us. And so, we don\u2019t have to discount as much to get our name known. So, it\u2019s very similar to what we talked about, which is it\u2019s a combination of customer growth and ARPC growth. And the ARPC growth is a lot to do with what we\u2019re selling and a lot less discounting.\nJennifer Lowe: Great. And maybe just one more for me. So, a little while ago over the summer as the world was changing with COVID-19, you, like many other companies, took some actions to sort of deemphasize some of the less growthy businesses and then plan to bring back the head count over time in some of the growthier parts of the business. I\u2019m just curious where you are in that process at this point. And maybe specific to the margin guidance, what\u2019s the assumption on the pace of getting back into the hiring groove on your business and cost structure?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Just for a quick context, there are a couple of areas where we felt like we needed to double down in context of the bets that we\u2019ve declared. It\u2019s the type of talent that we\u2019re pursuing, both in creating a modern operations and our customer success, but also the type of experts that we want to bring into customer success. And then, in technology, it was more systems engineers, infrastructure engineers, cloud engineers that have lots of experience in building complex systems in the cloud. And we are aggressively hiring in those areas because they ultimately are very important in serving the bets that I talked about earlier and a lot of our innovation, we\u2019ve been talking about like commerce, cash advance, et cetera. So, we feel good about our hiring ramp. And I think, I would just really focus on the guidance that Michelle talked about, which includes about 110 basis points of margin expansion. And all of our approach to hiring is all embedded in the guidance that we provided.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JP Morgan.\nSterling Auty: Just one question from my side. You talked about the headwind from renewal rates from previous quarter impacted this quarter\u2019s revenue. Can you just give us an update, what did you see in terms of renewal rates through this quarter in the Small Business franchise?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. They\u2019re actually the tailwinds -- or the headwinds are in three buckets. One is, overall, as we shared at Investor Day, our retention dropped by a couple of points based on what we saw in the March, April, May timeframe. That, along with lapping a price increase and actually not taking price action deliberately, plus the impact from acquisitions in those same months, is really what impacted our growth rate for the quarter that you see here. And our view is, effective the second quarter will be probably the lowest point of the year for the Small Business Group for the same exact reasons that I just mentioned. As you know, we don\u2019t break out quarterly attrition and retention rates. We share once a year at Investor Day. So, those are the main drivers of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Sasan, if you could just talk about the shape of the recovery in SMB that you\u2019re seeing and the conviction level you have that that continues. Can you just give us a sense of how you\u2019re seeing that progress? And then, I just had a quick follow-up. You were showing the TurboTax full opportunity set on your website. You removed it. It seems really interesting in terms of the opportunity to outsource everything to you. Can you just walk through your intentions for that solution this year? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Brent. Good to hear from you. In terms of the shape of the recovery, it\u2019s actually quite consistent with what we shared at Investor Day. May -- most of our indicators are back to pre-pandemic levels, but charge volume is still several points lower. The number of companies running payroll is still several points lower. So although things have recovered, the reality is things are still below pre-pandemic levels. I think, where we have more confidence, Brent, is now we are actually seeing how our platform is -- really how resilient it is and how it\u2019s delivering benefits for customers in these very tough times, plus the innovation that we have across the platform. So, just seeing how our platform is playing out and seeing the impact of our innovation is actually what gives us even more confidence. And from a recovery standpoint, not much has changed in the last six weeks and what we shared at Investor Day. To turn to your second question, we\u2019re actually -- when you think about transforming the assisted segment and really helping customers do their taxes with confidence, there are those that choose to do it themselves. But, at one point in time, they may want to hit a button and get an expert to come, talk to them, review their return to gain confidence. So, those that from the beginning may choose to have help along the way and pick TurboTax Live as an actual offering right off the bat. And then, there are those that may start and decide, you know what, I just want you to do my taxes for me, which is a lot of what we were testing in the last several months. And our plan is to actually launch the platform with all of those capabilities come -- this coming tax season, which by the way is right around the corner.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: I just want to ask about trends you are seeing in terms of new customer acquisition. Because we saw this recent Q3 data, census data, there\u2019s a record number of small business creation, in Q3, I think, 1.6 million versus average of 800,000. So, I guess most of these could be potentially QuickBooks customer. So, how should we think about this opportunity and the current trend of this new customer acquisition?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Siti, good to hear from you, and a really good question. As I mentioned, there are a few of our key metrics that have recovered quite nicely, but they\u2019re still below the pre-COVID levels like charge volume and payroll. Acquisition is one that\u2019s actually rebounded quite nicely, and we\u2019re actually benefiting from some of what you shared, which is more new business formation. So, that\u2019s probably a metric above and beyond all of them that is probably more in the green, and we\u2019re benefiting from some of that recovery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse.\nYaoxian Chew: Hi, everyone. This is Yao on for Brad. Thanks for my taking my question. It\u2019s a little bit specific but also philosophical here, and it\u2019s around QuickBooks Commerce and the specific topic of discounting. I understand it\u2019s a new solution, and you want mass market adoption, but when I go to the website, it shows 92% of monthly list price for the first 12 months of service. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that in software before. I guess, what\u2019s the thought process here, especially as it sounds like you\u2019re being more thoughtful around optimizing for discounts in other areas of your business?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Yao, good to hear from me and very good question. Two things I would say. One is, we are actually very intentionally qualifying customers on top of the funnel to ensure that we only bring in customers that we can deliver against their expectations, given just we literally just launched the platform. Interesting enough, one thing that we\u2019re seeing is customers want to use it so bad, they go back to the top of the funnel and change their answers, so they can qualify for it. So, the demand is quite high. I think, you may have fallen into one of our test cells. There\u2019s a lot of different things that we\u2019re testing, different business models, different pricing. So, I don\u2019t know exactly what you fell into, but it sounds like you fell into a test cell.\nYaoxian Chew: Got it. The other bit I guess around the 9% to 10% -- I\u2019m sorry, the QuickBooks and Small Business growth scenario there. Just thinking about exogenous factors that may result in upside or downside, does -- a hypothetical government stimulus package, how does that help churn or business creation and how to think about that flowing through to your model?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. The stimulus, I would say, no pun intended, is not really going to be a big stimulus for small businesses. It\u2019s not going to make a difference between them going out of business or not. I\u2019ll hit on one element of your question, which is the range of the guidance. The low end of the guidance is really driven from how restrictive the states becomes, how restrictive the country becomes beyond what we\u2019re all seeing, which is you now no longer -- although every x state is a little different, you no longer can go into a fitness center, it\u2019s only if it\u2019s outside. You can\u2019t go eat inside at all. Now schools like the New York public schools just closed again. So, everybody has to go from home. That has implications to the local economy. So, the low end of the guidance is more how restrictive things get and then the impact on small businesses, because we feel quite confident in our execution. And of course, the high end is the -- I would say the trends that we\u2019re experiencing and seeing right now. That\u2019s how we thought about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler.\nArvind Ramnani: I just wanted to -- one of the tone changes I picked up at your recent Analyst Day was kind of really focusing on increasing revenue per customer. I just want to see if that was kind of something that you are looking to do to really increase revenue per customer, and how you\u2019re planning to approach it over the next couple of years.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Arvind, good to hear from you. Let me just play back to your question because you were cutting in and out. I want to make sure I\u2019m answering the question that you\u2019re asking. I think, your question was, we talked about revenue per customer increasing at Investor Day, and you were just wondering how we plan to achieve that. Did I play that back correctly?\nArvind Ramnani: Yes.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. I would say a couple of uber messages. The first one is, it\u2019s because of the incredible innovation and the acceleration of the innovation from the team that\u2019s really going after delivering benefits that that customers care about most. So, if I decompose that with a couple of examples, what I would share is, QuickBooks Live is -- has the potential to increase revenue per customer. The volume is not, of course, at the same rate, but the revenue per customer is. When you look at QuickBooks Advanced, which comes with it serving much larger customers, that has an opportunity and does move the needle when it comes to revenue per customer. And then, there\u2019s the services, the services that go with QuickBooks Live, the services that go with QuickBooks Advanced.  And then, within all the services that we provide, payments, payroll, TSheets and now with the integration of TSheets and Payroll Full Service, these services and the innovation and the impact themselves also deliver more revenue per customer. So, when you put all of those together, those are the biggest drivers of increased revenue per customer, which is just driven by the innovation that the team is delivering for customers.\nArvind Ramnani: Great, terrific. And just a quick second question for me. How transformative is your relatively new integrated CRM solution? Should we expect this to be a big revenue growth driver, or is it just another proof point of differentiated offering?\nSasan Goodarzi: I think, it\u2019s just another important innovation and benefit for customers on our QuickBooks Advanced platform. Again, when you think about these customers -- because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about like HubSpot and Salesforce. And these customers that are between 10 to 100 employees, and even larger than that. They are looking for CRM solutions. So, we invested quite a bit of time with, I\u2019ll use HubSpot as an example, to really deeply integrate. In fact, I was reviewing the demo several days ago, and it\u2019s a really cool experience for our customers. So, this is -- it just positions us and allows us to not only serve our existing customers with QuickBooks Advanced, but also penetrate and get new customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: I was hoping, Sasan or Michelle, if you could elaborate please on the mix shift driving in QuickBooks Online accounting. If you could delve in a little deeper, primary drivers and sustainability you foresee there. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Scott. I\u2019ll jump in, and if there\u2019s anything Michelle wants that she can jump in. It\u2019s very similar to what I just shared with Arvind. First of all, I\u2019ll start with the headline that it\u2019s very sustainable. We\u2019re just getting started. And when you look at the mix that gets driven by the platform with QuickBooks Live, it gets -- another one is QuickBooks Advanced. And both of these come with them services, like payments and payroll and TSheets, and then apps like HubSpot, as an example, that allows us to drive a mix shift. And so, those are just examples. And then, QuickBooks Commerce, which really gives us the opportunity to serve product-based businesses that we served for years in desktop, the million product-based services that we have on desktop. Now we have an opportunity to serve these customers with QuickBooks Commerce. So, those are the drivers. And then, the last one I would say is countries where we get the product market fit, like Canada and UK, we have an opportunity to expand the services that we provide and at higher prices and don\u2019t have to discount as much because our names are out there, the experience goes viral, and therefore, more customers want to use it. So, those are the drivers of the mix shift and the ARPC shift, and that\u2019s quite durable.\nScott Schneeberger: And then, as a follow-up, I\u2019m just curious, just from view points on Small Business failures. Obviously, you feel confident enough to give guidance and we\u2019ve heard a lot of good things in discussion of stimulus as well. But, just anecdotally, what are some of the things that you\u2019re seeing, and do you feel that the economy is around the corner, to the extent you can speak for that?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Two things I would say. I think, the most important lever for small businesses is we got to lead thoughtfully through this health crisis, because leading thoughtfully through the health crisis will enable the country and the globe to actually bring jobs back and reduce unemployment. Those are the two largest levers that will impact Small Business failures. And as we talked about at Investor Day, our retention dropped a couple of points because of the failures that we experienced. I think, those two levers that I mentioned, plus a fiscal stimulus, not just more stimulus money but a fiscal stimulus, along with getting out of this health crisis, and ultimately, getting back to lower unemployment is going to really drive the long-term health of small businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore.\nKirk Materne: Sasan, I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper into the sort of announcement today of HubSpot. And maybe just your view on whether or not small businesses are now looking a little bit more for a one-stop shop. I mean, you guys obviously have financials, you added commerce, and this obviously expands you into CRM and marketing with them. So, is the feedback that you\u2019ve been getting that this is, look we want to only to let one vendor to really help us manage our business from customer acquisition through finances, through commerce. I mean, because that\u2019s what it sort of seems like. And do you think the market is moving there in a faster way due to COVID? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. You\u2019re very welcome. I would focus more on the customer pain that we are after. One of the things that we\u2019re really focused on is, one, to help our customers grow; and two, to be able to serve product-based businesses. Because even in service-based businesses, traditionally, we\u2019ve not solved the problem of helping them grow and get more customers well. And so, this integration with HubSpot, with Salesforce is really an example of solving the problem of -- with our platform, we can help you grow your business. We can help you get paid. We can help you do payroll. We can give you access to capital. We can help you with time tracking. Of course, now we can help you set up on multiple different channels and be able to run your product-based business. So, we\u2019re really focused on the customer problem. And one of the things, I preach probably more than that ward wants to hear it at Intuit is, let\u2019s not focus on just creating a one-stop shop because that\u2019s not how a customer think. The customer thinks, I need to solve my problem. Can you solve it for me? With that said, we are seeing more and more customers begin to use our platform to be able to run their business. And we\u2019re seeing more and more customers tell us, hey, can you do some integrations with the following applications to be able to help me grow my business? So, those are the -- it\u2019s very customer-back-driven. And it\u2019s now several years of us being in the cloud where we\u2019re building out the platform to the point where you don\u2019t need to go anywhere else. You can run your entire business on our platform, which is exactly the same thing we\u2019re looking to do on the consumer side. We want a consumer platform where you can do your taxes, get early access to your paycheck, connect the financial products that are right for you and truly reach financial freedom. And so, it really is -- it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re trying to do across the Company for customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Sasan, you\u2019ve talked about QuickBooks business and not raising prices, obviously considering the economic environment we\u2019re in. Do you think that same philosophy will apply to the tax business, or is the tax business different? And do you think there\u2019s some different leverage points and price would be available for the upcoming season?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Kartik, good to hear from you. I would think about this in a couple of dimensions. Both, [Technical Difficulty] and small businesses, we actually now have offerings that are disruptive, and they disrupt higher-priced alternatives. So, when you look at QuickBooks Live, the price that customers have to pay with QuickBooks Live is actually a lot less than what they pay with if they have to go directly and find their own bookkeeper or enrolled agent. And you look at QuickBooks Advanced, we are actually at a disruptive price but yet have a lot of opportunity in terms of what we can do with pricing. Same thing goes for TurboTax Live, where a much lower cost alternative than going to somebody\u2019s home or store to get your taxes done. So, I think the way I would think about it is, there are segments of customers we may intentionally, given the environment, not do price increases, but then there are certain segments of the customers where we will because we\u2019re actually very disruptive and far lower price alternative. So, that\u2019s the way we approach it and think about it internally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs.\nChris Merwin: I think, you all talked about the Online Ecosystem getting back to 30% growth over time. And I guess, if we look at the \u201821 guidance for the segment as a whole and we assume desktop is flat, I think, it wouldn\u2019t buy that QuickBooks Online would be maybe high-teens growth for this coming year. It sounds like the trends are very much getting back on track for QuickBooks Online. So, just curious how we think about the progression back towards 30%-plus growth over time for that segment. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Chris. First of all, as you heard Michelle mention, we have every intention over time to get to back to 30%-plus online revenue growth. And that will happen really by two levers. One is, our continued innovation to deliver value and the portfolio we now have; and two, it\u2019s the recovery of small businesses. Although our platform has demonstrated to be resilient, it\u2019s important to know that we\u2019re not out of this pandemic. And we need to make sure that we get through this health crisis and get unemployment back down and get to a more healthy economy. And I think, the combination of our innovation and getting to a better place in terms of the economy will allow us to get back to that 30%. And a lot of that is what informs the guidance that we provided.\nChris Merwin: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, maybe one just quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Advanced just in terms of how that\u2019s doing relative to your expectations in the current environment. Are you seeing customers holding back on some of the larger system upgrades, say, relative to SMB? I mean -- or is that not the case? Just curious how you\u2019d characterize the strength you\u2019re seeing in that business right now.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I would say it\u2019s actually doing well. At Investor Day, if you recall, we talked about now we have 75,000 customers, and that\u2019s 100% growth year-over-year. And we\u2019re seeing both, customers upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced that are existing customers, and we\u2019re actually seeing new customers come in that have been using a bunch of different apps and manual processes. And they use QuickBooks Advanced, and they see it as an advantage to be able to grow their business. So, we\u2019re actually -- and because it\u2019s disruptive in terms of price versus alternatives, we are not seeing any holdbacks. And we\u2019re actually seeing the benefit of what a platform can do that\u2019s a disruptor, especially those small businesses that are deciding, you know what, me manually running my business is no longer going to work. I need to move to the cloud, especially because of the COVID environment. And QuickBooks Advanced becomes an accelerant.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research.\nMichael Millman: So, if I\u2019ve done the numbers roughly correct, there\u2019s about 100 million taxpayers who pay about $0.25 trillion, that\u2019s -- was a T like TurboTax dollars, for no or zero return. Just kind of wondering with this kind of opportunity maybe for you, what if anything you\u2019re doing now to get some of this money funneled into something that\u2019s earning or Karma Credit -- Credit Karma doing anything? Does the IRS kind of stand up there and say, don\u2019t you dare fool with all this money? Maybe you can help us think about this.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Michael. Let me take a shot at this to see if this addresses your question. First of all, we do see a very large opportunity. But, the way we look at it is that there are about 86 million people that go to somebody else to have their taxes done. And they spend about $20 billion or more to get those taxes done. We just see a huge opportunity to be able to serve those customers with a digital platform where we can bring the help to their place of home or office at their convenience at a much lower price and provide them the confidence that they need to get the maximum refund. So, we do see the same opportunity that you do. Our figures are a bit different than what you were articulating, but that\u2019s really what we are pursuing with our Live platform.\nMichael Millman: I was actually kind of thinking of no refund. Don\u2019t pay more than you need to. Invest that money.\nSasan Goodarzi: Oh, got you. I think, I understand what you\u2019re asking. The whole purpose of our vision of what we want to do to create a consumer finance platform is to give consumers choice. It\u2019s to give them choice to connect to financial products like loans and insurance and credit cards that are right for them. It\u2019s to be able to give them choice when they get their tax refund, if they want to put it in a high-yield savings account, if they want early access to their tax refund, and so actually want early access to their paycheck. To give them more choice because we have the ability with using their data with their permission to give them insights that otherwise they wouldn\u2019t get. Plus, by the way, if they wanted an expert to help them, will provide some advice, we can also help them with that. That\u2019s our vision of what we want to -- what we want to do with our Big Bet three, which is unlock smart money decisions. And of course, that\u2019s where Credit Karma comes in and can really fuel that vision. And we\u2019re excited about it.\nMichael Millman: So, you\u2019re thinking more of after tax payers get a refund, rather than saying you shouldn\u2019t -- there shouldn\u2019t be a refund. You should be using that money more productively than lending it to the IRS?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Well, the refund of the consumers\u2019 money. So, what we\u2019re -- it\u2019s money that\u2019s theirs and they earned it and they should get their refund. It\u2019s about how we help the consumer with what they can do with their refund is really our mission.\nMichael Millman: I see. Okay. And just quickly, the guidance you gave that is before Credit Karma, or does that include Credit Karma?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. That is excluding Credit Karma, because we have not yet closed Credit Karma. And as Michelle mentioned, once we do close Credit Karma, we will actually have another call. And we will update our guidance and it will include Credit Karma.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I\u2019ll be brief. Thank you everyone for your questions. And wish everyone that celebrates Thanksgiving a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving. And we\u2019ll speak to you very soon. And enjoy your holidays. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021: we delivered revenue of $1.3 billion; GAAP operating income of $209 million versus $10 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $334 million versus $129 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75 versus $0.22 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 versus $0.41 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 13% during the quarter. Online Ecosystem revenue was up 24% during the quarter. Growth slowed from Q4, reflecting the lagging impact of lower retention during fiscal 2020 and the lapping of price increases, which began during the middle of Q1 last year. Additionally, Q4 included 4 points of growth from nonrecurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both, customers and ARPC. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. We began lapping a partial quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 17% in fiscal Q1. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payrolls, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 51%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the first quarter, while QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth also reflects the benefit of additional revenues from license updates and tailwinds from previously announced price increases in various products, not fully reflected in the year ago quarter. We do not expect these tailwinds to recur in future quarters. Consumer Group revenue grew 19% in Q1. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY, transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live and disrupt consumer finance. Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 21% in Q1, in line with our expectations. Let me turn to our acquisition of Credit Karma. I'm looking forward to welcoming the Credit Karma team to Intuit, and we're excited about the unprecedented benefits we can deliver for customers. I want to remind you that we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive over time. However, Credit Karma's business was negatively impacted over the last seven months as lenders tightened access to credit due to economic uncertainty related to the pandemic. The business continues to recover after reaching a low point in June, with monthly revenue in October close to pre-COVID levels. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to be modestly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2021 and neutral to modestly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after close in fiscal 2022. We're looking forward to all the innovation that we can deliver together for customers. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, though we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment or directly following the close of the Credit Karma transaction. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $5.8 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We expect to use approximately $3.6 billion of cash to fund part of the consideration for the Credit Karma acquisition. We did not repurchase any stock during the first quarter as we temporarily suspended share purchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition. Approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market in the future. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable January 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. As you may have seen, we reached an agreement to settle the class action litigation regarding the IRS Free File program. We have agreed to pay $40 million to put this matter behind us. By entering into this settlement, which is subject to court approval, we're not admitting any wrongdoing. Also, as I shared at Investor Day, Intuit is the target of a law firm whose standard approach seems to involve making a demand that companies pay a settlement amount to the law firm instead of paying fees associated with arbitration. An increasing number of companies are facing similar attacks by the same law firm. We recorded approximately $10 million in arbitration fees for Q1 of fiscal 2021 and $14 million in fiscal 2020. We'll be disclosing in our 10-Q that Intuit could incur arbitration fees of approximately $400 million related to those claims in future periods. We're in the process of disputing these fees, and we believe this is an abuse of the arbitration system. If the court approves the settlement that I mentioned earlier, we believe it may significantly reduce exposure to mass arbitration claims being brought against us. Moving on to guidance. While macro uncertainty remains, we're growing more confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 8% to 10%, GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.15 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.55. Our fiscal 2021 guidance includes 110 basis points of operating margin expansion, as we're starting to see the leverage of our platform, which I shared at Investor Day. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2021. This compares to a GAAP tax rate of 17% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2020. These increases are driven primarily by state and IRS changes to the R&D tax credit and expected decrease to our excess tax benefits for share-based compensation. This equates to an impact of $0.53 to our GAAP earnings per share and $0.11 to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the higher tax rate. Our Q2 fiscal 2021 guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.89 to $0.92 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.34. You can find our full Q2 and fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. One final note on Q2. We're lapping a full quarter of a price increase in Q2, which we expect to negatively impact Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth by a couple of points. Also, shortly after we close the Credit Karma acquisition, we will hold a call to discuss our revised guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Hi, Ken. Thanks. Going to our financial principles, that really is the long-term commitment that we have and that includes growing revenue double digits and growing operating income faster than revenue. And so, we -- as I mentioned, yes, we do expect to see 110 basis points of expansion, excluding Credit Karma. As I shared at Investor Day, though, as we continue to evolve to more of an AI-driven expert platform, we do see opportunities for margin expansion across the P&L. And those opportunities can be in the areas of technology, where we're increasing the velocity of development on our actual technology platform so we can deliver faster and also using products and services across the company. We also see that in customer success, where we're scaling a common customer success platform, that drives efficiency and effectiveness serving across all products. And then, also in go-to-market, we're able to leverage a common infrastructure so that we can more effectively target customers and manage our sales and marketing processes. So, we do continue to see opportunities for us to expand margin going forward."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Kim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. I hope you are all doing well. We had a very strong start to fiscal year 2021. First quarter revenue grew 14%. Total revenue growth was driven by 13% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, while Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter. This is a great start to the year in a challenging environment, which reinforces the resiliency of our platform. We're growing more confident in how our business is performing in the current environment, although macro uncertainty remains. We continue to see recovering trends across our platform with many QuickBooks indicators back to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, I'm happy to announce that we will provide guidance for fiscal year 2021, which Michelle will cover in more detail later. At our September Investor Day, we shared the acceleration of innovation, driven by our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our 5 Big Bets, highlighting our growth potential. During the Platform Immersion Experience, we demonstrated progress against each Big Bet. What I'd like to do is highlight a few of the innovations and cover Big Bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and it's foundational to the other bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. We grew the number of TurboTax Live customers on our platform at nearly 70% last season while increasing our expert product recommendation scores by 4 points. The team is hard at work as we prepare for the season ahead. We're also proud of the progress we've made with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. We already have more than 600 experts serving customers today, with some of these experts serving both Taps and small business customers. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We expect our pending acquisition of Credit Karma to be more important than ever as we work to help consumers save money, get out of debt and have faster access to money. We expect to complete the acquisition before the end of this calendar year. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow. QuickBooks Cash helps small businesses manage working capital by providing visibility into their financial picture while providing them with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them, all while leveraging the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We launched QuickBooks Commerce in September to better serve the 1 million product-based businesses on our platform by providing inventory and order management tools they need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. We've also identified 6.4 million product-based businesses in the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia that could benefit from this solution. And we'll innovate with high velocity to take advantage of this market opportunity. It's still early with both QuickBooks Cash and Commerce, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced and the features that we're introducing to individually tailor the offering to the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We doubled our QuickBooks Online Advanced customers to 75,000 in fiscal year 2020, and we're continuing to build on this momentum. We continue to pursue our premium app strategy and introduced integrations with Salesforce and HubSpot. We now have two of the largest CRM solutions available for our customers. And finally, our first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, enables us to put more money in our customers' pocket, to eliminate friction and deliver confidence in every touch point by using AI and customer insights. Last year, we increased use of AI and increased the number of model deployed across our platform by over 50%, tripled the speed of delivery on our modern development platform and increased mobile application deployments by 60%. We're building on this momentum this year as we innovate rapidly to solve our customers' biggest problems. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. We also believe the current environment continues to act as an accelerant to these bets. Most everyone is looking for virtual solutions. Small businesses are accelerating their shift to online and omnichannel commerce. And both, consumers and small businesses are looking for ways to put more money in their pockets. So, to wrap up, I'm excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. And now, let me turn it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. Team, I'm very proud of our organization and all that we've accomplished together, and I'm very optimistic about the future. So with that, let's now open it up to your questions. Yes. Hey, Ken. Good to hear from you. I think, the best way I would describe it is, one, we're actually seeing how resilient our platform is and how small businesses are using our platform in this pandemic. I think to -- because of that, it just gives us confidence, as we look ahead in terms of how small businesses are going to be able to maneuver through this current environment. So, we're primarily going off of the key indicators that we see that are both,, leading and lagging, and that is really what has given us confidence to provide the guidance that we've given. Of course, we'll have to wait and see how things play out with the health crisis and the impact of the economic crisis. But given just what we're seeing in our business, that's really what's informed our guidance that we shared today. Yes. Sure, Keith. Good to hear from you. First of all, we do have pretty high confidence that we will close Credit Karma by the end of calendar year. So, that's the first point. I think, the second point is, as you know, we don't comment on rumors. But, it's important to reinforce that the whole premise behind the Credit Karma acquisition was what we could do together to create a consumer finance platform, and it wasn't for the tax business. And so, I think, I will just leave it at that. But nevertheless, we're really excited and can't wait to close this, so we can start doing amazing things together for consumers. Yes. Hey Keith, thanks for calling me out, buddy. In terms of your question, it's interesting timing. We had QuickBooks Connect yesterday, which is where we have thousands of small businesses and accountants and partners together. And of course, this one was far, far bigger than it ever has been because it was all virtual. And we rolled out a lot of our innovation. But particularly, to answer your question, we also rolled out QuickBooks Commerce and QuickBooks Cash to our customer base or at least gave visibility and awareness. And the feedback was just through the roof. Because if I start with accountants, accountants were very excited because now they can recommend QuickBooks to product-based businesses, and they love how QuickBooks Commerce works for product-based businesses, and they love the fact that they can, in essence, help a small business run their business through the platform. And two small businesses that were product-based businesses, they love Commerce, and by the way, we got raving reviews on QuickBooks Cash, and it's just a simple app where you can send and receive money to be able to run your business. And so, I would say from a positioning standpoint, we're not doing anything differently in terms of going up against others. What we're really focused on is the customer problem and how we're raising awareness. And in fact, our team has done some great work in the months and the year ahead, what you'll see is we'll be, in essence, going to market with digital assets that helps small businesses understand that we can truly be the source of truth for their entire business versus the source of truth for their books and from an accounting lens. And so, it's more about what we're doing to raise awareness and shape the market versus doing anything differently, given who we're going up against because it's, frankly no different than what it's been in the past. Yes. Sure, Michael. Very good to hear from you. First of all, as we talked about last quarter, our biggest uncertainty was around the macro environment and the impact to small businesses and how our platform would perform in the times of uncertainty. So, we've just learned a ton. One, all the credit to small businesses in terms of just their passion to do whatever it takes to survive; but then two, us better understanding how they use the platform to be able to deliver for customers. And so, given that and given that we started experiencing businesses opening across the Company and our confidence is at an improved level than it was a quarter ago. With that said, to your question around tax, we're bullish about our strategy, and we've continued to be bullish based on the results that we're seeing. And particularly, it's driven by two primary areas. One, it's who we focus on; and then, the second is the how. So, who we focus on is, we've doubled down several years ago on serving investors, serving self-employed and serving the Latinx market, all of which we are underpenetrated. And then, two, really going after the market, the assisted market, and those that are looking for more confidence with TurboTax Live. And so, although our comps compared to last year are tough comps, we do have confidence in our execution, our trajectory. And that's really what informed the guidance that we provided. All right. Thank you very much. Yes. Hi, Jennifer. Good to hear from you. It's both. Very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day. We continue to see strength in the UK and Canada. And we're seeing some of the emerging markets that we're focused on, like Brazil and France, really start their acceleration even in this current environment. And so, really, it's a combination of being very-focused on who we pursue with what products we pursue and then also really intentional about pricing, and frankly, a lot less discounting, especially in places like Canada and UK, where we created a network effect with small businesses using us, recommending us, with accountants using us and recommending us. And so, we don't have to discount as much to get our name known. So, it's very similar to what we talked about, which is it's a combination of customer growth and ARPC growth. And the ARPC growth is a lot to do with what we're selling and a lot less discounting. Yes, sure. Just for a quick context, there are a couple of areas where we felt like we needed to double down in context of the bets that we've declared. It's the type of talent that we're pursuing, both in creating a modern operations and our customer success, but also the type of experts that we want to bring into customer success. And then, in technology, it was more systems engineers, infrastructure engineers, cloud engineers that have lots of experience in building complex systems in the cloud. And we are aggressively hiring in those areas because they ultimately are very important in serving the bets that I talked about earlier and a lot of our innovation, we've been talking about like commerce, cash advance, et cetera. So, we feel good about our hiring ramp. And I think, I would just really focus on the guidance that Michelle talked about, which includes about 110 basis points of margin expansion. And all of our approach to hiring is all embedded in the guidance that we provided. Yes. They're actually the tailwinds -- or the headwinds are in three buckets. One is, overall, as we shared at Investor Day, our retention dropped by a couple of points based on what we saw in the March, April, May timeframe. That, along with lapping a price increase and actually not taking price action deliberately, plus the impact from acquisitions in those same months, is really what impacted our growth rate for the quarter that you see here. And our view is, effective the second quarter will be probably the lowest point of the year for the Small Business Group for the same exact reasons that I just mentioned. As you know, we don't break out quarterly attrition and retention rates. We share once a year at Investor Day. So, those are the main drivers of it. Yes. Sure, Brent. Good to hear from you. In terms of the shape of the recovery, it's actually quite consistent with what we shared at Investor Day. May -- most of our indicators are back to pre-pandemic levels, but charge volume is still several points lower. The number of companies running payroll is still several points lower. So although things have recovered, the reality is things are still below pre-pandemic levels. I think, where we have more confidence, Brent, is now we are actually seeing how our platform is -- really how resilient it is and how it's delivering benefits for customers in these very tough times, plus the innovation that we have across the platform. So, just seeing how our platform is playing out and seeing the impact of our innovation is actually what gives us even more confidence. And from a recovery standpoint, not much has changed in the last six weeks and what we shared at Investor Day. To turn to your second question, we're actually -- when you think about transforming the assisted segment and really helping customers do their taxes with confidence, there are those that choose to do it themselves. But, at one point in time, they may want to hit a button and get an expert to come, talk to them, review their return to gain confidence. So, those that from the beginning may choose to have help along the way and pick TurboTax Live as an actual offering right off the bat. And then, there are those that may start and decide, you know what, I just want you to do my taxes for me, which is a lot of what we were testing in the last several months. And our plan is to actually launch the platform with all of those capabilities come -- this coming tax season, which by the way is right around the corner. Yes. Siti, good to hear from you, and a really good question. As I mentioned, there are a few of our key metrics that have recovered quite nicely, but they're still below the pre-COVID levels like charge volume and payroll. Acquisition is one that's actually rebounded quite nicely, and we're actually benefiting from some of what you shared, which is more new business formation. So, that's probably a metric above and beyond all of them that is probably more in the green, and we're benefiting from some of that recovery. Yes. Sure, Yao, good to hear from me and very good question. Two things I would say. One is, we are actually very intentionally qualifying customers on top of the funnel to ensure that we only bring in customers that we can deliver against their expectations, given just we literally just launched the platform. Interesting enough, one thing that we're seeing is customers want to use it so bad, they go back to the top of the funnel and change their answers, so they can qualify for it. So, the demand is quite high. I think, you may have fallen into one of our test cells. There's a lot of different things that we're testing, different business models, different pricing. So, I don't know exactly what you fell into, but it sounds like you fell into a test cell. Yes. The stimulus, I would say, no pun intended, is not really going to be a big stimulus for small businesses. It's not going to make a difference between them going out of business or not. I'll hit on one element of your question, which is the range of the guidance. The low end of the guidance is really driven from how restrictive the states becomes, how restrictive the country becomes beyond what we're all seeing, which is you now no longer -- although every x state is a little different, you no longer can go into a fitness center, it's only if it's outside. You can't go eat inside at all. Now schools like the New York public schools just closed again. So, everybody has to go from home. That has implications to the local economy. So, the low end of the guidance is more how restrictive things get and then the impact on small businesses, because we feel quite confident in our execution. And of course, the high end is the -- I would say the trends that we're experiencing and seeing right now. That's how we thought about it. Sure. Arvind, good to hear from you. Let me just play back to your question because you were cutting in and out. I want to make sure I'm answering the question that you're asking. I think, your question was, we talked about revenue per customer increasing at Investor Day, and you were just wondering how we plan to achieve that. Did I play that back correctly? Great. I would say a couple of uber messages. The first one is, it's because of the incredible innovation and the acceleration of the innovation from the team that's really going after delivering benefits that that customers care about most. So, if I decompose that with a couple of examples, what I would share is, QuickBooks Live is -- has the potential to increase revenue per customer. The volume is not, of course, at the same rate, but the revenue per customer is. When you look at QuickBooks Advanced, which comes with it serving much larger customers, that has an opportunity and does move the needle when it comes to revenue per customer. And then, there's the services, the services that go with QuickBooks Live, the services that go with QuickBooks Advanced.  And then, within all the services that we provide, payments, payroll, TSheets and now with the integration of TSheets and Payroll Full Service, these services and the innovation and the impact themselves also deliver more revenue per customer. So, when you put all of those together, those are the biggest drivers of increased revenue per customer, which is just driven by the innovation that the team is delivering for customers. I think, it's just another important innovation and benefit for customers on our QuickBooks Advanced platform. Again, when you think about these customers -- because I'm assuming you're talking about like HubSpot and Salesforce. And these customers that are between 10 to 100 employees, and even larger than that. They are looking for CRM solutions. So, we invested quite a bit of time with, I'll use HubSpot as an example, to really deeply integrate. In fact, I was reviewing the demo several days ago, and it's a really cool experience for our customers. So, this is -- it just positions us and allows us to not only serve our existing customers with QuickBooks Advanced, but also penetrate and get new customers. Sure, Scott. I'll jump in, and if there's anything Michelle wants that she can jump in. It's very similar to what I just shared with Arvind. First of all, I'll start with the headline that it's very sustainable. We're just getting started. And when you look at the mix that gets driven by the platform with QuickBooks Live, it gets -- another one is QuickBooks Advanced. And both of these come with them services, like payments and payroll and TSheets, and then apps like HubSpot, as an example, that allows us to drive a mix shift. And so, those are just examples. And then, QuickBooks Commerce, which really gives us the opportunity to serve product-based businesses that we served for years in desktop, the million product-based services that we have on desktop. Now we have an opportunity to serve these customers with QuickBooks Commerce. So, those are the drivers. And then, the last one I would say is countries where we get the product market fit, like Canada and UK, we have an opportunity to expand the services that we provide and at higher prices and don't have to discount as much because our names are out there, the experience goes viral, and therefore, more customers want to use it. So, those are the drivers of the mix shift and the ARPC shift, and that's quite durable. Sure. Two things I would say. I think, the most important lever for small businesses is we got to lead thoughtfully through this health crisis, because leading thoughtfully through the health crisis will enable the country and the globe to actually bring jobs back and reduce unemployment. Those are the two largest levers that will impact Small Business failures. And as we talked about at Investor Day, our retention dropped a couple of points because of the failures that we experienced. I think, those two levers that I mentioned, plus a fiscal stimulus, not just more stimulus money but a fiscal stimulus, along with getting out of this health crisis, and ultimately, getting back to lower unemployment is going to really drive the long-term health of small businesses. Yes. You're very welcome. I would focus more on the customer pain that we are after. One of the things that we're really focused on is, one, to help our customers grow; and two, to be able to serve product-based businesses. Because even in service-based businesses, traditionally, we've not solved the problem of helping them grow and get more customers well. And so, this integration with HubSpot, with Salesforce is really an example of solving the problem of -- with our platform, we can help you grow your business. We can help you get paid. We can help you do payroll. We can give you access to capital. We can help you with time tracking. Of course, now we can help you set up on multiple different channels and be able to run your product-based business. So, we're really focused on the customer problem. And one of the things, I preach probably more than that ward wants to hear it at Intuit is, let's not focus on just creating a one-stop shop because that's not how a customer think. The customer thinks, I need to solve my problem. Can you solve it for me? With that said, we are seeing more and more customers begin to use our platform to be able to run their business. And we're seeing more and more customers tell us, hey, can you do some integrations with the following applications to be able to help me grow my business? So, those are the -- it's very customer-back-driven. And it's now several years of us being in the cloud where we're building out the platform to the point where you don't need to go anywhere else. You can run your entire business on our platform, which is exactly the same thing we're looking to do on the consumer side. We want a consumer platform where you can do your taxes, get early access to your paycheck, connect the financial products that are right for you and truly reach financial freedom. And so, it really is -- it's consistent with what we're trying to do across the Company for customers. Yes. Kartik, good to hear from you. I would think about this in a couple of dimensions. Both, [Technical Difficulty] and small businesses, we actually now have offerings that are disruptive, and they disrupt higher-priced alternatives. So, when you look at QuickBooks Live, the price that customers have to pay with QuickBooks Live is actually a lot less than what they pay with if they have to go directly and find their own bookkeeper or enrolled agent. And you look at QuickBooks Advanced, we are actually at a disruptive price but yet have a lot of opportunity in terms of what we can do with pricing. Same thing goes for TurboTax Live, where a much lower cost alternative than going to somebody's home or store to get your taxes done. So, I think the way I would think about it is, there are segments of customers we may intentionally, given the environment, not do price increases, but then there are certain segments of the customers where we will because we're actually very disruptive and far lower price alternative. So, that's the way we approach it and think about it internally. Yes. Sure, Chris. First of all, as you heard Michelle mention, we have every intention over time to get to back to 30%-plus online revenue growth. And that will happen really by two levers. One is, our continued innovation to deliver value and the portfolio we now have; and two, it's the recovery of small businesses. Although our platform has demonstrated to be resilient, it's important to know that we're not out of this pandemic. And we need to make sure that we get through this health crisis and get unemployment back down and get to a more healthy economy. And I think, the combination of our innovation and getting to a better place in terms of the economy will allow us to get back to that 30%. And a lot of that is what informs the guidance that we provided. Yes. I would say it's actually doing well. At Investor Day, if you recall, we talked about now we have 75,000 customers, and that's 100% growth year-over-year. And we're seeing both, customers upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced that are existing customers, and we're actually seeing new customers come in that have been using a bunch of different apps and manual processes. And they use QuickBooks Advanced, and they see it as an advantage to be able to grow their business. So, we're actually -- and because it's disruptive in terms of price versus alternatives, we are not seeing any holdbacks. And we're actually seeing the benefit of what a platform can do that's a disruptor, especially those small businesses that are deciding, you know what, me manually running my business is no longer going to work. I need to move to the cloud, especially because of the COVID environment. And QuickBooks Advanced becomes an accelerant. Sure, Michael. Let me take a shot at this to see if this addresses your question. First of all, we do see a very large opportunity. But, the way we look at it is that there are about 86 million people that go to somebody else to have their taxes done. And they spend about $20 billion or more to get those taxes done. We just see a huge opportunity to be able to serve those customers with a digital platform where we can bring the help to their place of home or office at their convenience at a much lower price and provide them the confidence that they need to get the maximum refund. So, we do see the same opportunity that you do. Our figures are a bit different than what you were articulating, but that's really what we are pursuing with our Live platform. Oh, got you. I think, I understand what you're asking. The whole purpose of our vision of what we want to do to create a consumer finance platform is to give consumers choice. It's to give them choice to connect to financial products like loans and insurance and credit cards that are right for them. It's to be able to give them choice when they get their tax refund, if they want to put it in a high-yield savings account, if they want early access to their tax refund, and so actually want early access to their paycheck. To give them more choice because we have the ability with using their data with their permission to give them insights that otherwise they wouldn't get. Plus, by the way, if they wanted an expert to help them, will provide some advice, we can also help them with that. That's our vision of what we want to -- what we want to do with our Big Bet three, which is unlock smart money decisions. And of course, that's where Credit Karma comes in and can really fuel that vision. And we're excited about it. Yes. Well, the refund of the consumers' money. So, what we're -- it's money that's theirs and they earned it and they should get their refund. It's about how we help the consumer with what they can do with their refund is really our mission. Yes. That is excluding Credit Karma, because we have not yet closed Credit Karma. And as Michelle mentioned, once we do close Credit Karma, we will actually have another call. And we will update our guidance and it will include Credit Karma. Yes. I'll be brief. Thank you everyone for your questions. And wish everyone that celebrates Thanksgiving a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving. And we'll speak to you very soon. And enjoy your holidays. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins, please begin.\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Chelsea. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter, ending the year with momentum as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to be focused on solving our customers\u2019 biggest problems by putting more money in their pocket, eliminating work and saving people time and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make. Full year revenue reached $12.7 billion, up 32%, including the addition of Mailchimp and a full year of Credit Karma. Excluding MailChimp, revenue grew 24%. Total revenue growth was fueled by 38% growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which includes 16 points from Mailchimp. Consumer Group revenue grew 10%, and Credit Karma had an outstanding year with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year. I am very proud of the team\u2019s performance, delivering strong growth and strong margins, which very few companies at our scale are able to achieve. I\u2019m optimistic about our strategy and opportunities for growth, especially considering an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. The Intuit platform remains mission-critical for powering our customers\u2019 prosperity. I\u2019m pleased we are guiding to another year of strong revenue growth and strong margins in fiscal year 2023. Our global AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize keep the benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. We will share more on our vision and the outcomes we\u2019re driving across each of these Big Bets next month at our Investor Day. Now let me turn to a topic that I know is top of mind for many of you, the resiliency of our business and the slowing macroeconomic environment. Our company is in a significantly different position than it was during the last recession more than a decade ago. Our platform and cloud-based offerings have significantly expanded to become the platform of choice for consumers and small businesses. Therefore, Intuit is even more mission-critical for our customers we serve. We have highly predictable reoccurring revenue and much of our business is subscription-based. Additionally, the scale of our platform along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators, such as growth in charge volume, number of hours employees are working and number of workers paid, bank account balances of our small business customers, credit card utilization and delinquency rates for members. This allows us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. Let me share how we think about our business in context of a mild recession. To start, in fiscal year 2022, 51% of our revenue came from the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 35% from our Consumer and ProTax businesses and 14% from Credit Karma. First on tax, our tax businesses are very resilient, and we do not expect a mild recession to have any significant impact. Next, with Small Business and Self-Employed Group, QuickBooks and Mailchimp are mission-critical for our customers whose livelihood depends on our platform. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 80% of the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue was subscription-based. As a reminder, Mailchimp is also primarily subscription-based which adds to the scale of our subscription volume. The approximately 20% is transactional-based and includes revenue from QuickBooks payments, capital and per employee pricing for time tracking and payroll. In a mild recessionary environment, we may see an impact on these transactional businesses. In Q4, we did not see any impact. This demonstrates how mission-critical our platform is, especially in this environment. Finally, turning to Credit Karma. This is the business that could be most impacted by weakening economic environment. As a reminder, this business represents 14% of Intuit\u2019s revenue in fiscal year 2022. While we expect member engagement to be strong in any economic environment, our financial institution partners could tighten access to credit. In Q4, we experienced increased volatility in personal loans. Many partners that securitized loans are facing a more challenging funding environment as interest rates rise. For context, personal loans represent just over a third of Credit Karma\u2019s revenue in fiscal year 2022. Although several personal loan partners tightened underwriting during the quarter, we were able to offset some of this with volume from other partners. This demonstrates the power of the platform. In credit cards, we have not seen any significant impact. We continue to monitor delinquency rates, which we view as a leading indicator for future credit card origination trends. While delinquency rates have increased slightly, they remain near historical lows. We expect credit cards to be less negatively impacted by a mild recession than personal loans. In the mild recession of \u201801-02, credit card originations declined only a few points. And for context, credit cards represent nearly half of credit card revenue in fiscal year 2022. We do expect Lightbox to continue to be a differentiator for Credit Karma as this technology allows lenders to deploy their targeting models in an encrypted environment and leverage thousands of anonymized financial attributes related to Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. This provides more certainty to members and partners on the platform as recommendations are personalized. Currently, no one else can replicate this. Partners usage of Lightbox at the end of fiscal year 2022 was at an all-time high, representing nearly 70% of credit card and personal loan transactions on a combined basis. This was up nearly 15 points from the prior year. We expect Lightbox to help make Credit Karma\u2019s business more resilient in a recessionary environment. Now with that as context, the guidance we are providing today assumes current demand trends continue. Wrapping up, we feel more confident than ever in our long-term business strategy. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important and mission-critical than ever. As part of our 3 and 1-year plan that the Board just approved, we are investing heavily in innovation within each of our Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers while delivering top line growth and margin expansion given the strength of our operational playbook. Combined with our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, Intuit remains in a position of strength. We\u2019re proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, down 6%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year, partially offset by the addition of Mailchimp; GAAP operating loss of $75 million versus operating income of $402 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $433 million versus $715 million last year; GAAP loss per share of $0.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 versus $1.97 last year. You can find our full fiscal 2022 results in our press release and on our fact sheet. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 41% during the quarter and 20% on an organic basis, excluding $265 million in Mailchimp revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 38% and 22% on an organic basis. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 66% in Q4 or 32% excluding Mailchimp and 61% for the full year or 34% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 33%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking grew 116% in fiscal Q4. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 29%. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online Services revenue grew 107%. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 34%. Mailchimp revenue included in Online Services was $265 million. Although we are making progress with this business as we accelerated our year-over-year revenue growth several points in fiscal Q4 versus when we closed the acquisition in fiscal Q2, revenue was slightly below our expectations. During the quarter, we focused on product innovation to improve conversion ahead of peak season, which starts in September, and therefore, pulled back on marketing investments. I am confident that these are the right steps to position us well as we head into Mailchimp peak season. We expect to ramp up marketing in September after these enhancements are complete. We continue to have confidence in our game plan and acceleration priorities for Mailchimp. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in Payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offering. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 193% in fiscal Q4 and 23% on an organic basis excluding MailChimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits in fiscal 2022 driven by price increases and customer growth. Nearly all of our desktop accounting revenue is now subscription-based, similar to our online accounting offerings. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 17% to $475 million in Q4, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. Full year revenue was $1.8 billion. We\u2019ve had 2 exceptional years for this business, growing 37% in fiscal 2021 and 58% in fiscal 2022 on a pro forma basis, well above our longer-term expectations of 20% to 25%. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards and personal loans. This was partially offset by headwinds in auto insurance and home loans. As Sasan shared earlier, we are seeing increased volatility in personal loans. We continue developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue was $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10%. I\u2019m proud of our execution this season as we grew share and average revenue per return. Turning to the ProConnect Group. We reported $546 million in revenue for fiscal 2022, up 6%. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $508 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion during fiscal 2022. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving the company a total authorization of $3.5 billion to repurchase shares. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable October 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. As a nearly 40-year-old company, we\u2019ve been through many economic cycles. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The economic environment was a consideration as we look ahead. We have identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios based on where we see opportunities across our platform. Many of these can be pulled in real time should the need arise in areas like marketing spend, travel, hiring and others as we progress through the year in order to maintain earnings power while positioning the company for a stronger future. We have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense in any macro environment. These principles are intended to accelerate our innovation in the future, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from any downturn in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes revenue of $14.5 billion to $14.7 billion, growth of 14% to 16%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 19% to 20% for Small Business and Self-employed, 9% to 10% for the Consumer segment and 10% to 15% for Credit Karma. As a reminder, Credit Karma grew 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year in fiscal 2022, well ahead of our long-term expectation of 20% to 25%. Our overall guidance assumes recent demand trends continue. Our guidance also includes GAAP earnings per share of $6.92 to $7.22, non-GAAP earnings per share of $13.59 to $13.89. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 25% in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes stock-based compensation of $1.8 billion, an increase of 39% over fiscal 2022. Approximately 25% of this total is equity granted as part of the Credit Karma and Mailchimp transactions, and approximately 75% of this total is related to our broad-based equity program designed to attract, retain and incentivize employees. Looking ahead, we expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to flatten over the next few years. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 23% to 25%, GAAP loss per share of $0.43 to $0.37 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.20. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2023 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Going forward, we are bringing Mint and Credit Karma together under a unified personal finance strategy. Starting in fiscal Q1, we will be reporting Mint as part of the Credit Karma segment. This is reflected in the guidance I shared today but is not material to the growth rate. I also want to share an important change regarding our long-term expectations for Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth going forward. In the past, we shared with you our aspiration to achieve Online Ecosystem revenue growth of better than 30% organically over time. We first provided this expectation in fiscal 2017 when our Online Ecosystem revenue was $850 million. It comprised less than one-third of our small business ecosystem, and we were early in our journey building our online presence. Today, the Online Ecosystem is over 5x larger at $4.4 billion, and it comprised more than two-thirds of total small business revenue in fiscal 2022. This, along with the fact that the majority of the business, is now subscription-based given the shift to subscription in desktop. We believe the right measure moving forward is to look at the performance of our overall business rather than just the Online Ecosystem. We now expect total Small Business and Self-Employed long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20%, up from 10% to 15% previously. While the Online Ecosystem will continue to be our growth catalyst, we will no longer provide specific Online Ecosystem goals. With that, I will turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Michelle, thank you. As you have now heard from Michelle and I we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We have a large TAM, secular shifts working in our favor and a highly predictable set of revenue streams. Our innovation is unlocking new opportunities for our platform and delivering truly game-changing benefits for our customers. Intuit remains a best place to work around the world, and I\u2019m proud of the team and what we\u2019ve accomplished this year. Now let me turn it over to you for any questions that you may have.\nKim Watkins: Chelsea, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. Michelle, I think this is more of a question for you. For the FY \u201823 guide, you\u2019re looking for operating margins to continue to move higher or just to move higher from where they were in FY \u201822. Part of that is just kind of anniversarying the legal settlement on those part of FY \u201822. Can you talk to us about sort of the organic, if you will, or sort of like the fundamental margin improvement that you\u2019re expecting in the business in FY \u201823? How big is that and how durable on a go-forward basis if we think about the model like beyond FY \u201823? Is this a progression that we could see being more durable in terms of driving operating efficiencies, number one? And number two, in your remarks about finding levers in the business, the one that really stuck out to me is saying \u2013 you said there is levers to maintain the earnings power. So should I take that to mean that a lot of those levers have to do with the OpEx side of the equation, that there is levers you could pull to maintain margins and maintain profitability even in a weaker macro environment, if you will? Thank you.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks for your questions. Appreciate it. Yes, we are very happy to see our operating margin guidance for this coming year. It implies margin expansion of 100 basis points versus FY \u201822. And as you know, that aligns to our financial principles to be able to grow revenue double digits and operating income dollars faster than revenue. So we feel really good about that. As we look at where that\u2019s really coming from, as we\u2019ve been continuing to grow more and more as a platform over time, that really does enable us to look across the business and be able to drive efficiencies and effectiveness while driving accelerated revenue growth, which is resulting in our ability to expand margins while being able to continue to invest to really drive the accelerated revenue growth. As to how we think about that, I don\u2019t really see anything that really structurally that impacts that over time. We haven\u2019t given any longer-term expectations or long-term guidance on what margins might look like in the longer-term, but I don\u2019t necessarily see anything really structurally that prevents us \u2013 as we continue to grow as a platform that prevents us from continuing that growth. To the second part of your question as for the levers that we would pull, yes, I mean, there are a number of things that we would pull, which could be OpEx. As I mentioned, there is marketing spend or travel, hiring, other things like that, that we can pull pretty much in \u2013 a lot of those in real time to be able to impact our operating expenses and be able to maintain the margins that we have committed to. So we want to be ready. It\u2019s really kind of what we do on a day-to-day basis. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to drive different efficiencies across the business.\nKeith Weiss: Awesome. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much. And congrats on strong fiscal year and a strong guide for next year. Maybe for my first question, with Mailchimp a bit disappointing, can you double-click on the actions you\u2019re taking? And what it is that gives you the confidence, its product and not the environment?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Brad, how are you? I\u2019ll take that question. First and foremost, I would share with you that we are the ones that pulled back that resulted in the performance that we just shared. So the great news is it\u2019s in our control. The second point I would make is the biggest thing that\u2019s been reaffirmed as we\u2019ve been \u2013 become one family with Mailchimp is two of the biggest problems that matters most to our customers and especially, by the way, in tougher times is being able to grow their customer base and being able to manage their cash flow. And the biggest insight that we learned as we started accelerating our marketing spend, which we had shared with all of you that we would do, is that there are conversion on gaps in the product that we felt like were critical to address and not just spend the marketing dollars without the benefit of improved conversion. And specifically, those were things like coming to the website and the number of people that we saw falling off versus what we would expect based on our experience with across the QuickBooks platform, across the Credit Karma platform, the TurboTax platform, what we believe are some best-in-class engagement and conversion. Then when you get into the product, we measure active use and making sure that you\u2019re getting into the features that you really wanted to get into and hence why you signed up for Mailchimp and even our checkout process. So those are just three illustrative examples of what I would say just basic blocking and tackling product conversion that we really wanted to double down on to make sure that we are ready for busy season. That did not take away from the priorities that we have shared about Mailchimp, which is one is to create one growth platform with QuickBooks, which we are on track to do. Two, it\u2019s a double down on international. In fact, it is now part of our refreshed international strategy to double down on helping customers grow customers with Mailchimp. And then the third is to actually go into mid-market. So what we just announced in terms of our results actually has nothing to do with the environment. It has everything to do with what\u2019s in our control and decisions that we made very explicitly to be ready for busy season. And these are playbooks that we know how to execute when it comes to product conversion.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you. That makes a lot of sense, Sasan. And maybe if I can follow-up with a quick one for Michelle, Michelle, just on the long-term guidance and how we\u2019re thinking about small business going forward, and you talked about a range of 15% to 20% growth versus \u2013 from 10% to 15% but thinking more holistically. Just as I think about some of the pricing actions more recently in desktop, for example, can you just remind us, as you think about that long-term view, how should we think about pricing as a lever and pricing for value going forward? Thank you.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hi, Brad. Thanks for the question. We\u2019re really excited about being able to raise the long-term expectations for small business from 10% to 15% to 15% to 20%. I just think it goes to show, as Sasan talked about earlier, really the mission-critical nature of the products and the offerings that we have in small business. As we have increased the growth expectations, the growth algorithm overall is really still focused on the same things. It\u2019s about driving customers and it\u2019s about driving ARPC. Yes, pricing may be part of ARPC, but really, it is about focusing on driving value and how do we continue to provide offerings for customers that may have a higher ARPC, whether it\u2019s QBO Advanced, QuickBooks Live, those kinds of products. And we really are focused on pricing for value, so not just continually raising price. But once we\u2019re delivering those additional features that are providing additional value to the customers and we\u2019re bringing more innovation to the table, then we look at really should we be raising the price. But overall, very excited about the growth we see with small business.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much and thanks for taking the question. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. One other thing that \u2013 just amplifying what Michelle just shared, and that is our reliance on price has not changed, meaning that we have an algorithm whereby price is just an element of our overall performance. And we\u2019re not relying more on price looking ahead than we did looking backwards. So just reiterating one point that Michelle made just a moment ago?\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess \u2013 so one bigger-picture kind of question, and then just one on tax. As we parse the numbers, I think the surprise factor sitting here is the guidance. And it\u2019s surprising in that it feels like it\u2019s not that conservative, I guess. And Sasan, I want to press on that a little bit. I think what you\u2019re saying is that, look, you guys have a lot of forward-looking indicators into the macro environment. And you\u2019re looking at those indicators, and they were really good in the quarter. And then I think you mentioned in your script that your guidance does not assume significant deterioration in those factors. So I guess my first question would be, why not? And why \u2013 what gives you the confidence to guide with that methodology? And then if you \u2013 what level \u2013 if you did add conservatism into the guidance for next year, where would we find it? And just tactically, maybe what is the assumption for Mailchimp growth given that variability you talked about that was a choice, I guess, in the quarter?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Alex. Appreciate the question. I\u2019ll say a couple of things. First of all, our approach to how we run the company and our approach to guidance and how we factor things in has not at all changed. So just know that our approach is consistent with the way Intuit has always set expectations and set guidance, which is really to deliver on our commitment. That\u2019s the number one. Number two, what really informed our perspective as we look ahead is all of the indicators that we see that are forward-looking. But let me just \u2013 if I could double-click in, in a few of the areas. I\u2019ll start with tax to put that out of the way, which is no matter the environment, we\u2019re not going to expect nor have we seen in our history really any material impact in tax. That\u2019s 35% of the company. When you look at the other 51% of the company, which is small business, it\u2019s important to note that we are a very different company today than we were 3 years ago, much less 5 years ago, where small businesses are relying on our platform to run their businesses, actually their livelihood. And 80% of our revenue is subscription. And the 20% of that is transactional-based. We take the current environment and how things could play out into account as we set guidance. And the third, which is Credit Karma and 14% of the overall company revenue, we have taken the current environment and what we assume will take place into account. And most of our verticals other than Credit Karma, in fact, have seen an impact, and we have included that in our guidance. So really, that was a long way of saying we are fairly consistent across all of our segments. And we feel very good about the indicators that we see, how we view things will play out and how that informed our guidance moving forward.\nAlex Zukin: That\u2019s helpful. It sounds like you\u2019re reaffirming a notion of diversification and exposure. I guess, maybe just a follow-up. On the tax side, on the Consumer business, when you think about \u2013 I mean you mentioned that business is kind of much more resilient irrespective of the macro, everybody\u2019s doing their taxes. Is there any impact we should think about from recent legislation and just in general, the type of a tax season that a more volatile macroeconomic recession might \u2013 or environment might instigate?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Alex, I would say nothing more than what we\u2019ve experienced in the last couple of years. That\u2019s really the short answer. When you look at the last 2 to 3 years, environmentally, it has had probably more of an impact in the tax business than we\u2019ve seen in years. And as you know, I\u2019ve been with the company for 17 years plus, ran the tax business for 3 years. And what happened when we hit COVID, the implication on consumers, the extend the tax season, the child tax credit, there are so many things that played into the tax season in the last several years. And as we look at the year ahead, frankly, we view a much more simplified approach to the tax season. Although some of the tax laws will impact what we need to do in the product, that\u2019s what we\u2019re great at. That\u2019s what we know how to do well. So we actually see more normality as we look ahead than we experienced in the last 2 to 3 years.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Can\u2019t argue with the results, guys. Congratulations.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hi, congratulations on a super finish to the fiscal year and also a very constructive guidance. Sasan or Michelle, when you look at the \u2013 I know you\u2019re not going to be talking about the Small Business-Online Ecosystem revenue split going forward. but it clearly looks like the business is at a point where you have two-thirds of the business coming from Online Ecosystem that\u2019s growing roughly 30% plus range, right? I think many of us are surprised that the outlook for that business, you raised the overall business at 15% to 20%. So it looks like Online Ecosystem is actually doing pretty decently, right? So in the event of a downturn \u2013 I know, Sasan, this was a question that I\u2019ve asked you on prior conference calls. But how confident are you that \u2013 of course, retaining subs is one thing, but then adding net new subscribers in a challenging economy, how confident are you that you can keep that ball rolling while continuing to have your price increases stick and, at the same time, managing retention such, because if retention goes down, then you have more pressure to add more news. So how does that mathematical equation play out during a downturn? Thank you so much and congrats.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Kash. Thank you for the compliment. I actually love the nature of your question. And let me hit on a couple of things. This is why earlier \u2013 or one of the things I talked about is we are such a different company when it comes to the small business platform than we were even 3 years ago. And so to your question of why do we have confidence around our guidance, and I know that it doesn\u2019t go past us that in this environment, we actually raised our long-term expectation. And it\u2019s because of just the \u2013 how mission-critical the platform is but the services that we have. And two examples I would share with you is, when you look at the formula that we\u2019ve shared, which is we\u2019re going to grow customers 10% to 20% and we\u2019re going to grow ARPC 10% to 20%, the two examples I would give is we have a set of offerings on our platform today that we didn\u2019t have before. QuickBooks Advanced, which is going after mid-market, which has much higher ARPC, 4x the use of sort of services, is something that we didn\u2019t have 3 to 4 years ago. And we are just early in our penetration into that TAM. And in fact, we\u2019ve not only seen no slowing but strengthening in this environment because folks want to ensure that they are on our platform to get paid faster to be able to take care of their employees. And so one is, when you look at going up mid-market, when you look at QuickBooks Live, which is really an opportunity for us to lift heads and go after non-consumption, those are offerings we have that we didn\u2019t have before that are actually higher ARPC. That\u2019s one. Two, remember, 4 to 5 years ago, our Payments business was growing 11% because of where we were on innovation in the platform. Now we\u2019re growing north of 30%. And we have about almost $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. We\u2019re growing at that rate, and our penetration is very low. And more and more customers are starting to digitize their form of payments because of the innovation on our platform, and they are already on our platform. So we have \u2013 and those are just two illustrative examples but very real examples of why we\u2019re seeing the strength that we\u2019re seeing here now and the strength and all the indicators that we see in the coming year. And I would just sort of finish with the bank box of 80% our business is subscription business. So it\u2019s highly, highly predictable. And those are the things that give us confidence as we look ahead.\nKash Rangan: Tremendous dissection of what is driving your confidence. Thanks so much and we will not let Microsoft tell us anything about SMB. We will listen to you first. Thank you so much. \nSasan Goodarzi: We are the ones to look for when we talk about SMBs. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just on Credit Karma and now moving Mint into that segment on an official basis. Maybe we just spend a minute talking about sort of the opportunities there in a little more detail. How much can Mint drive engagement in addition to Credit Karma Money? And just over the long-term, how should we be thinking about that combination?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Daniel, thank you for your question. We kicked off a strategy project. It\u2019s been almost probably a year ago to just understand how we can accelerate making ends meet and our vision to truly have a consumer financial platform that can be the self-driving platform for consumers no matter where they are in their life, whether they are students or someone that is later in their life where they have achieved a level of financial freedom and have different sets of needs. And given the work that we did around our vision, we decided to bring Mint and Credit Karma together because in essence, although we have a lot of prime members as part of the Credit Karma base, Mint actually has a number of feature and functionality that the prime members need the most. So that\u2019s number one is bringing some of the features and functionalities together as part of the Credit Karma platform. And over time, that will actually make Credit Karma much more robust to be able to serve all kinds of members no matter what their sort of credit band is. Number two is actually leveraging the scale and the power of the algorithm, the machine learning capabilities, the decision engines that we have in Credit Karma that ultimately deliver north of 35 billion machine learning predictions per day. We can leverage a lot of those capabilities to make Mint a lot better as part of Credit Karma. So, we do expect that this will be accretive in the long-term, delivering benefits to members, and ultimately, truly of achieving our mission and our vision of unlocking smart money decisions for consumers. So, that is our approach and thinking, and we are very excited about it.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks. And then just a second one on Mailchimp, appreciate all the context you provided about the quarter and the trajectory of the business. I guess are there any learnings from the Mailchimp acquisition that you would share that maybe will impact your acquisition philosophy going forward? And just maybe a comment on sort of what the acquisition outlook and playbook is today. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Absolutely. Let me start with the single-biggest thing that we have learned, and we are diagnosing it wouldn\u2019t have changed any of what we have done. We are very, very excited about what we are going to do in executing our vision with Mailchimp and QuickBooks coming together. But it\u2019s having diagnosed upfront some of the product conversion opportunities that we are going after. I would say that\u2019s probably the single-biggest thing that we did not diagnose as well as I would like to see us diagnose. I would also say that\u2019s a \u2013 if you are going to misdiagnose something, that\u2019s an okay one because it\u2019s within your control and you can address it. But I would say that\u2019s probably the biggest one. It has not at all altered the priorities that I mentioned a moment ago. But it is something that we have really gone back, and we are looking as to how we can put that in our playbook to do a better job diagnosing upfront. But in no way, shape or form does it change how we feel about the possibilities ahead, and it has not impacted our timeline at all. The second thing is our M&A playbook has not changed. Our Uber goal is time to market. Our principles around looking at capabilities that could help us accelerate delivering our vision are unchanged. And so I would just \u2013 I would leave it at that. Nothing new to report. It\u2019s unchanged.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question and great quarter. Just wanted to dig into the payment part of the business, I guess that\u2019s one of the underappreciated asset, I would say, Intuit has. You talked about total invoices now growing $2 trillion versus last year, $1.5 trillion. Could you help us understand how you have been gaining share within that business? And also, what are the opportunity you see for Intuit payments to expand beyond QuickBooks like some of the acquired asset? If you could share some of your long-term vision on that, that would be great.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Absolutely. What\u2019s great about your question, Siti, is our Big Bet 4, which is about being the center of small business growth, is really about helping our customers grow their customer base. And it\u2019s actually about cash flow, managing their cash flow. And that\u2019s where the power of Mailchimp and QuickBooks come together. Specifically around the $2 trillion of invoices that we are now managing on our platform and your question about how do we continue to gain share, I will start with just sharing how we have accelerated our growth from the 11% several years ago to the 30% that I mentioned a moment ago from a charge volume perspective, and it\u2019s really just basic innovation. It\u2019s around discoverability. It\u2019s around innovation like instant deposit. It\u2019s around innovation like paid up-front, which really gives you the ability to send an invoice and get paid instantly because of all the data points that we see. And it\u2019s just really making the experience \u2013 auto enabling the experience for payments to always be on versus opting in. Those are illustrative examples of where we have innovated to accelerate the growth in payments. And by the way, I want to be clear, there is so much more yet to do there because \u2013 when you look at the last 5 years to 6 years, our team has spent probably the first half of those 6 years just building the basic platform capabilities to be able to innovate much faster. We have a lot of those capabilities. Now we are able to innovate and deliver faster innovation to our customers. So, that\u2019s one area where we will continue to double down to take more share. But we also have a significant opportunity to digitize all of business-to-business. A big chunk of this $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform is actually business-to-business, where it\u2019s a QuickBooks customer that transacts with another QuickBooks customer. And the opportunity that we have is that at the end of the day, you can look up that small business, send them an invoice. That invoice ends up sitting \u2013 showing up in their books, and they can pay instantly right on our rails. So, that\u2019s an example of the types of things that we are working on in addition to what I have shared a moment ago to really accelerate increasing our penetration and share of this $2 trillion. And I will just end with going back to a couple of questions that I think were asked around what gives us confidence around our small business guidance. And it\u2019s really \u2013 this is one great example of helping customers get paid faster. It\u2019s already happening on our rails. We don\u2019t need to go acquire the customer. These invoices are being managed on our platform. Now the question is how do we help the customer put more money in their pocket faster, and it\u2019s sort of our right to win. And this is a great example of what gives us a lot of confidence as we look ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: That\u2019s great color. And just a quick follow-up to one of your comments on Mailchimp that you are planning to grow up to meet market. Can you help us understand who are the Mailchimp\u2019s strength right now, maybe in the employee segment and where you are targeting, right, that mid-market? And is it also something \u2013 are you trying to expand your features more beyond e-mail marketing when you are trying to go into the mid-market?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Absolutely. I would liken \u2013 since you and many that are listening have followed us for years, I would liken that the Mailchimp journey that we are on, very similar to the QuickBooks journey. Specifically, there is a lot of overlap in the type of customers that we serve. Mailchimp generally has served the smaller small businesses, less than 10 employees. However, it actually has a lot of the capabilities to be able to serve the mid-market customers. And it comes down to adding some features and functionalities, basic things like how you do billing to actually ensure that you have the right inside sales force and customer success agents to be able to serve these mid-market customers. A lot of what we have built and know how to build in mid-market for our QuickBooks Advanced, but we are doing the same thing now with Mailchimp. So, it has a lot of the feature functionalities, but we are building out additional ones. But we are also building out our sales and customer success inside sales and customer success to be able to then serve those customers. And then you put that together with going to market together with QuickBooks, it really sort of brings the power of the benefits that we are able to deliver to customers and makes us far more attractive in the market for those small businesses that we want to serve.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Hey there. Thanks and good afternoon. Appreciate taking the question. The EPS guide for the full year, it\u2019s not the highest, among the highest we have ever seen at 16% growth as a starting point from Intuit. You have had some questions, it\u2019s especially notable given the current environment. I think it\u2019s clear that increasing the target range for small business helps. But is there anything else you would point to? Are there platform advantages you are finding with some of the newer segments, or just anything else you would point us towards that\u2019s helping to unlock the bigger EPS growth algorithm?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Michael. I will just amplify what Michelle shared earlier. We have leverage that is coming from three places that we view as durable. One is on the technology side. And we are actually excited about having there kind of walk of you through our technology stack, our technology vision and how it\u2019s fueling innovation and also how it\u2019s giving us margin leverage at Investor Day. But in that context, that\u2019s one significant lever where we are continuing to build services so we can build them once and use them multiple times across the company. And it\u2019s actually one of the things that is an accelerant to fueling innovation and acquisitions like Mailchimp and Credit Karma. The second is the leverage we get from how we are building out our marketing platform so that our MarTech services can be used across all of the segments across the company. And third is the technology that we are building once and applying to all of our customer success operations, which just recall, is quite large. We have over 700 million interactions with customers. And we shifted the company years ago from every segment builds out their own operations. So, we are building it once, and the segments leverage the same operations across the company and then making sure that we ensure that those services and those platforms are used by not only across the company but our acquisitions like Credit Karma and Mailchimp. So, the leverage is coming from technology across the company, MarTech and customer success operations. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving what we delivered this past year, the guidance that you heard Michelle talk about and the durability that we believe we have looking ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you. Just a quick follow-on, if I may. Some useful commentary around mix throughout the call. With Credit Karma, you are guiding for 10% to 15% growth. It\u2019s below the longer term targets we have seen. But clearly, there was some outside \u2013 outsized growth there over the past year. So, I am wondering if there is any way you can help disaggregate the tough comps versus some of the macro assumptions to frame that guide in relation to the longer term targets we have seen. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure Michael. It is in fact, both. One is we have a big comp 2 years of 37% and then last year, 58% growth. And we have a lot of confidence in our long-term expectations for 20% to 25%. So, that is unchanged. So yes, one element is the tough comp. But really the \u2013 I would say the other element, probably a bigger element, is the current trends that we are seeing that we have really incorporated in our guide. When you look at our verticals around credit cards, personal loans, insurance and then home loans, just \u2013 and then there is the money vertical, almost every vertical has been impacted. And by the way, you can see based on our guide, the resiliency of the platform, other than, of course, the credit card vertical that really has not seen any significant impact. So, that\u2019s the second piece that we have incorporated into our guidance is the, in fact, the macroeconomic environment that we see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Sasan, a number of CEOs have been calling out the shift to services-based economy from a product-based. And I believe, correct me if I am wrong, you have a heavy services base inside the small business. I am curious do you think that\u2019s helping kind of shelter the small business in this environment right now? Is that playing into some of the defensive nature of what you are seeing in the results in small business for your core?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Brent. And I think the short answer is absolutely. And there are two elements. And I will start with just a reminder that when we look at the small business market of sort of zero to 100 employees, about 70% of it is service-based businesses and about 30% is product-based businesses. And our really strength is in the service-based businesses. And I think the second thing I would just say is we are very, very diversified in the service-based businesses that we serve. We are not sort of overly anchored in one vertical or another. And that really helps with the diversification of not only our performance looking backwards, but opportunity as we look ahead.\nBrent Thill: And when you look at Credit Karma in past downturns, can you just give us a compare and contrast? I know you have compared the small business segment to be more SaaS. You have got virtually layered services around. Is there something different that they have done in the business to diversify? Assuming things got a little worse and not saying that\u2019s what you are saying to the guide, but if that was the case, what gives the defensive nature of that business?\nSasan Goodarzi: The single largest, I would say, uniqueness about Credit Karma, aside from you got 100 million customers, incredible trough, high Net Promoter, 14-plus years of behavioral data where we know so much about these customers and know what they need, when they need it and how they need it, putting that to the side as a foundation, which is critically important, it\u2019s Lightbox. With Lightbox, it raises certainty of the experiences that \u2013 and offers that we can deliver members. But in this environment, more importantly, it is quality, which is there is a huge fight to quality by our partners. So, because we now have almost 70% of our credit card and personal loan transactions on Lightbox \u2013 and by the way, growing, that\u2019s 15 points higher than it was last year, and of course, almost non-existent years ago. And I don\u2019t even think Lightbox existed in the last recession. That is the single-biggest thing of where financial institutions have a lot of certainty when their models are part of Lightbox, so they can identify the kind of customer they want, the kind of offers that they want to provide. And of course, we make the perfect amount. So, I would say that is the single biggest thing. And it\u2019s just the scale of the platform. We are a large part of the economy providing a match between what consumers want to the financial products that they have. But I would say Lightbox.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. And I will echo the congrats. Sasan, you have alluded to this a couple of times, but I was wondering if you could just sort of dive into it in a little bit more detail. Just the power of the platform in small business and as we go into a potentially soft economic backdrop, are customers starting to talk to you all about trying to consolidate on to your platform in a bigger way now? You obviously have the ability to help them address both the back office and the front office. And while we are seeing that, I think anecdotally in payments and payroll, I was just kind of curious, given that budgets might come under more scrutiny, are you benefiting from the idea of consolidating towards one platform versus maybe taking a best-of-breed approach? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Kirk. And in fact, this is probably one of the most misunderstood or least understood element of the benefit that our platform provides. And so I will just start with stating something that I mentioned a moment ago because it really plays into your question, and that is we are not a line item on the small businesses budget. We are the platform that fuels their success. We are mission-critical. Without our platform, a small business can\u2019t run their business. And so it\u2019s really important to have that frame of mind as to what\u2019s the role that we play in the lives of small businesses. The second, to go \u2013 to get to your question, is we now have the services that we didn\u2019t have 3 years ago, 5 years ago. And in fact, yes, they are having those conversations with us less from a can I save money, but more from a perspective of I don\u2019t want to deal with all of these different applications where things are sort of disparate and discrete where I can have everything on your platform. If I am using somebody else\u2019s payroll or somebody else\u2019s capital or somebody else\u2019s payments, why not just use all the services on your platform. And frankly, this is an area where our small business team is actually doubling down on looking forward, which is how do we evolve our go-to-market to actually have a conversation with our customers about all the services that they don\u2019t use that they should use where there will be far more efficient, effective and potentially even save some money because we see all their transactions. We can see what they do if they don\u2019t do it on our platform because they have connected their bank accounts and so on. So, we believe this is an opportunity as we look ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have today for questions. And I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Awesome. Well, thank you for the wonderful questions. And we are really looking forward to seeing, hopefully, all of you, at our Investor Day at September 29th. We will, number one, walk through probably the next level of depth around the experiences that we are delivering and why in this environment they matter the most to our customers across all of our five Big Bets. And you will have a great opportunity to not only ask more questions, but connect with my wonderful team that leads a lot of this great work. So, look forward to seeing you then. Until then, be good, stay safe, and we will talk to you all soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your time today and this concludes our conference. We appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, down 6%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year, partially offset by the addition of Mailchimp; GAAP operating loss of $75 million versus operating income of $402 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $433 million versus $715 million last year; GAAP loss per share of $0.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 versus $1.97 last year. You can find our full fiscal 2022 results in our press release and on our fact sheet. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 41% during the quarter and 20% on an organic basis, excluding $265 million in Mailchimp revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 38% and 22% on an organic basis. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 66% in Q4 or 32% excluding Mailchimp and 61% for the full year or 34% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 33%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking grew 116% in fiscal Q4. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 29%. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online Services revenue grew 107%. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 34%. Mailchimp revenue included in Online Services was $265 million. Although we are making progress with this business as we accelerated our year-over-year revenue growth several points in fiscal Q4 versus when we closed the acquisition in fiscal Q2, revenue was slightly below our expectations. During the quarter, we focused on product innovation to improve conversion ahead of peak season, which starts in September, and therefore, pulled back on marketing investments. I am confident that these are the right steps to position us well as we head into Mailchimp peak season. We expect to ramp up marketing in September after these enhancements are complete. We continue to have confidence in our game plan and acceleration priorities for Mailchimp. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in Payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offering. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 193% in fiscal Q4 and 23% on an organic basis excluding MailChimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits in fiscal 2022 driven by price increases and customer growth. Nearly all of our desktop accounting revenue is now subscription-based, similar to our online accounting offerings. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 17% to $475 million in Q4, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. Full year revenue was $1.8 billion. We've had 2 exceptional years for this business, growing 37% in fiscal 2021 and 58% in fiscal 2022 on a pro forma basis, well above our longer-term expectations of 20% to 25%. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards and personal loans. This was partially offset by headwinds in auto insurance and home loans. As Sasan shared earlier, we are seeing increased volatility in personal loans. We continue developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue was $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10%. I'm proud of our execution this season as we grew share and average revenue per return. Turning to the ProConnect Group. We reported $546 million in revenue for fiscal 2022, up 6%. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $508 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion during fiscal 2022. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving the company a total authorization of $3.5 billion to repurchase shares. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable October 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. As a nearly 40-year-old company, we've been through many economic cycles. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The economic environment was a consideration as we look ahead. We have identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios based on where we see opportunities across our platform. Many of these can be pulled in real time should the need arise in areas like marketing spend, travel, hiring and others as we progress through the year in order to maintain earnings power while positioning the company for a stronger future. We have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense in any macro environment. These principles are intended to accelerate our innovation in the future, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from any downturn in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes revenue of $14.5 billion to $14.7 billion, growth of 14% to 16%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 19% to 20% for Small Business and Self-employed, 9% to 10% for the Consumer segment and 10% to 15% for Credit Karma. As a reminder, Credit Karma grew 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year in fiscal 2022, well ahead of our long-term expectation of 20% to 25%. Our overall guidance assumes recent demand trends continue. Our guidance also includes GAAP earnings per share of $6.92 to $7.22, non-GAAP earnings per share of $13.59 to $13.89. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 25% in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes stock-based compensation of $1.8 billion, an increase of 39% over fiscal 2022. Approximately 25% of this total is equity granted as part of the Credit Karma and Mailchimp transactions, and approximately 75% of this total is related to our broad-based equity program designed to attract, retain and incentivize employees. Looking ahead, we expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to flatten over the next few years. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 23% to 25%, GAAP loss per share of $0.43 to $0.37 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.20. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2023 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Going forward, we are bringing Mint and Credit Karma together under a unified personal finance strategy. Starting in fiscal Q1, we will be reporting Mint as part of the Credit Karma segment. This is reflected in the guidance I shared today but is not material to the growth rate. I also want to share an important change regarding our long-term expectations for Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth going forward. In the past, we shared with you our aspiration to achieve Online Ecosystem revenue growth of better than 30% organically over time. We first provided this expectation in fiscal 2017 when our Online Ecosystem revenue was $850 million. It comprised less than one-third of our small business ecosystem, and we were early in our journey building our online presence. Today, the Online Ecosystem is over 5x larger at $4.4 billion, and it comprised more than two-thirds of total small business revenue in fiscal 2022. This, along with the fact that the majority of the business, is now subscription-based given the shift to subscription in desktop. We believe the right measure moving forward is to look at the performance of our overall business rather than just the Online Ecosystem. We now expect total Small Business and Self-Employed long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20%, up from 10% to 15% previously. While the Online Ecosystem will continue to be our growth catalyst, we will no longer provide specific Online Ecosystem goals. With that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. Thanks for your questions. Appreciate it. Yes, we are very happy to see our operating margin guidance for this coming year. It implies margin expansion of 100 basis points versus FY \u201822. And as you know, that aligns to our financial principles to be able to grow revenue double digits and operating income dollars faster than revenue. So we feel really good about that. As we look at where that's really coming from, as we've been continuing to grow more and more as a platform over time, that really does enable us to look across the business and be able to drive efficiencies and effectiveness while driving accelerated revenue growth, which is resulting in our ability to expand margins while being able to continue to invest to really drive the accelerated revenue growth. As to how we think about that, I don't really see anything that really structurally that impacts that over time. We haven't given any longer-term expectations or long-term guidance on what margins might look like in the longer-term, but I don't necessarily see anything really structurally that prevents us \u2013 as we continue to grow as a platform that prevents us from continuing that growth. To the second part of your question as for the levers that we would pull, yes, I mean, there are a number of things that we would pull, which could be OpEx. As I mentioned, there is marketing spend or travel, hiring, other things like that, that we can pull pretty much in \u2013 a lot of those in real time to be able to impact our operating expenses and be able to maintain the margins that we have committed to. So we want to be ready. It's really kind of what we do on a day-to-day basis. We're always looking for opportunities to drive different efficiencies across the business. Hi, Brad. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about being able to raise the long-term expectations for small business from 10% to 15% to 15% to 20%. I just think it goes to show, as Sasan talked about earlier, really the mission-critical nature of the products and the offerings that we have in small business. As we have increased the growth expectations, the growth algorithm overall is really still focused on the same things. It's about driving customers and it's about driving ARPC. Yes, pricing may be part of ARPC, but really, it is about focusing on driving value and how do we continue to provide offerings for customers that may have a higher ARPC, whether it's QBO Advanced, QuickBooks Live, those kinds of products. And we really are focused on pricing for value, so not just continually raising price. But once we're delivering those additional features that are providing additional value to the customers and we're bringing more innovation to the table, then we look at really should we be raising the price. But overall, very excited about the growth we see with small business."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter, ending the year with momentum as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to be focused on solving our customers' biggest problems by putting more money in their pocket, eliminating work and saving people time and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make. Full year revenue reached $12.7 billion, up 32%, including the addition of Mailchimp and a full year of Credit Karma. Excluding MailChimp, revenue grew 24%. Total revenue growth was fueled by 38% growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which includes 16 points from Mailchimp. Consumer Group revenue grew 10%, and Credit Karma had an outstanding year with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year. I am very proud of the team's performance, delivering strong growth and strong margins, which very few companies at our scale are able to achieve. I'm optimistic about our strategy and opportunities for growth, especially considering an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. The Intuit platform remains mission-critical for powering our customers' prosperity. I'm pleased we are guiding to another year of strong revenue growth and strong margins in fiscal year 2023. Our global AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize keep the benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. We will share more on our vision and the outcomes we're driving across each of these Big Bets next month at our Investor Day. Now let me turn to a topic that I know is top of mind for many of you, the resiliency of our business and the slowing macroeconomic environment. Our company is in a significantly different position than it was during the last recession more than a decade ago. Our platform and cloud-based offerings have significantly expanded to become the platform of choice for consumers and small businesses. Therefore, Intuit is even more mission-critical for our customers we serve. We have highly predictable reoccurring revenue and much of our business is subscription-based. Additionally, the scale of our platform along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators, such as growth in charge volume, number of hours employees are working and number of workers paid, bank account balances of our small business customers, credit card utilization and delinquency rates for members. This allows us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. Let me share how we think about our business in context of a mild recession. To start, in fiscal year 2022, 51% of our revenue came from the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 35% from our Consumer and ProTax businesses and 14% from Credit Karma. First on tax, our tax businesses are very resilient, and we do not expect a mild recession to have any significant impact. Next, with Small Business and Self-Employed Group, QuickBooks and Mailchimp are mission-critical for our customers whose livelihood depends on our platform. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 80% of the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue was subscription-based. As a reminder, Mailchimp is also primarily subscription-based which adds to the scale of our subscription volume. The approximately 20% is transactional-based and includes revenue from QuickBooks payments, capital and per employee pricing for time tracking and payroll. In a mild recessionary environment, we may see an impact on these transactional businesses. In Q4, we did not see any impact. This demonstrates how mission-critical our platform is, especially in this environment. Finally, turning to Credit Karma. This is the business that could be most impacted by weakening economic environment. As a reminder, this business represents 14% of Intuit's revenue in fiscal year 2022. While we expect member engagement to be strong in any economic environment, our financial institution partners could tighten access to credit. In Q4, we experienced increased volatility in personal loans. Many partners that securitized loans are facing a more challenging funding environment as interest rates rise. For context, personal loans represent just over a third of Credit Karma's revenue in fiscal year 2022. Although several personal loan partners tightened underwriting during the quarter, we were able to offset some of this with volume from other partners. This demonstrates the power of the platform. In credit cards, we have not seen any significant impact. We continue to monitor delinquency rates, which we view as a leading indicator for future credit card origination trends. While delinquency rates have increased slightly, they remain near historical lows. We expect credit cards to be less negatively impacted by a mild recession than personal loans. In the mild recession of \u201801-02, credit card originations declined only a few points. And for context, credit cards represent nearly half of credit card revenue in fiscal year 2022. We do expect Lightbox to continue to be a differentiator for Credit Karma as this technology allows lenders to deploy their targeting models in an encrypted environment and leverage thousands of anonymized financial attributes related to Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. This provides more certainty to members and partners on the platform as recommendations are personalized. Currently, no one else can replicate this. Partners usage of Lightbox at the end of fiscal year 2022 was at an all-time high, representing nearly 70% of credit card and personal loan transactions on a combined basis. This was up nearly 15 points from the prior year. We expect Lightbox to help make Credit Karma's business more resilient in a recessionary environment. Now with that as context, the guidance we are providing today assumes current demand trends continue. Wrapping up, we feel more confident than ever in our long-term business strategy. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important and mission-critical than ever. As part of our 3 and 1-year plan that the Board just approved, we are investing heavily in innovation within each of our Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers while delivering top line growth and margin expansion given the strength of our operational playbook. Combined with our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, Intuit remains in a position of strength. We're proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Michelle, thank you. As you have now heard from Michelle and I we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We have a large TAM, secular shifts working in our favor and a highly predictable set of revenue streams. Our innovation is unlocking new opportunities for our platform and delivering truly game-changing benefits for our customers. Intuit remains a best place to work around the world, and I'm proud of the team and what we've accomplished this year. Now let me turn it over to you for any questions that you may have. Yes. Brad, how are you? I'll take that question. First and foremost, I would share with you that we are the ones that pulled back that resulted in the performance that we just shared. So the great news is it's in our control. The second point I would make is the biggest thing that's been reaffirmed as we've been \u2013 become one family with Mailchimp is two of the biggest problems that matters most to our customers and especially, by the way, in tougher times is being able to grow their customer base and being able to manage their cash flow. And the biggest insight that we learned as we started accelerating our marketing spend, which we had shared with all of you that we would do, is that there are conversion on gaps in the product that we felt like were critical to address and not just spend the marketing dollars without the benefit of improved conversion. And specifically, those were things like coming to the website and the number of people that we saw falling off versus what we would expect based on our experience with across the QuickBooks platform, across the Credit Karma platform, the TurboTax platform, what we believe are some best-in-class engagement and conversion. Then when you get into the product, we measure active use and making sure that you're getting into the features that you really wanted to get into and hence why you signed up for Mailchimp and even our checkout process. So those are just three illustrative examples of what I would say just basic blocking and tackling product conversion that we really wanted to double down on to make sure that we are ready for busy season. That did not take away from the priorities that we have shared about Mailchimp, which is one is to create one growth platform with QuickBooks, which we are on track to do. Two, it's a double down on international. In fact, it is now part of our refreshed international strategy to double down on helping customers grow customers with Mailchimp. And then the third is to actually go into mid-market. So what we just announced in terms of our results actually has nothing to do with the environment. It has everything to do with what's in our control and decisions that we made very explicitly to be ready for busy season. And these are playbooks that we know how to execute when it comes to product conversion. Yes. One other thing that \u2013 just amplifying what Michelle just shared, and that is our reliance on price has not changed, meaning that we have an algorithm whereby price is just an element of our overall performance. And we're not relying more on price looking ahead than we did looking backwards. So just reiterating one point that Michelle made just a moment ago? Sure, Alex. Appreciate the question. I'll say a couple of things. First of all, our approach to how we run the company and our approach to guidance and how we factor things in has not at all changed. So just know that our approach is consistent with the way Intuit has always set expectations and set guidance, which is really to deliver on our commitment. That's the number one. Number two, what really informed our perspective as we look ahead is all of the indicators that we see that are forward-looking. But let me just \u2013 if I could double-click in, in a few of the areas. I'll start with tax to put that out of the way, which is no matter the environment, we're not going to expect nor have we seen in our history really any material impact in tax. That's 35% of the company. When you look at the other 51% of the company, which is small business, it's important to note that we are a very different company today than we were 3 years ago, much less 5 years ago, where small businesses are relying on our platform to run their businesses, actually their livelihood. And 80% of our revenue is subscription. And the 20% of that is transactional-based. We take the current environment and how things could play out into account as we set guidance. And the third, which is Credit Karma and 14% of the overall company revenue, we have taken the current environment and what we assume will take place into account. And most of our verticals other than Credit Karma, in fact, have seen an impact, and we have included that in our guidance. So really, that was a long way of saying we are fairly consistent across all of our segments. And we feel very good about the indicators that we see, how we view things will play out and how that informed our guidance moving forward. Yes. Alex, I would say nothing more than what we've experienced in the last couple of years. That's really the short answer. When you look at the last 2 to 3 years, environmentally, it has had probably more of an impact in the tax business than we've seen in years. And as you know, I've been with the company for 17 years plus, ran the tax business for 3 years. And what happened when we hit COVID, the implication on consumers, the extend the tax season, the child tax credit, there are so many things that played into the tax season in the last several years. And as we look at the year ahead, frankly, we view a much more simplified approach to the tax season. Although some of the tax laws will impact what we need to do in the product, that's what we're great at. That's what we know how to do well. So we actually see more normality as we look ahead than we experienced in the last 2 to 3 years. Thank you, Alex. Yes. Sure, Kash. Thank you for the compliment. I actually love the nature of your question. And let me hit on a couple of things. This is why earlier \u2013 or one of the things I talked about is we are such a different company when it comes to the small business platform than we were even 3 years ago. And so to your question of why do we have confidence around our guidance, and I know that it doesn't go past us that in this environment, we actually raised our long-term expectation. And it's because of just the \u2013 how mission-critical the platform is but the services that we have. And two examples I would share with you is, when you look at the formula that we've shared, which is we're going to grow customers 10% to 20% and we're going to grow ARPC 10% to 20%, the two examples I would give is we have a set of offerings on our platform today that we didn't have before. QuickBooks Advanced, which is going after mid-market, which has much higher ARPC, 4x the use of sort of services, is something that we didn't have 3 to 4 years ago. And we are just early in our penetration into that TAM. And in fact, we've not only seen no slowing but strengthening in this environment because folks want to ensure that they are on our platform to get paid faster to be able to take care of their employees. And so one is, when you look at going up mid-market, when you look at QuickBooks Live, which is really an opportunity for us to lift heads and go after non-consumption, those are offerings we have that we didn't have before that are actually higher ARPC. That's one. Two, remember, 4 to 5 years ago, our Payments business was growing 11% because of where we were on innovation in the platform. Now we're growing north of 30%. And we have about almost $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. We're growing at that rate, and our penetration is very low. And more and more customers are starting to digitize their form of payments because of the innovation on our platform, and they are already on our platform. So we have \u2013 and those are just two illustrative examples but very real examples of why we're seeing the strength that we're seeing here now and the strength and all the indicators that we see in the coming year. And I would just sort of finish with the bank box of 80% our business is subscription business. So it's highly, highly predictable. And those are the things that give us confidence as we look ahead. We are the ones to look for when we talk about SMBs. Thank you. Yes. Daniel, thank you for your question. We kicked off a strategy project. It's been almost probably a year ago to just understand how we can accelerate making ends meet and our vision to truly have a consumer financial platform that can be the self-driving platform for consumers no matter where they are in their life, whether they are students or someone that is later in their life where they have achieved a level of financial freedom and have different sets of needs. And given the work that we did around our vision, we decided to bring Mint and Credit Karma together because in essence, although we have a lot of prime members as part of the Credit Karma base, Mint actually has a number of feature and functionality that the prime members need the most. So that's number one is bringing some of the features and functionalities together as part of the Credit Karma platform. And over time, that will actually make Credit Karma much more robust to be able to serve all kinds of members no matter what their sort of credit band is. Number two is actually leveraging the scale and the power of the algorithm, the machine learning capabilities, the decision engines that we have in Credit Karma that ultimately deliver north of 35 billion machine learning predictions per day. We can leverage a lot of those capabilities to make Mint a lot better as part of Credit Karma. So, we do expect that this will be accretive in the long-term, delivering benefits to members, and ultimately, truly of achieving our mission and our vision of unlocking smart money decisions for consumers. So, that is our approach and thinking, and we are very excited about it. Sure. Absolutely. Let me start with the single-biggest thing that we have learned, and we are diagnosing it wouldn't have changed any of what we have done. We are very, very excited about what we are going to do in executing our vision with Mailchimp and QuickBooks coming together. But it's having diagnosed upfront some of the product conversion opportunities that we are going after. I would say that's probably the single-biggest thing that we did not diagnose as well as I would like to see us diagnose. I would also say that's a \u2013 if you are going to misdiagnose something, that's an okay one because it's within your control and you can address it. But I would say that's probably the biggest one. It has not at all altered the priorities that I mentioned a moment ago. But it is something that we have really gone back, and we are looking as to how we can put that in our playbook to do a better job diagnosing upfront. But in no way, shape or form does it change how we feel about the possibilities ahead, and it has not impacted our timeline at all. The second thing is our M&A playbook has not changed. Our Uber goal is time to market. Our principles around looking at capabilities that could help us accelerate delivering our vision are unchanged. And so I would just \u2013 I would leave it at that. Nothing new to report. It's unchanged. Very welcome. Sure. Absolutely. What's great about your question, Siti, is our Big Bet 4, which is about being the center of small business growth, is really about helping our customers grow their customer base. And it's actually about cash flow, managing their cash flow. And that's where the power of Mailchimp and QuickBooks come together. Specifically around the $2 trillion of invoices that we are now managing on our platform and your question about how do we continue to gain share, I will start with just sharing how we have accelerated our growth from the 11% several years ago to the 30% that I mentioned a moment ago from a charge volume perspective, and it's really just basic innovation. It's around discoverability. It's around innovation like instant deposit. It's around innovation like paid up-front, which really gives you the ability to send an invoice and get paid instantly because of all the data points that we see. And it's just really making the experience \u2013 auto enabling the experience for payments to always be on versus opting in. Those are illustrative examples of where we have innovated to accelerate the growth in payments. And by the way, I want to be clear, there is so much more yet to do there because \u2013 when you look at the last 5 years to 6 years, our team has spent probably the first half of those 6 years just building the basic platform capabilities to be able to innovate much faster. We have a lot of those capabilities. Now we are able to innovate and deliver faster innovation to our customers. So, that's one area where we will continue to double down to take more share. But we also have a significant opportunity to digitize all of business-to-business. A big chunk of this $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform is actually business-to-business, where it's a QuickBooks customer that transacts with another QuickBooks customer. And the opportunity that we have is that at the end of the day, you can look up that small business, send them an invoice. That invoice ends up sitting \u2013 showing up in their books, and they can pay instantly right on our rails. So, that's an example of the types of things that we are working on in addition to what I have shared a moment ago to really accelerate increasing our penetration and share of this $2 trillion. And I will just end with going back to a couple of questions that I think were asked around what gives us confidence around our small business guidance. And it's really \u2013 this is one great example of helping customers get paid faster. It's already happening on our rails. We don't need to go acquire the customer. These invoices are being managed on our platform. Now the question is how do we help the customer put more money in their pocket faster, and it's sort of our right to win. And this is a great example of what gives us a lot of confidence as we look ahead. Yes. Absolutely. I would liken \u2013 since you and many that are listening have followed us for years, I would liken that the Mailchimp journey that we are on, very similar to the QuickBooks journey. Specifically, there is a lot of overlap in the type of customers that we serve. Mailchimp generally has served the smaller small businesses, less than 10 employees. However, it actually has a lot of the capabilities to be able to serve the mid-market customers. And it comes down to adding some features and functionalities, basic things like how you do billing to actually ensure that you have the right inside sales force and customer success agents to be able to serve these mid-market customers. A lot of what we have built and know how to build in mid-market for our QuickBooks Advanced, but we are doing the same thing now with Mailchimp. So, it has a lot of the feature functionalities, but we are building out additional ones. But we are also building out our sales and customer success inside sales and customer success to be able to then serve those customers. And then you put that together with going to market together with QuickBooks, it really sort of brings the power of the benefits that we are able to deliver to customers and makes us far more attractive in the market for those small businesses that we want to serve. Yes. Sure, Michael. I will just amplify what Michelle shared earlier. We have leverage that is coming from three places that we view as durable. One is on the technology side. And we are actually excited about having there kind of walk of you through our technology stack, our technology vision and how it's fueling innovation and also how it's giving us margin leverage at Investor Day. But in that context, that's one significant lever where we are continuing to build services so we can build them once and use them multiple times across the company. And it's actually one of the things that is an accelerant to fueling innovation and acquisitions like Mailchimp and Credit Karma. The second is the leverage we get from how we are building out our marketing platform so that our MarTech services can be used across all of the segments across the company. And third is the technology that we are building once and applying to all of our customer success operations, which just recall, is quite large. We have over 700 million interactions with customers. And we shifted the company years ago from every segment builds out their own operations. So, we are building it once, and the segments leverage the same operations across the company and then making sure that we ensure that those services and those platforms are used by not only across the company but our acquisitions like Credit Karma and Mailchimp. So, the leverage is coming from technology across the company, MarTech and customer success operations. And that's what's driving what we delivered this past year, the guidance that you heard Michelle talk about and the durability that we believe we have looking ahead. Yes. Sure Michael. It is in fact, both. One is we have a big comp 2 years of 37% and then last year, 58% growth. And we have a lot of confidence in our long-term expectations for 20% to 25%. So, that is unchanged. So yes, one element is the tough comp. But really the \u2013 I would say the other element, probably a bigger element, is the current trends that we are seeing that we have really incorporated in our guide. When you look at our verticals around credit cards, personal loans, insurance and then home loans, just \u2013 and then there is the money vertical, almost every vertical has been impacted. And by the way, you can see based on our guide, the resiliency of the platform, other than, of course, the credit card vertical that really has not seen any significant impact. So, that's the second piece that we have incorporated into our guidance is the, in fact, the macroeconomic environment that we see. Yes. It's a great question, Brent. And I think the short answer is absolutely. And there are two elements. And I will start with just a reminder that when we look at the small business market of sort of zero to 100 employees, about 70% of it is service-based businesses and about 30% is product-based businesses. And our really strength is in the service-based businesses. And I think the second thing I would just say is we are very, very diversified in the service-based businesses that we serve. We are not sort of overly anchored in one vertical or another. And that really helps with the diversification of not only our performance looking backwards, but opportunity as we look ahead. The single largest, I would say, uniqueness about Credit Karma, aside from you got 100 million customers, incredible trough, high Net Promoter, 14-plus years of behavioral data where we know so much about these customers and know what they need, when they need it and how they need it, putting that to the side as a foundation, which is critically important, it's Lightbox. With Lightbox, it raises certainty of the experiences that \u2013 and offers that we can deliver members. But in this environment, more importantly, it is quality, which is there is a huge fight to quality by our partners. So, because we now have almost 70% of our credit card and personal loan transactions on Lightbox \u2013 and by the way, growing, that's 15 points higher than it was last year, and of course, almost non-existent years ago. And I don't even think Lightbox existed in the last recession. That is the single-biggest thing of where financial institutions have a lot of certainty when their models are part of Lightbox, so they can identify the kind of customer they want, the kind of offers that they want to provide. And of course, we make the perfect amount. So, I would say that is the single biggest thing. And it's just the scale of the platform. We are a large part of the economy providing a match between what consumers want to the financial products that they have. But I would say Lightbox. Yes. Sure, Kirk. And in fact, this is probably one of the most misunderstood or least understood element of the benefit that our platform provides. And so I will just start with stating something that I mentioned a moment ago because it really plays into your question, and that is we are not a line item on the small businesses budget. We are the platform that fuels their success. We are mission-critical. Without our platform, a small business can't run their business. And so it's really important to have that frame of mind as to what's the role that we play in the lives of small businesses. The second, to go \u2013 to get to your question, is we now have the services that we didn't have 3 years ago, 5 years ago. And in fact, yes, they are having those conversations with us less from a can I save money, but more from a perspective of I don't want to deal with all of these different applications where things are sort of disparate and discrete where I can have everything on your platform. If I am using somebody else's payroll or somebody else's capital or somebody else's payments, why not just use all the services on your platform. And frankly, this is an area where our small business team is actually doubling down on looking forward, which is how do we evolve our go-to-market to actually have a conversation with our customers about all the services that they don't use that they should use where there will be far more efficient, effective and potentially even save some money because we see all their transactions. We can see what they do if they don't do it on our platform because they have connected their bank accounts and so on. So, we believe this is an opportunity as we look ahead. Awesome. Well, thank you for the wonderful questions. And we are really looking forward to seeing, hopefully, all of you, at our Investor Day at September 29th. We will, number one, walk through probably the next level of depth around the experiences that we are delivering and why in this environment they matter the most to our customers across all of our five Big Bets. And you will have a great opportunity to not only ask more questions, but connect with my wonderful team that leads a lot of this great work. So, look forward to seeing you then. Until then, be good, stay safe, and we will talk to you all soon. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am proud of our continued momentum as we execute on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include shifts to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team\u2019s execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance. Third quarter revenue grew 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp. It was another strong quarter for our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with revenue up 42%, 20% organically. Credit Karma posted another quarter with revenue at an all-time high, up 48%. And I am proud of how the team executed in the Consumer Group in another unusual tax season. We are confident in our business trajectory and are raising our total Intuit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022. We expect to grow total company revenue 31% to 32% as our platform is in demand now more than ever. Let me now turn to tax. Our multiyear strategy is to extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live. This strategy is working. This fiscal year, we expect our share of total IRS returns to be up approximately 1 point and our share of the do-it-yourself category to increase 2 points. We\u2019re also growing average revenue per return once again. We expect customers in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx, self-employed and investors to grow double-digits in total. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We anticipate achieving a significant milestone with TurboTax Live revenue reaching $1 billion in fiscal year 2022, growing approximately 30% and customers growing 20%. Note that last year, TurboTax Live customer growth significantly benefited from the introduction of the free basic offer. We are proud of the progress against our strategy. However, slower total IRS returns growth is resulting in expected Consumer Group revenue growth of 10% this fiscal year. We now expect overall IRS returns to decline 3% through July 31 compared to IRS returns growth of 3% to 4% the last 2 seasons. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season and overall IRS extensions up significantly year-over-year, with the number of TurboTax customers filing extensions nearly doubling. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. We now expect the do-it-yourself category share of total IRS returns to be flat this year below our expectations after growing an average of approximately 1 point per year over the last 2 years. Our hypothesis is that the do-it-yourself category performance was weaker than we expected due to the onetime stimulus filers, approximately 30% of whom were paid customers for us last season. While the last 3 years were anything but normal, over the period, IRS returns grew on average 1 percentage per year and the do-it-yourself category gained an average of just over 0.5 point of share per year consistent with long-term trends. Looking ahead, we expect more normal total IRS returns growth. More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, continue \u2013 connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I\u2019d like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We continue to see strong momentum with Credit Karma, a data platform where powerful network effects solving a two-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and connect them to insights and advice. In Credit Karma, we continue to innovate across all verticals, all proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty to members and partners on the platform. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans with combined Lightbox penetration remaining very high. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate of members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners. We continue to make progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of both TurboTax and Credit Karma. We integrated Credit Karma Money into TurboTax Live experience, more than tripling the number of TurboTax online customers who deposited their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. This gave them the ability to receive the refund up to 5 days earlier with direct deposits. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and like other Credit Karma members, get access to personalized products across the platform which accelerates engagement over time. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we offer a single place where small businesses can get paid, pay others, manage money and access capital. We are seeing more customers accessing loans through QuickBooks Capital, with loan volume at record level, more than tripling year-over-year in April. We have increased discoverability and expanded eligibility in the product. This is driven by our rich data and proprietary risk models, which allows us to use our customers\u2019 data on their behalf and with their permission to offer access to loans. In addition to cash flow, getting and engaging customers, remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. We continue moving with speed as we focus on product innovation, marketing and improving conversion. First, we launched a customer\u2019s and lead tab within QuickBooks Online, which allows new and existing customers to send revenue and customer data from QBO to MailChimp in real time, where small businesses can segment customers and automate marketing campaigns based on QuickBooks data. We\u2019re also saving customers time by bringing in their contact list into Mailchimp from other partners and platforms. Second, we continue to invest in marketing. We are seeing early signs that the recent investments in paid media are driving growth in customer sign-ups across large markets like the U.S. We expect this to take time for it to translate into financial results, but we\u2019re excited about the potential. And third, we are focused on opportunities to improve conversion as we look at top of the funnel traffic to how we deliver benefits in the product for our customers. This includes highlighting product benefits as soon as customers enter the product, improving the checkout page experience and streamlining in-product navigation. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. During the quarter, we launched in Canada, the first market outside of the U.S., expanding the geographic reach of this offering. Accelerating innovation and executing our strategy starts with our employees. I\u2019m proud to share that we were Fortune\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For list for the 21st year in a row, this year, proudly ranking #11. We remain focused on creating an environment where our employees can bring their whole selves to work and do the best work of their lives, which is reflected in our employee retention rate that is above our peers. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy. Our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and the demand for our platform continues to put Intuit in a position of strength. In the current macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important than ever. We are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp, GAAP operating income of $2.4 billion versus $1.9 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.9 billion versus $2.2 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.28 versus $5.30 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.65 versus $6.07 last year. On May 4, we entered into a settlement agreement with the State Attorneys General regarding our advertising practices related to free tax preparation. This resulted in a $141 million onetime charge in our fiscal third quarter. Under the terms of the settlement, we admitted no wrongdoing. We are pleased to put this issue behind us so we can continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers. Excluding the settlement charge, our fiscal third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher, and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $3.2 billion, up 32%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year. I\u2019m proud of our execution this season as we expect to gain share and grow our average revenue per return. There are four primary drivers of our consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2022 versus the prior year through July 31, 2021. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We now expect total returns to decline 3% this year, below our original expectations. Every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be flat by the end of the year, also below our expectations. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to expand approximately 1 point this year, and our share of the DIY category to be up 2 points excluding users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase this year, driven by a mix shift to TurboTax Live and our premier offering used by investors as well as fewer free customers. As a result of the weaker IRS returns, we now expect total customer growth of 1%, including TurboTax Online paying customer growth of 8% this year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing in our commercial-free offering to decline 11% this year to just over 13 million from over 14 million last year. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season, approximately 30% of whom we\u2019re paying customers. We now expect Consumer Group revenue growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2022 versus our prior guidance of 10% to 11%, reflecting the decline of total IRS returns I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 10% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 4% to 5%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 42% during the quarter or 20% on an organic basis, excluding $257 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 67% or 31% excluding MailChimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 121% in fiscal Q3. Excluding MailChimp, online services revenue grew 28%. MailChimp revenue recorded in online services was $257 million in the quarter, and this was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 221% in fiscal Q3 on a constant currency basis and 29% on an organic basis, excluding MailChimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-teens, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. Longer term, we don\u2019t expect the desktop business to be a growth driver for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue grew 48% to $468 million in Q3, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by personal loans and credit cards and to a lesser extent, auto loans. We are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. As Sasan shared earlier, we saw a more than tripling in the number of TurboTax Online customers who deposit their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we have shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $489 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable July 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to reflect the momentum we\u2019ve seen throughout the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma. Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.623 billion to $12.674 billion, growth of 31% to 32% and including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma, up from prior guidance of 26% to 28% growth. Excluding $765 million to $770 million in Mailchimp revenue, growth of 23% to 24%, up from prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth; GAAP earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.01, down from prior guidance of $7 to $7.17 \u2013 excuse me, $7.16. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% this year, up from 18% previously, non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.68 to $11.74, up from prior guidance of $11.48 to $11.64. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes the impact of the $141 million onetime charge related to the State Attorneys General settlement. Excluding this charge, our expected GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would be approximately 110 basis points higher in fiscal 2022, above our prior guidance. Expected fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would be approximately $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 includes a revenue decline of 8% to 9%, reflecting the earlier tax filing deadline this year versus last year, GAAP loss per share of $0.53 to $0.47 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $1. You can find our full Q4 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. And before closing, I wanted to mention the leadership changes in our Consumer Group that we shared in our earnings release today. Effective May 31, Greg Johnson, General Manager of the Consumer Group, will step down as the leader of Intuit\u2019s Consumer business to become CEO of McAfee. Varun Krishna, Senior Vice President and General Manager of TurboTax Growth Products, will succeed Greg as the General Manager of the Consumer Group. Greg has done a tremendous job driving growth for our Consumer business, and I couldn\u2019t be happier for this next chapter for him. Intuit is well known for developing world-class leaders and Greg is no exception. McAfee is lucky to have him. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome Varun as the Consumer Group\u2019s next General Manager. With over 7 years of experience leading commercial and product innovation for TurboTax, Varun is perfectly suited for leading Consumer Group\u2019s next phase of growth. We are seeing continued momentum across the entire company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I\u2019m proud of the team and how we\u2019ve delivered for our customers so far this year. And with that, let\u2019s now \u2013 go now to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s very impressive to see strong momentum in Credit Karma as well as small business and how you raise the guidance. So Sasan, I\u2019m wondering given this geopolitical uncertainty and even some concern about any macro slowdown, how is Credit Karma positioned in terms of growth and also in your small business segment?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I\u2019ll break down your question sort of in three parts, given that we are a platform company with sort of a great profile of businesses. I\u2019ll start with tax. I know that was not part of your question, but it\u2019s important to start there, which is tax is sort of very resilient in any type of an environment, and it\u2019s more than 30% of the company\u2019s revenue when you look at both TurboTax and our ProTax business. In small business, there is a flight to digitization to manage your cash flow. And just I would remind us that we are now fundamentally a growth and money center platform for small businesses. And so there is a flight to be able to manage your cash flow on our platform. And the two stats that I would use that are very recent and sort of the here and now, one, our loan business had a record high volume in April. It was 3x higher than it\u2019s been year-over-year. And our charge volume continues to be strong. As of last month and even in this last week, our charge volume has been growing north of 30%. And I use those a couple of stats just more as proof points in terms of the importance of our platform in these unique times. And when it comes to Credit Karma, first of all, on the demand side, I would say that when you get into tougher recessionary times, the demand for the products on our Credit Karma platform actually grows. Now it\u2019s \u2013 the discussion is about the supply side. And in fact, with our partners, there is a flight to quality. This is where the power of the data that we have on our customers\u2019 behalf and Lightbox that I\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of years come into play because with our partners and the flight to quality putting their Credit Karma models on our platform, they are actually able to really get the kind of quality customers that they need. And so it\u2019s just sort of a perfect match between members and partners, which is, by the way, why we saw the strength this past quarter of 48% growth and why the platform continues to be very resilient in these times. So those would be, I would say, the headlines I would share with you about our platform being in need at probably some very unique times where our customers need us most.\nSiti Panigrahi: Sasan, thanks for covering the tax, but just a quick follow-up on TurboTax Live Full Service. This is the second year. What sort of trend you have seen? Do you see more share gain from the assisted category or your own customer now moving more into full service kind of product?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, great question. I would just start with \u2013 there is 86 million customers that are in the assisted category and the TAM is over at $20 billion, and we hit a major milestone this year of delivering $1 billion of revenue with TurboTax Live growing at 30%. So we are in the very early stages of what\u2019s possible in growth and penetration in the assisted category. That is really the long-term really bright spot and future growth for TurboTax, which we are very excited about.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] calling in for Kirk. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe one for Michelle. Given some of the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, is there anything that you changed in terms of the forecasting process just to account for some greater uncertainty moving forward? Thank you.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hi, thanks for the question. Yes, as we see the macro environment unfolding, one of the good things that Sasan has shared is we really don\u2019t see a lot of \u2013 have not seen a lot of impact to our business. It is one of the things that we are continuing to look for. But given the way our business works, the platform that we have, and really the need that small businesses and consumers have in times like these, even more for our products and our platform, we don\u2019t anticipate seeing an impact. And so we\u2019re always looking and to make sure to see what\u2019s happening, but we haven\u2019t really changed anything with our forecast at this point in time in any \u2013 as you can see with our guidance that we\u2019ve given.\nSasan Goodarzi: And the only thing I would add is majority of our business, if not most of it, is highly predictable and for the most part, in some areas, it\u2019s subscription, pretty much most of small business, which includes Mailchimp\u2019s subscription. So the predictability is quite high, and we are very sort of data-driven in terms of what we look at daily to see our performance. And as Michelle said, that, combined with the indicators that we see, the demand remains very strong on our platform.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you both.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. Maybe \u2013 sorry, that was a question for Michelle. Just a point of clarification. So am I reading this right that we should add that \u2013 or not add, but like the $0.38 is not included in your guide for the full year. So if it wasn\u2019t for that settlement, the EPS guide would be like $12.06 to $12.12? Is that the right way to read it?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: That\u2019s exactly right, Keith. Because of the nature of the charge, the one-time, it\u2019s not an impact to the underlying structural part of our business. We wanted to make sure that you could see really what is the business driving. And so yes, it actually would have been higher. It would have been the $0.37 higher on GAAP and $0.38 higher on non-GAAP for EPS for the full year.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Got it. That wasn\u2019t my question, it was just a clarification. So the question is pace of operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis? Because it does seem like you\u2019re outperforming your original expectation for FY \u201822. You talked about previously an ability to sort of have a consistent cadence of operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis. I think you talked about maybe like 100 basis points a year going forward. Does that change at all given sort of the outperformance you saw in FY \u201822? Or do you think that\u2019s still achievable on a go-forward basis?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: First of all...\nSasan Goodarzi: Maybe Keith, I\u2019ll get \u2013 I didn\u2019t know it was for Michelle. Michelle, go for it.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: I\u2019m sorry, I thought it was for me.\nSasan Goodarzi: Well, you know how I am. I just jump in. You go.\nKeith Weiss: Margin questions are for Michelle?\nSasan Goodarzi: Alright. Alright. I\u2019ll be quiet.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Except that I lose my voice and can\u2019t talk. But no, you know we have our financial principles, first of all. So our financial principles to grow revenue double digits and grow operating income faster than revenue. We haven\u2019t set out any target for what that margin expansion might look like over time. But we do see that it is possible because of the benefits of being on \u2013 having the platform that we do. And so besides being able to innovate more quickly and deliver for our customers, we do continue to see those opportunities as you\u2019re seeing this year that we can really leverage key services and capabilities across our business whether that be in technology or customer success or sales and marketing, we do continue to see an opportunity there, although we have not given any type of specific range of what that expansion might look like.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Got it. And then for Sasan, I\u2019m hoping to get an update on Mailchimp. It\u2019s \u2013 you saw a nice sequential improvement this quarter, and I think that\u2019s going to surprise a lot of investors. It\u2019s definitely an area where investors have the most degree of caution. And I think somebody that comes from some of the data points that we look at, we look at like Google trends, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be trending higher. I know a lot of my clients look at credit card panel data, and that has been pretty weak. But the performance has been, I think, a little bit better than expectation. Can you give us an update on how Mailchimp is doing and how far into that integration we are?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I\u2019ll tell you, Keith, we are probably more excited today as we sit here than we were even when we made the announcement because now we\u2019re into the work. And I would just say that we are delivering against our expectations and our belief and confidence that is the best is yet to come. And very specifically, we\u2019re focused on creating a growth platform. So in one place, a customer can grow and run their business. And we now have proof points of the things that we\u2019re starting to deliver like the customers and lead tab that\u2019s in QuickBooks, where now we are transferring all of your customer and revenue data into a Mailchimp. The second thing is really looking back the investment in marketing and knowing where to invest has been underwhelming. And that excites us as we look ahead, we\u2019ve got some of our best marketing leadership teams now in Mailchimp and the investments that we are making in terms of one go-to-market strategy, pricing principles and how to invest is that we\u2019re starting to see some green shoots. And with the investments that we\u2019re making, and we\u2019re quite good at these sorts of things. We foresee the financial results will be forthcoming and then last but not least, both going upmarket to mid-market and international. In fact, we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but we have refreshed our international strategy, and a big part of that will actually include Mailchimp because of the fact that half of their business came from outside of the U.S. really with little effort. So that was a long way of saying we\u2019re quite excited about our momentum and we\u2019re very excited about the trajectory of the business and sort of the best in terms of growth is yet to come. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to pick up the performance of Mailchimp through Google Trends.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Very welcome, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Byun: Hi, thank you. This is John Byun on for Brent Thill. Just kind of actually not a macro question, I wonder if you could remind us how you performed in past recessions and how it might be different for you this time. Obviously, you have Mailchimp and you have Credit Karma, but on the plus or minus side. Then I have a follow-up.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, the last recession that we look back on, we actually grew 4%, and this is \u2013 I think this was in 2008, and we grew 4% where most of our peers actually declined. And so we perform well in recessionary times. I would also then go on to say we are a totally different company today than when we were in 2008 in terms of the strength of our platform today versus in 2008. One, we now have a platform and by definition, we\u2019re in the cloud, whereas back then, we\u2019re primarily desktop. We are in the cloud where the tailwinds around digitization, a shift to a virtual world, the shift to online, digitization to drive managing cash flow is actually essential for customers. And then you combine that with what I mentioned earlier with our Credit Karma platform where demand is actually higher in recessionary time. And our strength of our data and Lightbox capability makes them a great flight to quality for our partners, which is the current strength that we are seeing. So we\u2019d actually expect to perform better if it was exactly like-for-like compared to 2008. But nevertheless, those were the stats of the past recession and how we performed and we\u2019re in a much stronger position today.\nJohn Byun: That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And then just another quick one, on Mailchimp, just wanted to see if you could update us on the progress in terms of where the growth is coming from? Is it still mainly from e-mail marketing or are you getting more traction with the broader CRM suite and the side builders in e-commerce?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I would say the majority of really the growth is still coming from just the viral word-of-mouth nature of the platform and we are building out the capabilities of the platform. One of the biggest things that we\u2019ve learned now having the business as part of the company, is how much capabilities the platform has the customers don\u2019t know about and how many customers don\u2019t even know about Mailchimp because we\u2019ve really never invested in marketing. And so a lot of what we\u2019re seeing is sort of just continued word of mouth because of the benefits that it delivers. With our investments in the product that I mentioned a moment ago, the investments that we are making strategically in marketing and that will accelerate over time. And then doing so going upmarket and international, we expect that will be accretive to growth as we head into the future. But most of it right now is just, I would say, word of mouth.\nJohn Byun: Great. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you. This is [indiscernible] for Brad. I guess my first question is, can you compare and contrast any differences in demand you might be seeing between QuickBooks and Mailchimp, if at all? I know in the enterprise category, you kind of see a division of spend between the two, but I was kind of wondering if that\u2019s kind of different with \u2013 given you guys kind of focus around SMB?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. First and foremost, I would start with \u2013 these are both subscription-based businesses and together, they create magic. A part, one helps you manage your cash flow, which is QuickBooks, the other one helps you actually grow your business. And so I would say that the demand and the strength of the demand, it\u2019s fairly consistent for those customers, whether they are new or customers that have been in business for a while that realize that they have to find a way to market to their existing customers, to be able to grow with them and grow their wallet share and also find ways to market their business on different channels, whether it\u2019s their website, whether it\u2019s on Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, Etsy. And so the demand is consistent. It depends on what you\u2019re trying to do. And all businesses are trying to both grow their business and be able to run their business and manage the cash flow. And what they don\u2019t have is the platform in one place nor do they have the data. And that\u2019s why bringing Mailchimp and QuickBooks together will, over time, actually drive higher retention, a higher expansion of services and wallet share and also higher penetration because what we can do together is hard to do a part.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then turning to TurboTax real quick, when I think of some of my favorite differentiators for the product, I think of just auto importing the investments or TT Live and tool service. But it seems like a lot of the R&D work for those are done. So I guess my question is, where are like the incremental investments going in terms of R&D for TurboTax now? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. First of all, there is no destination to the investments. We are continuing to invest in machine learning and knowledge engineering to not only make the experts that are on our platform smarter so that we can lead how we answer questions through technology and not just through human labor. But two, in terms of how we do the matching and how we ensure that our \u2013 really our technology, the bots are engaging and answering the questions. So we\u2019re getting better at this every single day. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that area. I think the other thing I would say is around the money. The biggest thing that we learned this year where we\u2019re excited about next year, it\u2019s actually about everything in the assisted segment is about speed the tax is done and speed to my money. And so the integration of Credit Karma into TurboTax where you can now get early access to your refund, that\u2019s another area of investment for us because there is so much more we can do in the experience. So it\u2019s both getting you to a place where taxes are done and experts are smarter in terms of how they help you and also faster access to money and then being able to do that across very specific segments like investors, self-employed, Latinx and over time, the creator economy. So our investments will continue in those areas. And remember, we invested the platform level and at the company level. These are not just investments within TurboTax, and they also benefit us in QuickBooks Live and other areas.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s awesome color. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. You are very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congratulations, Sasan and team, spectacular results. Sasan, I think some of us, including you, will fondly remember that back in the 2008, 2009 recession, Intuit was probably the only company or one of the few companies that actually grew its revenues right through the recession. Of course, we\u2019re not calling for anything specific here, but as someone running the most admired companies with significant exposure to the SMB space, I\u2019m curious how Intuit\u2019s products are positioned in a way that it could help customers the most to be able to weather through this, ,as we all understand, combination of inflation rates, etcetera. And also, if you could \u2013 I think that\u2019s quite a question. So I\u2019ll just pause with that and hear your thoughts. Thank you once again. Congratulations.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you, Kash, and thank you for the question. I\u2019ll use sort of tangible here and now answer so it doesn\u2019t seem overly generic. I would just start with saying that we are most important in tougher times than just in good times. And I\u2019ll start with small business. There is an accelerated flight to digitization to manage your cash flow as a small business in these tougher times. And we\u2019re seeing that now. And the example I think I used earlier, but is worth bringing up again is in the month of April, our volume of QuickBooks Capital loans was at an all-time high and 3x higher than the same time last year, where times were much, much better compared to what environment all of us see today. And the other is our payments volume. Just in the last month, in the last week, we are growing north of 30%. This is our payments volume. So I use those as tangible examples just to state that we have truly become a growth platform and a money center for small businesses. And in times like this, we are in need, more than ever, because our capabilities are so different than the last time we were in a recession, because we have all the capabilities with Mailchimp and QuickBooks to grow your business and help you with your cash flow. And I will just maybe pause there with small business, and I will remind us that tax, both our ProTax and TurboTax business is more than 30% of the company, and it\u2019s resilient in very tough times because people have to do their taxes. And then last but not least is demand is higher in recessionary times on the Credit Karma platform. And there is actually a flight to quality. And based on our data and Lightbox capability that\u2019s proprietary, more and more partners are wanting to be on Lightbox because they can actually control the quality of their offers, and it makes our platform even more demand, which is what you saw in the last quarter. And so I would foresee that playing forward, which I think was the nature of your question, we are the best positioned to serve consumers and small businesses in tough times and good times.\nKash Rangan: Got it. That\u2019s just to clarify. Small business formation that doesn\u2019t affect Intuit, so you \u2013 they probably lag before you get to the point where they could prefer to buy two products. So, should we be concerned \u2013 how concerned should we rather that small business creation might come to a standstill during the recession, how that might affect Intuit? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned at all. If you look at our history, when the formations were high, when the formations were low or negative, it really \u2013 that\u2019s not the driver of the long-term or short-term health of the business. And so it is not something we worry about. It\u2019s actually not something we track. It\u2019s not something we talk about a lot. And so you all start asking questions, got it. So, I would just say that it is not an area of concern for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel Jester: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On TurboTax Live, just can you help us understand how much of the growth this year was from DIY customers transitioning to TurboTax Live versus how many were kind of net new to the platform this year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for the question. We don\u2019t break out the specifics, but I will take you back to why we love the TurboTax Live platform. One, there is more than 10 million people in the assisted segment that actually a trip and go to another person to help them with assistance within \u2013 and these are directional numbers. Within TurboTax, there is probably more than 10 million people that log in, but never actually finish their taxes. And then there is switching that happens back and forth between doing it yourself and then getting assistance. The reason I bring up those three figures is there is actually a lot of sort of movement in the tens of millions in each category and across the category between do-it-yourself and the systems. And it\u2019s all driven by a lack of confidence. Can I do this myself, did I do it right. And so when we look at the TurboTax Live platform and in fact, I would say TurboTax as a whole, that\u2019s why we are now a platform where you can do it yourself, we can do it with you or we can do it for you across the platform. So, our growth in TurboTax Live comes from all those three areas. They are those that switch from assisted, they are those that would have left DIY that now stay with us and vice versa. It helps us with a funnel metrics. So, that is the driver of where we are in TurboTax Live. That has been the driver looking backwards, and it will continue to be the driver looking ahead.\nDaniel Jester: Great. That\u2019s really helpful context. Thank you. And then just to stick with tax, the comment you made about you had 3x the number of TurboTax users who deposit their refund in a Credit Karma account. I wonder how much of a leading indicator actually is that? Do you track their balances, or is there any color you can share about what that can mean in the future? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. First of all, we are really focused on the money benefit for our customers. And for those that live paycheck to paycheck to get five days early access to their refund is really meaningful. So, I am super proud of our team for what they are doing here and \u2013 because it really changes lives. With that said, we believe our hypothesis is, one, over time, this will actually help with TurboTax retention. These customers become new Credit Karma members. And then as you know, Credit Karma and the Credit Karma platform, we are really good at leveraging what we know about you with your permission to then really match you to financial products that are right for you and find ways to save money and get out of debt. So, it\u2019s new customers on a platform that already has over 120 million members that over time, as we engage them, we will be able to monetize. We do watch their behaviors. Do they keep the money on a Credit Karma Money, do they drain it, what we can help them with in terms of things they can do with that money to be able to build their credit. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 it truly feeds into the network effect of delivering benefits and the customers coming back for more benefits.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nStrecker Backe: Thank you. This is Strecker Backe on for Alex. So, just with the success that you and with seeing with Credit Karma and Mailchimp, has it changed your view on doing additional M&A over the next 12 months to 18 months? And are even making you consider more of these larger transformational deals? So, can you just give us an update on how you are thinking about M&A right now? And would you say that maybe your \u2013 resource-wise, you are very focused on integrating these companies still or you have some room to take on additional deals if it\u2019s the right deal? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thanks for the question. First, I will start by saying our principles around acquisitions have not changed. For us, it is all about time to market and having a platform that can fundamentally power the prosperity of consumers and small businesses that we serve. And secondarily, we expect excellence from ourselves and our teams, and we expect these acquisitions to be building the kind of momentum that we are building, and we are \u2013 we have a set of mechanisms within our Intuit operating system where we monitor very closely our progress against the deliverables, and I mean the product and marketing deliverables and the talent on the team and their engagement to really ensure that things are on track. And really, everything with both of these acquisitions is about acceleration. We only integrate as long as it accelerates. And so we have a very I would say, good playbook in terms of how to make acquisitions. And in both cases, when you look at Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we bought the capabilities and the incredible talent because they do things that we are not great at and there are things we do that they are not great at and together as a family, we can create magic. So, with all of that said, it doesn\u2019t accelerate or decelerate what we are looking at from a time-to-market perspective, they are both on track in terms of our expectations. And we are very discrete in terms of how we allocate mind share and resources to both of these assets. And frankly, the biggest hindrance for future acquisitions is how good their management team is. It is not our mind share or our resources. So, that\u2019s the way we think about it.\nStrecker Backe: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Bob and on for Brad and congrats on a strong tax year despite the IRS headwinds. Just sticking with tax quickly, now that you have had a second year of more basic live SKUs under your belt, how should we think about the rate and pace of customers shifting from maybe a more basic SKU to deluxe premier? And how that compares to the typical trajectory that you might see on the traditional TurboTax Online side of things?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, it\u2019s a really good question. First of all, I would tell you, having sort of experimented with our TurboTax Live basic offer is a good experiment and it worked. The biggest thing that I would tell you that we learned in this \u2013 particularly this last year is what really matters is speed to your taxes done with an expert and speed the money. And that is an area where we are doubling down going into next year because the majority of these customers, they want their taxes done right by an expert or if you do it for them and they want access to their money as soon as possible, both of which we can deliver on. And so really, in that context, folks that use an assisted method generally have more complex situation. And we would expect, over time, the higher SKUs that we have to play a bigger role when it comes to TurboTax Live.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s helpful there. And Sasan, just to the earlier point you made earlier on the call just on international. Have you seen any change in terms of trends of new customer growth or even top of funnel with either QuickBooks and Mailchimp when you look internationally versus maybe more in the U.S.?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. What is consistent is what I have shared before, which is, I would say, U.S. and Canada, and I will just use COVID as an example, coming out of \u2013 we are not out of COVID, but coming out of sort of the world shutting down, bounce back much faster than the other countries that we are in. In the UK, in Australia and France, there has been so many sort of start, stop, start-stop, that it\u2019s impacted the sort of building momentum in that country. And I don\u2019t mean to us, I just mean how consumers and small businesses thinking about managing their financial life. So, they are starting to bounce back, but they, for sure, are tracking behind the U.S. and Canada. And again, I will say that what it really excites us looking ahead is the possibilities to help customers grow their customers in small business with Mailchimp. That will be a bigger part of our future as we roll out our strategy and game plan and we believe that, that will be over the long-term, accretive to our growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks very much and congratulations. Sasan, I want to dig into \u2013 this is kind of an overriding question on the cadence of the tax season, and want to dig into the extension. You mentioned that the IRS has elevated extensions this year and you do as well. Could you just speak a little bit more to that? And address might there be any variability, good or bad, relative to what you are expecting for the volume for the full year just on where your fiscal year ends and potential extension? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Scott. Well, first of all, I will start with the headline, which is there could be. But now let me give you more specifics with the guidance and what we are talking to you about is for our fiscal year, which is through the end of July. And I will start at the top. The IRS returns through July, we are observing that it will be down three points, and it\u2019s driven by stimulus filers that didn\u2019t come back. About 30% of them were actually paying customers and IRS extensions being up. And in our base, they are nearly doubled. And so we have made some assumptions in terms of what will happen through July. And of course, we will talk to you all more as we talk about our guidance for next fiscal year because we have not made those estimates, and we won\u2019t communicate it today because our focus was what we communicate to you through July. But certainly, the extensions, most of those customers at some point come back, and \u2013 but we have not estimated what that will be after July. And we do expect just \u2013 so it said again that IRS total returns will be more normal next year because, in essence, this year, we are digesting what happened in the last 2 years because of all the stimulus filers and we would expect it to be more back to the normal flat or up as we look into the future.\nScott Schneeberger: Yes. Certainly, that would make sense. The \u2013 and just as a follow-up, still in tax. When Michelle has given her part on revenue per return, she called out TurboTax Live in premier. So, in the Latinx self-employed investment category, I assume that\u2019s probably a little bit more weighted that double-digit growth on the premier, the investor category. Just curious, is that so? And also for the Latinx self-employed and investor group, how sustainable is that growth? You have got really nice growth for a few years. Is there a long runway to that? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. For sure. Let me start with the latter part of your question. When we look at the assisted category where there is more than a $20 billion TAM, and by the way, there is another $10 billion TAM, which is business tax that we have not talked about. So, in total, it\u2019s $30 billion. TurboTax Live is $1 billion. And so we have got a lot of runway. And as you have heard me talk in prior years, we are sort of in the early days, and we got a 10-year run here, hopefully, now that we have divulged how big TurboTax Live is, you can see how much runway we have. So, there is a lot of runway there. There is also a lot of runway in our underpenetrated segments. We are truly just getting started with Latinx, self-employed and the investor segment because we are actually under-shared in those segments based on all the data that we see. And so when we look at those segments, which is both do-it-yourself and in the assisted segment, we also have an equal runway. And we believe, down the road, the creator community \u2013 the creator segment will continue to become a larger part of those that choose to do taxes, and that\u2019s an area where we will be focused over time as well. So, that was a long answer to your short question. I think the headline I would leave you with is, yes, there is a runway for sure. And it\u2019s a multiyear runway in all of those areas.\nScott Schneeberger: Okay, great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKartik Mehta: Good evening Sasan. Just going down the tax segment a little bit, I think Michelle said that you expect the DIY segment to be flat. And I am wondering, I know the last few seasons have been a little bit different. And I am wondering as we move forward to next year, what you would expect over the next 2 years, 3 years for the DIY segment growth to be?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thanks for the question. And I will start with the first part of what you led with. When we look at the last 3 years and even more historically, IRS returns has been up about 1% and the DIY category has grown about 0.5 point. And so when you look at the last 3 years with all the anomalies, that also holds true. And the way we keep score is our share of the total IRS returns with respect to just now the platform that we have, where you can do it yourself or we will do it for you on the other spectrum. But specifically to answer your question, we do believe over time that the DIY category will continue to grow just as it has grown historically. So, we do believe that this is just I would say, a year where we are digesting all of the anomalies in the last 2 years.\nKartik Mehta: And this is on Credit Karma, you talked a little bit about how banks will \u2013 or credit card issuers will rely on Credit Karma even more during the recession. And I am wondering if you have seen any signs of banks starting to tighten credit standards and if that is a benefit yet to Credit Karma?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. We have over 120 partners on our platform and these partners, they are big and they are small. And with that as context, are always experimenting and adjusting both in good times and not so good times, their credit cycle and they jump between bands, whether they are more interested in those that have a credit band below 620, which is subprime or between 620 to 700, which is prime or near prime and then, of course, anything over 700, which is prime. And the point is, based on our platform and the demand on our platform and the supply on our platform, we see very good supply across all of the bands because of the focus areas of the partners. And so that drives the strength that we saw this last quarter, and we would expect it going forward in context of our guidance.\nKartik Mehta: Alright. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Sasan, as you work to put together the fiscal \u201823 operating plan in the coming weeks and months, what type of forward indicators are you focused on internally and externally to sort of inform that decision? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Brad, great question because we are actually \u2013 we are done with our 3-year and 1-year plan and the way our cycle works is while we are in the heat of delivering this year, we finish our planning for next year. We look at a few things. One, we look at secular trends. We look at facts and figures on our platform. So, the secular trends are what I have mentioned earlier, which is a shift to using virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omnichannel and an acceleration to using digital money platform. So, we look at secular shifts and we look at the facts and figures around the secular shifts. We then look at all the things that actually happened on our platform and our share. If I just use a couple of examples, we have over $1.5 trillion of invoices that are generated on our small business platform. But as we shared last Investor Day and of course, this number is bigger now, our payments volume was over $90 billion. And so you look at \u2013 that\u2019s a very low share. When you look at our share of the assisted category in tax, very low share, when you look at our share of financial products on Credit Karma, credit cards, personal loans, very low share. So, we look at data around our share and our performance around our share. And then we will also look at economic factors like unemployment, like default rates, like projections around the economy. By the way, we are the best projector of the economy because of the data that we see on our small business platform. So, we look at all of those things. And then the way we put in \u2013 put together our plan is sort of worst case, middle case, best case. And that\u2019s how we manage the company. And by the way, this is something that we are quite good at. And then we manage based on the data that we see, we managed to ensure that we are protecting our long-term investor investments while we deliver for today for our customers. So, that\u2019s a little bit of a snapshot in terms of how we think about it.\nBrad Reback: That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. So, I will. Hey, thank you, everyone, for making the time. Thank you for all your wonderful questions. As I said earlier, I am super proud of our employees across the company and our partners, and it\u2019s a real privilege and honor to be able to serve our members and customers in these unique times. And so all of you be safe, be well, and we will talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp, GAAP operating income of $2.4 billion versus $1.9 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.9 billion versus $2.2 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.28 versus $5.30 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.65 versus $6.07 last year. On May 4, we entered into a settlement agreement with the State Attorneys General regarding our advertising practices related to free tax preparation. This resulted in a $141 million onetime charge in our fiscal third quarter. Under the terms of the settlement, we admitted no wrongdoing. We are pleased to put this issue behind us so we can continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers. Excluding the settlement charge, our fiscal third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher, and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $3.2 billion, up 32%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year. I'm proud of our execution this season as we expect to gain share and grow our average revenue per return. There are four primary drivers of our consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2022 versus the prior year through July 31, 2021. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We now expect total returns to decline 3% this year, below our original expectations. Every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be flat by the end of the year, also below our expectations. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to expand approximately 1 point this year, and our share of the DIY category to be up 2 points excluding users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase this year, driven by a mix shift to TurboTax Live and our premier offering used by investors as well as fewer free customers. As a result of the weaker IRS returns, we now expect total customer growth of 1%, including TurboTax Online paying customer growth of 8% this year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing in our commercial-free offering to decline 11% this year to just over 13 million from over 14 million last year. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season, approximately 30% of whom we're paying customers. We now expect Consumer Group revenue growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2022 versus our prior guidance of 10% to 11%, reflecting the decline of total IRS returns I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 10% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 4% to 5%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 42% during the quarter or 20% on an organic basis, excluding $257 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 67% or 31% excluding MailChimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 121% in fiscal Q3. Excluding MailChimp, online services revenue grew 28%. MailChimp revenue recorded in online services was $257 million in the quarter, and this was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 221% in fiscal Q3 on a constant currency basis and 29% on an organic basis, excluding MailChimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-teens, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. Longer term, we don't expect the desktop business to be a growth driver for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue grew 48% to $468 million in Q3, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by personal loans and credit cards and to a lesser extent, auto loans. We are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. As Sasan shared earlier, we saw a more than tripling in the number of TurboTax Online customers who deposit their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we have shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $489 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable July 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to reflect the momentum we've seen throughout the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma. Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.623 billion to $12.674 billion, growth of 31% to 32% and including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma, up from prior guidance of 26% to 28% growth. Excluding $765 million to $770 million in Mailchimp revenue, growth of 23% to 24%, up from prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth; GAAP earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.01, down from prior guidance of $7 to $7.17 \u2013 excuse me, $7.16. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% this year, up from 18% previously, non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.68 to $11.74, up from prior guidance of $11.48 to $11.64. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes the impact of the $141 million onetime charge related to the State Attorneys General settlement. Excluding this charge, our expected GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would be approximately 110 basis points higher in fiscal 2022, above our prior guidance. Expected fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would be approximately $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 includes a revenue decline of 8% to 9%, reflecting the earlier tax filing deadline this year versus last year, GAAP loss per share of $0.53 to $0.47 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $1. You can find our full Q4 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Hi, thanks for the question. Yes, as we see the macro environment unfolding, one of the good things that Sasan has shared is we really don't see a lot of \u2013 have not seen a lot of impact to our business. It is one of the things that we are continuing to look for. But given the way our business works, the platform that we have, and really the need that small businesses and consumers have in times like these, even more for our products and our platform, we don't anticipate seeing an impact. And so we're always looking and to make sure to see what's happening, but we haven't really changed anything with our forecast at this point in time in any \u2013 as you can see with our guidance that we've given. That's exactly right, Keith. Because of the nature of the charge, the one-time, it's not an impact to the underlying structural part of our business. We wanted to make sure that you could see really what is the business driving. And so yes, it actually would have been higher. It would have been the $0.37 higher on GAAP and $0.38 higher on non-GAAP for EPS for the full year. First of all... I'm sorry, I thought it was for me. Except that I lose my voice and can't talk. But no, you know we have our financial principles, first of all. So our financial principles to grow revenue double digits and grow operating income faster than revenue. We haven't set out any target for what that margin expansion might look like over time. But we do see that it is possible because of the benefits of being on \u2013 having the platform that we do. And so besides being able to innovate more quickly and deliver for our customers, we do continue to see those opportunities as you're seeing this year that we can really leverage key services and capabilities across our business whether that be in technology or customer success or sales and marketing, we do continue to see an opportunity there, although we have not given any type of specific range of what that expansion might look like."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am proud of our continued momentum as we execute on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include shifts to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team's execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance. Third quarter revenue grew 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp. It was another strong quarter for our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with revenue up 42%, 20% organically. Credit Karma posted another quarter with revenue at an all-time high, up 48%. And I am proud of how the team executed in the Consumer Group in another unusual tax season. We are confident in our business trajectory and are raising our total Intuit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022. We expect to grow total company revenue 31% to 32% as our platform is in demand now more than ever. Let me now turn to tax. Our multiyear strategy is to extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live. This strategy is working. This fiscal year, we expect our share of total IRS returns to be up approximately 1 point and our share of the do-it-yourself category to increase 2 points. We're also growing average revenue per return once again. We expect customers in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx, self-employed and investors to grow double-digits in total. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We anticipate achieving a significant milestone with TurboTax Live revenue reaching $1 billion in fiscal year 2022, growing approximately 30% and customers growing 20%. Note that last year, TurboTax Live customer growth significantly benefited from the introduction of the free basic offer. We are proud of the progress against our strategy. However, slower total IRS returns growth is resulting in expected Consumer Group revenue growth of 10% this fiscal year. We now expect overall IRS returns to decline 3% through July 31 compared to IRS returns growth of 3% to 4% the last 2 seasons. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season and overall IRS extensions up significantly year-over-year, with the number of TurboTax customers filing extensions nearly doubling. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. We now expect the do-it-yourself category share of total IRS returns to be flat this year below our expectations after growing an average of approximately 1 point per year over the last 2 years. Our hypothesis is that the do-it-yourself category performance was weaker than we expected due to the onetime stimulus filers, approximately 30% of whom were paid customers for us last season. While the last 3 years were anything but normal, over the period, IRS returns grew on average 1 percentage per year and the do-it-yourself category gained an average of just over 0.5 point of share per year consistent with long-term trends. Looking ahead, we expect more normal total IRS returns growth. More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, continue \u2013 connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We continue to see strong momentum with Credit Karma, a data platform where powerful network effects solving a two-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and connect them to insights and advice. In Credit Karma, we continue to innovate across all verticals, all proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty to members and partners on the platform. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans with combined Lightbox penetration remaining very high. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate of members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners. We continue to make progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of both TurboTax and Credit Karma. We integrated Credit Karma Money into TurboTax Live experience, more than tripling the number of TurboTax online customers who deposited their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. This gave them the ability to receive the refund up to 5 days earlier with direct deposits. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and like other Credit Karma members, get access to personalized products across the platform which accelerates engagement over time. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we offer a single place where small businesses can get paid, pay others, manage money and access capital. We are seeing more customers accessing loans through QuickBooks Capital, with loan volume at record level, more than tripling year-over-year in April. We have increased discoverability and expanded eligibility in the product. This is driven by our rich data and proprietary risk models, which allows us to use our customers' data on their behalf and with their permission to offer access to loans. In addition to cash flow, getting and engaging customers, remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. We continue moving with speed as we focus on product innovation, marketing and improving conversion. First, we launched a customer's and lead tab within QuickBooks Online, which allows new and existing customers to send revenue and customer data from QBO to MailChimp in real time, where small businesses can segment customers and automate marketing campaigns based on QuickBooks data. We're also saving customers time by bringing in their contact list into Mailchimp from other partners and platforms. Second, we continue to invest in marketing. We are seeing early signs that the recent investments in paid media are driving growth in customer sign-ups across large markets like the U.S. We expect this to take time for it to translate into financial results, but we're excited about the potential. And third, we are focused on opportunities to improve conversion as we look at top of the funnel traffic to how we deliver benefits in the product for our customers. This includes highlighting product benefits as soon as customers enter the product, improving the checkout page experience and streamlining in-product navigation. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. During the quarter, we launched in Canada, the first market outside of the U.S., expanding the geographic reach of this offering. Accelerating innovation and executing our strategy starts with our employees. I'm proud to share that we were Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list for the 21st year in a row, this year, proudly ranking #11. We remain focused on creating an environment where our employees can bring their whole selves to work and do the best work of their lives, which is reflected in our employee retention rate that is above our peers. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy. Our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and the demand for our platform continues to put Intuit in a position of strength. In the current macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important than ever. We are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. And before closing, I wanted to mention the leadership changes in our Consumer Group that we shared in our earnings release today. Effective May 31, Greg Johnson, General Manager of the Consumer Group, will step down as the leader of Intuit's Consumer business to become CEO of McAfee. Varun Krishna, Senior Vice President and General Manager of TurboTax Growth Products, will succeed Greg as the General Manager of the Consumer Group. Greg has done a tremendous job driving growth for our Consumer business, and I couldn't be happier for this next chapter for him. Intuit is well known for developing world-class leaders and Greg is no exception. McAfee is lucky to have him. At the same time, I couldn't be more excited to welcome Varun as the Consumer Group's next General Manager. With over 7 years of experience leading commercial and product innovation for TurboTax, Varun is perfectly suited for leading Consumer Group's next phase of growth. We are seeing continued momentum across the entire company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of the team and how we've delivered for our customers so far this year. And with that, let's now \u2013 go now to your questions. Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I'll break down your question sort of in three parts, given that we are a platform company with sort of a great profile of businesses. I'll start with tax. I know that was not part of your question, but it's important to start there, which is tax is sort of very resilient in any type of an environment, and it's more than 30% of the company's revenue when you look at both TurboTax and our ProTax business. In small business, there is a flight to digitization to manage your cash flow. And just I would remind us that we are now fundamentally a growth and money center platform for small businesses. And so there is a flight to be able to manage your cash flow on our platform. And the two stats that I would use that are very recent and sort of the here and now, one, our loan business had a record high volume in April. It was 3x higher than it's been year-over-year. And our charge volume continues to be strong. As of last month and even in this last week, our charge volume has been growing north of 30%. And I use those a couple of stats just more as proof points in terms of the importance of our platform in these unique times. And when it comes to Credit Karma, first of all, on the demand side, I would say that when you get into tougher recessionary times, the demand for the products on our Credit Karma platform actually grows. Now it's \u2013 the discussion is about the supply side. And in fact, with our partners, there is a flight to quality. This is where the power of the data that we have on our customers' behalf and Lightbox that I've been talking about over the last couple of years come into play because with our partners and the flight to quality putting their Credit Karma models on our platform, they are actually able to really get the kind of quality customers that they need. And so it's just sort of a perfect match between members and partners, which is, by the way, why we saw the strength this past quarter of 48% growth and why the platform continues to be very resilient in these times. So those would be, I would say, the headlines I would share with you about our platform being in need at probably some very unique times where our customers need us most. Yes, great question. I would just start with \u2013 there is 86 million customers that are in the assisted category and the TAM is over at $20 billion, and we hit a major milestone this year of delivering $1 billion of revenue with TurboTax Live growing at 30%. So we are in the very early stages of what's possible in growth and penetration in the assisted category. That is really the long-term really bright spot and future growth for TurboTax, which we are very excited about. You are very welcome. And the only thing I would add is majority of our business, if not most of it, is highly predictable and for the most part, in some areas, it's subscription, pretty much most of small business, which includes Mailchimp's subscription. So the predictability is quite high, and we are very sort of data-driven in terms of what we look at daily to see our performance. And as Michelle said, that, combined with the indicators that we see, the demand remains very strong on our platform. Very welcome. Maybe Keith, I'll get \u2013 I didn't know it was for Michelle. Michelle, go for it. Well, you know how I am. I just jump in. You go. Alright. Alright. I'll be quiet. Yes. I'll tell you, Keith, we are probably more excited today as we sit here than we were even when we made the announcement because now we're into the work. And I would just say that we are delivering against our expectations and our belief and confidence that is the best is yet to come. And very specifically, we're focused on creating a growth platform. So in one place, a customer can grow and run their business. And we now have proof points of the things that we're starting to deliver like the customers and lead tab that's in QuickBooks, where now we are transferring all of your customer and revenue data into a Mailchimp. The second thing is really looking back the investment in marketing and knowing where to invest has been underwhelming. And that excites us as we look ahead, we've got some of our best marketing leadership teams now in Mailchimp and the investments that we are making in terms of one go-to-market strategy, pricing principles and how to invest is that we're starting to see some green shoots. And with the investments that we're making, and we're quite good at these sorts of things. We foresee the financial results will be forthcoming and then last but not least, both going upmarket to mid-market and international. In fact, we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but we have refreshed our international strategy, and a big part of that will actually include Mailchimp because of the fact that half of their business came from outside of the U.S. really with little effort. So that was a long way of saying we're quite excited about our momentum and we're very excited about the trajectory of the business and sort of the best in terms of growth is yet to come. And I don't think you're going to be able to pick up the performance of Mailchimp through Google Trends. Yes. Very welcome, Keith. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, the last recession that we look back on, we actually grew 4%, and this is \u2013 I think this was in 2008, and we grew 4% where most of our peers actually declined. And so we perform well in recessionary times. I would also then go on to say we are a totally different company today than when we were in 2008 in terms of the strength of our platform today versus in 2008. One, we now have a platform and by definition, we're in the cloud, whereas back then, we're primarily desktop. We are in the cloud where the tailwinds around digitization, a shift to a virtual world, the shift to online, digitization to drive managing cash flow is actually essential for customers. And then you combine that with what I mentioned earlier with our Credit Karma platform where demand is actually higher in recessionary time. And our strength of our data and Lightbox capability makes them a great flight to quality for our partners, which is the current strength that we are seeing. So we'd actually expect to perform better if it was exactly like-for-like compared to 2008. But nevertheless, those were the stats of the past recession and how we performed and we're in a much stronger position today. Yes. I would say the majority of really the growth is still coming from just the viral word-of-mouth nature of the platform and we are building out the capabilities of the platform. One of the biggest things that we've learned now having the business as part of the company, is how much capabilities the platform has the customers don't know about and how many customers don't even know about Mailchimp because we've really never invested in marketing. And so a lot of what we're seeing is sort of just continued word of mouth because of the benefits that it delivers. With our investments in the product that I mentioned a moment ago, the investments that we are making strategically in marketing and that will accelerate over time. And then doing so going upmarket and international, we expect that will be accretive to growth as we head into the future. But most of it right now is just, I would say, word of mouth. You are very welcome. Sure. First and foremost, I would start with \u2013 these are both subscription-based businesses and together, they create magic. A part, one helps you manage your cash flow, which is QuickBooks, the other one helps you actually grow your business. And so I would say that the demand and the strength of the demand, it's fairly consistent for those customers, whether they are new or customers that have been in business for a while that realize that they have to find a way to market to their existing customers, to be able to grow with them and grow their wallet share and also find ways to market their business on different channels, whether it's their website, whether it's on Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, Etsy. And so the demand is consistent. It depends on what you're trying to do. And all businesses are trying to both grow their business and be able to run their business and manage the cash flow. And what they don't have is the platform in one place nor do they have the data. And that's why bringing Mailchimp and QuickBooks together will, over time, actually drive higher retention, a higher expansion of services and wallet share and also higher penetration because what we can do together is hard to do a part. Sure. First of all, there is no destination to the investments. We are continuing to invest in machine learning and knowledge engineering to not only make the experts that are on our platform smarter so that we can lead how we answer questions through technology and not just through human labor. But two, in terms of how we do the matching and how we ensure that our \u2013 really our technology, the bots are engaging and answering the questions. So we're getting better at this every single day. And we're going to continue to invest in that area. I think the other thing I would say is around the money. The biggest thing that we learned this year where we're excited about next year, it's actually about everything in the assisted segment is about speed the tax is done and speed to my money. And so the integration of Credit Karma into TurboTax where you can now get early access to your refund, that's another area of investment for us because there is so much more we can do in the experience. So it's both getting you to a place where taxes are done and experts are smarter in terms of how they help you and also faster access to money and then being able to do that across very specific segments like investors, self-employed, Latinx and over time, the creator economy. So our investments will continue in those areas. And remember, we invested the platform level and at the company level. These are not just investments within TurboTax, and they also benefit us in QuickBooks Live and other areas. Yes. You are very welcome. Yes. Thank you, Kash, and thank you for the question. I'll use sort of tangible here and now answer so it doesn't seem overly generic. I would just start with saying that we are most important in tougher times than just in good times. And I'll start with small business. There is an accelerated flight to digitization to manage your cash flow as a small business in these tougher times. And we're seeing that now. And the example I think I used earlier, but is worth bringing up again is in the month of April, our volume of QuickBooks Capital loans was at an all-time high and 3x higher than the same time last year, where times were much, much better compared to what environment all of us see today. And the other is our payments volume. Just in the last month, in the last week, we are growing north of 30%. This is our payments volume. So I use those as tangible examples just to state that we have truly become a growth platform and a money center for small businesses. And in times like this, we are in need, more than ever, because our capabilities are so different than the last time we were in a recession, because we have all the capabilities with Mailchimp and QuickBooks to grow your business and help you with your cash flow. And I will just maybe pause there with small business, and I will remind us that tax, both our ProTax and TurboTax business is more than 30% of the company, and it's resilient in very tough times because people have to do their taxes. And then last but not least is demand is higher in recessionary times on the Credit Karma platform. And there is actually a flight to quality. And based on our data and Lightbox capability that's proprietary, more and more partners are wanting to be on Lightbox because they can actually control the quality of their offers, and it makes our platform even more demand, which is what you saw in the last quarter. And so I would foresee that playing forward, which I think was the nature of your question, we are the best positioned to serve consumers and small businesses in tough times and good times. Yes. I wouldn't be concerned at all. If you look at our history, when the formations were high, when the formations were low or negative, it really \u2013 that's not the driver of the long-term or short-term health of the business. And so it is not something we worry about. It's actually not something we track. It's not something we talk about a lot. And so you all start asking questions, got it. So, I would just say that it is not an area of concern for us. Yes. Thank you for the question. We don't break out the specifics, but I will take you back to why we love the TurboTax Live platform. One, there is more than 10 million people in the assisted segment that actually a trip and go to another person to help them with assistance within \u2013 and these are directional numbers. Within TurboTax, there is probably more than 10 million people that log in, but never actually finish their taxes. And then there is switching that happens back and forth between doing it yourself and then getting assistance. The reason I bring up those three figures is there is actually a lot of sort of movement in the tens of millions in each category and across the category between do-it-yourself and the systems. And it's all driven by a lack of confidence. Can I do this myself, did I do it right. And so when we look at the TurboTax Live platform and in fact, I would say TurboTax as a whole, that's why we are now a platform where you can do it yourself, we can do it with you or we can do it for you across the platform. So, our growth in TurboTax Live comes from all those three areas. They are those that switch from assisted, they are those that would have left DIY that now stay with us and vice versa. It helps us with a funnel metrics. So, that is the driver of where we are in TurboTax Live. That has been the driver looking backwards, and it will continue to be the driver looking ahead. Sure. First of all, we are really focused on the money benefit for our customers. And for those that live paycheck to paycheck to get five days early access to their refund is really meaningful. So, I am super proud of our team for what they are doing here and \u2013 because it really changes lives. With that said, we believe our hypothesis is, one, over time, this will actually help with TurboTax retention. These customers become new Credit Karma members. And then as you know, Credit Karma and the Credit Karma platform, we are really good at leveraging what we know about you with your permission to then really match you to financial products that are right for you and find ways to save money and get out of debt. So, it's new customers on a platform that already has over 120 million members that over time, as we engage them, we will be able to monetize. We do watch their behaviors. Do they keep the money on a Credit Karma Money, do they drain it, what we can help them with in terms of things they can do with that money to be able to build their credit. So, it's really \u2013 it truly feeds into the network effect of delivering benefits and the customers coming back for more benefits. Very welcome. Yes. Thanks for the question. First, I will start by saying our principles around acquisitions have not changed. For us, it is all about time to market and having a platform that can fundamentally power the prosperity of consumers and small businesses that we serve. And secondarily, we expect excellence from ourselves and our teams, and we expect these acquisitions to be building the kind of momentum that we are building, and we are \u2013 we have a set of mechanisms within our Intuit operating system where we monitor very closely our progress against the deliverables, and I mean the product and marketing deliverables and the talent on the team and their engagement to really ensure that things are on track. And really, everything with both of these acquisitions is about acceleration. We only integrate as long as it accelerates. And so we have a very I would say, good playbook in terms of how to make acquisitions. And in both cases, when you look at Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we bought the capabilities and the incredible talent because they do things that we are not great at and there are things we do that they are not great at and together as a family, we can create magic. So, with all of that said, it doesn't accelerate or decelerate what we are looking at from a time-to-market perspective, they are both on track in terms of our expectations. And we are very discrete in terms of how we allocate mind share and resources to both of these assets. And frankly, the biggest hindrance for future acquisitions is how good their management team is. It is not our mind share or our resources. So, that's the way we think about it. Very welcome. Yes, it's a really good question. First of all, I would tell you, having sort of experimented with our TurboTax Live basic offer is a good experiment and it worked. The biggest thing that I would tell you that we learned in this \u2013 particularly this last year is what really matters is speed to your taxes done with an expert and speed the money. And that is an area where we are doubling down going into next year because the majority of these customers, they want their taxes done right by an expert or if you do it for them and they want access to their money as soon as possible, both of which we can deliver on. And so really, in that context, folks that use an assisted method generally have more complex situation. And we would expect, over time, the higher SKUs that we have to play a bigger role when it comes to TurboTax Live. Yes. What is consistent is what I have shared before, which is, I would say, U.S. and Canada, and I will just use COVID as an example, coming out of \u2013 we are not out of COVID, but coming out of sort of the world shutting down, bounce back much faster than the other countries that we are in. In the UK, in Australia and France, there has been so many sort of start, stop, start-stop, that it's impacted the sort of building momentum in that country. And I don't mean to us, I just mean how consumers and small businesses thinking about managing their financial life. So, they are starting to bounce back, but they, for sure, are tracking behind the U.S. and Canada. And again, I will say that what it really excites us looking ahead is the possibilities to help customers grow their customers in small business with Mailchimp. That will be a bigger part of our future as we roll out our strategy and game plan and we believe that, that will be over the long-term, accretive to our growth. Yes. Thank you very much. Yes. Sure, Scott. Well, first of all, I will start with the headline, which is there could be. But now let me give you more specifics with the guidance and what we are talking to you about is for our fiscal year, which is through the end of July. And I will start at the top. The IRS returns through July, we are observing that it will be down three points, and it's driven by stimulus filers that didn't come back. About 30% of them were actually paying customers and IRS extensions being up. And in our base, they are nearly doubled. And so we have made some assumptions in terms of what will happen through July. And of course, we will talk to you all more as we talk about our guidance for next fiscal year because we have not made those estimates, and we won't communicate it today because our focus was what we communicate to you through July. But certainly, the extensions, most of those customers at some point come back, and \u2013 but we have not estimated what that will be after July. And we do expect just \u2013 so it said again that IRS total returns will be more normal next year because, in essence, this year, we are digesting what happened in the last 2 years because of all the stimulus filers and we would expect it to be more back to the normal flat or up as we look into the future. Yes. For sure. Let me start with the latter part of your question. When we look at the assisted category where there is more than a $20 billion TAM, and by the way, there is another $10 billion TAM, which is business tax that we have not talked about. So, in total, it's $30 billion. TurboTax Live is $1 billion. And so we have got a lot of runway. And as you have heard me talk in prior years, we are sort of in the early days, and we got a 10-year run here, hopefully, now that we have divulged how big TurboTax Live is, you can see how much runway we have. So, there is a lot of runway there. There is also a lot of runway in our underpenetrated segments. We are truly just getting started with Latinx, self-employed and the investor segment because we are actually under-shared in those segments based on all the data that we see. And so when we look at those segments, which is both do-it-yourself and in the assisted segment, we also have an equal runway. And we believe, down the road, the creator community \u2013 the creator segment will continue to become a larger part of those that choose to do taxes, and that's an area where we will be focused over time as well. So, that was a long answer to your short question. I think the headline I would leave you with is, yes, there is a runway for sure. And it's a multiyear runway in all of those areas. You're very welcome. Yes. Thanks for the question. And I will start with the first part of what you led with. When we look at the last 3 years and even more historically, IRS returns has been up about 1% and the DIY category has grown about 0.5 point. And so when you look at the last 3 years with all the anomalies, that also holds true. And the way we keep score is our share of the total IRS returns with respect to just now the platform that we have, where you can do it yourself or we will do it for you on the other spectrum. But specifically to answer your question, we do believe over time that the DIY category will continue to grow just as it has grown historically. So, we do believe that this is just I would say, a year where we are digesting all of the anomalies in the last 2 years. Yes. We have over 120 partners on our platform and these partners, they are big and they are small. And with that as context, are always experimenting and adjusting both in good times and not so good times, their credit cycle and they jump between bands, whether they are more interested in those that have a credit band below 620, which is subprime or between 620 to 700, which is prime or near prime and then, of course, anything over 700, which is prime. And the point is, based on our platform and the demand on our platform and the supply on our platform, we see very good supply across all of the bands because of the focus areas of the partners. And so that drives the strength that we saw this last quarter, and we would expect it going forward in context of our guidance. Yes. You're very welcome. Yes, Brad, great question because we are actually \u2013 we are done with our 3-year and 1-year plan and the way our cycle works is while we are in the heat of delivering this year, we finish our planning for next year. We look at a few things. One, we look at secular trends. We look at facts and figures on our platform. So, the secular trends are what I have mentioned earlier, which is a shift to using virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omnichannel and an acceleration to using digital money platform. So, we look at secular shifts and we look at the facts and figures around the secular shifts. We then look at all the things that actually happened on our platform and our share. If I just use a couple of examples, we have over $1.5 trillion of invoices that are generated on our small business platform. But as we shared last Investor Day and of course, this number is bigger now, our payments volume was over $90 billion. And so you look at \u2013 that's a very low share. When you look at our share of the assisted category in tax, very low share, when you look at our share of financial products on Credit Karma, credit cards, personal loans, very low share. So, we look at data around our share and our performance around our share. And then we will also look at economic factors like unemployment, like default rates, like projections around the economy. By the way, we are the best projector of the economy because of the data that we see on our small business platform. So, we look at all of those things. And then the way we put in \u2013 put together our plan is sort of worst case, middle case, best case. And that's how we manage the company. And by the way, this is something that we are quite good at. And then we manage based on the data that we see, we managed to ensure that we are protecting our long-term investor investments while we deliver for today for our customers. So, that's a little bit of a snapshot in terms of how we think about it. You're very welcome. Yes. So, I will. Hey, thank you, everyone, for making the time. Thank you for all your wonderful questions. As I said earlier, I am super proud of our employees across the company and our partners, and it's a real privilege and honor to be able to serve our members and customers in these unique times. And so all of you be safe, be well, and we will talk to you soon. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations.\nKim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Unfortunately, Michelle has lost her voice, so I will be reading her prepared remarks today. Sasan and I will take your questions during Q&A. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these prepared remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Second quarter results reflect continued strong momentum across the company as we execute on our strategy to be a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market, driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions and acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team's excellence in execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance. Second quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was driven by strong results from our Small Business and Self-Employed Group, Credit Karma and reflects an earlier start to the tax season compared to last year in the Consumer Group. Since tax season is now underway, let me start there. We are confident in our strategy of extending our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. Based on our analysis, we are on track to gain share overall again this season. This, and other early indicators, gives us reason to be excited about our innovation and go-to-market decisions. Our focus this season is threefold. First, we continue to aggressively transform the assisted category by reshaping how 88 million filers get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. This opens up the $20 billion assisted tax prep category for Intuit. Second, we're serving the underpenetrated segments of LatinX, Self-Employed and investor segments, which are growing faster than the overall tax filing. And third, we're serving millions of members on the Credit Karma platform with personalized experiences. Our team has developed a strong game plan to win this season, and we are on track to achieve our full year Consumer Group guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 88 million filers who have previously relied on an in-person assistant the opportunity to access expert help or have an expert to file their taxes for them. We have improved the experience for customers by applying artificial intelligence to match them with an expert who is right for their specific situation and to deliver insights to experts so they can provide excellent service. These capabilities are also now available in the Credit Karma app for members that use an assisted method to file their taxes last year. We are off to a strong start in our busy season with QuickBooks Live. We're now giving customers earlier visibility as to how their business is performing, getting their books cleaned up faster and connecting them with an expert easier. We've seen some of our strongest weeks of new customer acquisition in January and retention rates in our target customer segment increased several points versus a year ago. We believe QuickBooks Live will enable us to reach small and mid-market businesses that have not used financial management software. And we are eager to continue accelerating our momentum for this offering. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and connects them to insights and advice. In Credit Karma, we are innovating across all verticals. Our proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty. Credit Karma's data platform and engagement model creates powerful network effects. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners. We are solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers in the auto and home verticals. And in auto insurance, we'll continue to strengthen the Karma Drive program. We launched new features and experiences this tax season designed to help the majority of Credit Karma members filed easily with TurboTax and gain deeper insights into their finances. We're also offering tax filers early access to their refunds through direct deposit and refund advance program. First, Credit Karma launched a capability for members who previously filed with TurboTax to provide them with insights about their finances and taxes. Second, most Credit Karma members are able to file with TurboTax within the Credit Karma app and are eligible for special offers. And third, tax filers who choose to deposit their refund into a Credit Karma Money account will receive the refund up to 5 days early with direct deposit or get a portion of their refund in as little as 1 hour after the return is accepted through the TurboTax Refund Advance program. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and get access to personalized products across the platform, which accelerates engagement over time. Big picture, we continue to grow members by delivering personalized financial products, helping members save money, pay down debt and get faster access to their money while providing insights and advice. Over time, we are creating a virtuous cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transactions and monetization across our ecosystem. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we continue to improve discoverability, increased usage of features like Instant Deposit and roll out new innovations like Get Paid Upfront to help qualified customers get paid soon after the invoice is set. All of this innovation is driving strength in our charge volume. And in payroll, we continue to focus on making it easier for small businesses to pay their employees and provide them with expanded benefits. Nearly 40% of Americans say that they would struggle to pay an unexpected $400 emergency expense. We recently announced QuickBooks Early Pay, which will allow eligible employees pay through QuickBooks Online payroll to access money between paydays. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. Since the acquisition closed in November, we've been moving with speed to deliver for our customers. We're aggressively building a seamless integration between QuickBooks and Mailchimp to create a growth platform, investing in marketing and introducing the Intuit leadership playbook and operating system to execute at scale. Together, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. And this is where the real magic happens. Now shifting to the long term. We're also looking far ahead to anticipate our customers' future needs through our 6-year planning process, a part of Intuit's operating system, which we use to run the company. In December, our top leaders studied our customer problems and industry trends, the progress we've made since declaring our Big Bets 3 years ago and where we can have the largest impact in the future. This led to refreshing our 5 Big Bets to accelerate innovation, powering the prosperity of those that we serve. While our strategy remains durable and the essence of our big bets are the same, we have expanded the customer problems we want to solve and our vision for each Big Bet. For instance, as part of first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, we are accelerating investments in decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, enabling us to help customers put more money in their pockets faster. As part of our second Big Bet, connecting people to experts, we're reframing how we think about virtual experiences by exploring metaverse technologies and expanding the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting to play a more meaningful role in our customers' lives. We'll unpack this evolution in more detail at our Investor Day in the fall. We remain focused on our role as a strong corporate citizen and the impact we are making on the communities where we live and work to further our mission. Intuit was recently recognized by JUST Capital on its JUST 100 top-performing companies list for 2022 for our progress on DEI, along with our focus on climate change, worker wellness, job creation and customer privacy. Wrapping up, our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and demand for our platform, continue to put Intuit in a position of strength. Despite macro conditions such as rising inflation, supply chain issues, the Great Reshuffling and geopolitical conflicts, our platform continues to thrive as digitization is more important now than ever, supporting our customers' needs to put more money in their pockets and helping them run and grow their businesses. We are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper.  Now let me turn it over to Kim.\nKim Watkins : Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, up 70%, including 31 points from the addition of Mailchimp and Credit Karma, GAAP operating income of $56 million versus an operating loss of $25 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $612 million versus $235 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 versus $0.07 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55 versus $0.68 last year. After the quarter ended, we entered into an agreement that will resolve the majority of pending arbitration claims related to the Free File litigation without admitting any wrongdoing. This resulted in an immaterial charge reflected in our fiscal Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP results. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 47% during the quarter or 27% on an organic basis, excluding $240 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 74% or 37% excluding Mailchimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 35% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking grew 139% in fiscal Q2. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 39%. Mailchimp revenue recorded in online services was $240 million in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 226% in fiscal Q2 on a constant currency basis and 33% on an organic basis, excluding Mailchimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the second quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. As a reminder, this fall, we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect the desktop business to decline. Consumer Group revenue of $411 million grew 180% in Q2, reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. We are seeing a slower forming tax season taking into consideration both the earlier IRS open date this year and the latest IRS data. While still early in the season, our analysis shows we are on track to gain share overall, excluding users with the TurboTax free file offering in prior year periods. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2022. We continue to focus on our strategy to extend our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As a reminder, there are 4 key drivers of our Consumer Tax business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share and the fourth is average revenue per return.  Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 14% in Q2, also reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $444 million in Q2, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the quarter, we saw another record quarter driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals reflected momentum year-over-year in auto loans and home loans. And we are developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on April 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, including 26% to 28% revenue growth or 18% to 20% growth excluding Mailchimp. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 32% to 33%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.18 to $6.24 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.51 to $7.57. You can find our full Q3 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Mailchimp, the largest transaction in Intuit's history during the second quarter. We are working to finalize the purchase price accounting process, which could result in a onetime impact to our second quarter GAAP-only results and full year fiscal 2022 GAAP-only guidance we issued today. This process will not result in a change to the total consideration of the transaction. We expect to complete this process before we file our 10-Q. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kim. During our busiest season of the year, we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering the prosperities for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this quarter, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers. Now let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger : I guess I'd like to start with -- Sasan, what do you view -- I know we don't have a lot of color from the IRS, but could you go in a little bit to -- we started the tax season earlier, but it's a little uncommon because it seems to be starting slow. Could you speak a little bit to what's behind that? And then a follow-up to something else on that topic.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Scott. I would tell you, it's nothing unusual. Every year, I've been with the company 17 years and ran the TurboTax business for 3 years and every day -- every year, there seems to be a shift of consumer behavior shifting later and later in the year -- in the tax year. And primarily, it's because they know that they can. And especially now, I would say, with the fact that you can get access to an expert through our services versus relying on an in-person assistance and/or you can do it yourself, it's just consumer behavior shifting. I wouldn't read anything into it. It's not unusual. It is a trend that's been happening for years and it's continued this year.\nScott Schneeberger : Great. And obviously, that's what's behind the reinstatement of the guidance and the comfort in the full season. I guess just a double follow-up on this topic. I heard in Kim's remarks, Free File Alliance, it sounds like people who utilized TurboTax through Free File Alliance in the past may have stuck with you this year. If you could elaborate on that a little bit? And then also if you could touch upon last year, you saw a boon of premier customers from investments. Could you just speak to how that is trending this year?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes. For sure. Well, first of all, let me start with what Kim stated, the point Kim was trying to make was twofold. One, the fact that it is early in the season, but we are really happy with the fact that we are, in fact, taking share and that share that we are taking, we're just being explicit excludes those that filed in the Free File program. We'll see throughout season if some of those folks come back to us, which would be great. But that was really her comment. What you should take away is the way we keep score, which is our total share increasing as a total part of IRS returns, we are increasing share, and we're happy with our progress. Two, in terms of your question around investors, I would just say that as we've talked about often, there are really -- if I were to simplify 2 big strategic focus areas for us. One is really to fundamentally, make it easier for those that need assistance to get their taxes done through TurboTax Live. And then two, we are focused on 3 underpenetrated segments, investors, LatinX and those that are self-employed. And we feel good about the way the season has started, the way it's trending and given that there are simply is more people that have personally done stock trades, whether it's a stock or it's cryptocurrencies, we feel we're very well positioned with not only the experience that we have improved and how easy we make it for you to bring in your trade, but also the fact that we have an expert that -- are experts in this specific area around trading in cryptocurrency. And we've also upped our game in terms of how we are raising market awareness. We're being very clear that for those that have done trades, whether it's with cryptocurrencies or otherwise, we've got our experts that know and understand your situation, and we're delivering great experiences for them for those that are coming in. So we're very excited about our progress, and we're excited about the rest of the season as it relates to all 3 of those segments and particularly the investor segment that you asked about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty : I wanted to follow up on the Consumer Tax side. Based on what you know now, as you look at your targets for the year, has anything changed in terms of your assumptions on how you would achieve them in terms of how much of the growth would come from unit volume versus increased revenue per return?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, Sterling, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We -- things are playing out the way we had assumed, which is both a combination of really going after the assisted segment, along with the 3 underpenetrated segments that I just mentioned and thus far, it's playing out as we'd assumed. So no change in our assumptions based on everything that we are seeing with our KPIs.\nSterling Auty : All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up on Credit Karma. I get this a lot from investors. Any sense that you can give investors as to what a rising interest rate environment might do to the business profile or business trends for Credit Karma, either positive or negative?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. We don't really see an impact with rising interest rates, and I'll put it in 2 dimensions. One is consumers are always looking to access financial products, whether it's credit cards, personal loans, mortgage, auto loans, insurance, et cetera. So the demand continues, whether the interest rates are high or low because they're looking to access financial products. And two, financial institutions continue to invest even in a high interest rate market, especially in our platform because, in essence, their conversion is much higher on our platform because of Lightbox. And that's, by the way, why the demand will continue to be higher on our platform given that we have the Lightbox technology that really delivers a personalized financial product that's right for you at the lowest rate. So that's really one element. And I think the other element I would just remind us of is we are extremely low shared when you -- if I just use personal loans and credit cards as an example, what we shared at Investor Day, we have less than 5% share. So the more we continue to make a perfect match delivering personalized experiences for consumers, the more they're going to come on our platform, which is what we're seeing. And then the more financial institutions will invest in ensuring that their credit models on our Lightbox because they ultimately increase their conversion and their return on investment. So again, that was a long answer to your short question, I wanted to unpack it, but we don't see an impact of the demand is going to be there. And right now, financial institutions are really continuing to see a better trajectory than they did even a year or 2 years ago being on our platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan : Sasan, I am always petrified of paying taxes. So I will avoid taxes. I'll ask you about the QuickBooks Online Ecosystem. I've been watching the company embark on this journey of being able to get better attach rate for its payments and payroll products. It's been a very nice journey that's come along. And you -- at the point where you're breaking out online services as a separate business, which is fantastic. Can you talk to us a little bit about what are your aspirations for payment and payroll attached for your Small Business installed base? Where do you see that going? Especially with QuickBooks Advanced, do you see yourself being able to attack a different lens of the market opportunity, throwing Mailchimp, everything gets a little bit more interesting. But just curious to see how much more upside is there in that business? Because that seems like it's a very small business, but it could be potentially large given the size and volume of payments that are going through your backbone.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Kash. Great question. First of all, petrified or not, you're going to have to get your taxes done by April 15. That's a wonderful...\nKash Rangan : No question.\nSasan Goodarzi : Wonderful reason for us being in the tax business, slow-forming or not, taxes will get done by April 18. With that said, to answer your question, I'll start at the highest level and do maybe a couple of double clicks. One, one of the many reasons why we are so excited about the Small Business opportunities, it is a very, very large TAM. And our penetration in that total customer TAM is still well below 10% when you look at the number of customers we have and the addressable market in the countries that we are in. So one, penetration is low, which is a big fuel for current growth and our continued growth. The second is even within the customers that we have, our penetration of the services that they use, which are primarily manual, is even lower. So if you start at the top with low penetration, both customer TAM and then services TAM because it's primarily manual, it's not yet digital, if one paints the factual picture of how large the opportunity is. I think then secondly, you asked the question about our aspiration, and I mean this very intentionally. Our aspiration is that we want every customer on our platform to be able to use the services that we have, and we want 100% of the customers to use 100% of the services as long as it is relevant to them, which is why our quest has continued to make it drop-dead easy for customers to use our services. Which I think gets to the third point, and we are such a different company than even a year ago than 2 years ago, we truly have a very powerful network and ecosystem of services from managing your money in and money out, and helping you get organized on accounting to helping you with payments, both receiving and sending payments to not only payrolls but ultimately benefits that we offer employees to then lending capabilities. And then ultimately, all the capabilities that we are -- we now have and are integrating to be able to help you grow your business to put your business online, market your business and all the CRM capabilities. So we truly now have a suite of services to fuel the success of small businesses. And the reason we're seeing the services growth is because small businesses are seeing that by being on our platform and digitizing everything, it actually not only helps them grow, that helps them manage their cash and put more money in their pocket, but it helps them understand the profitability of their customers. And then the last thing I would say is actually what you just raised, which is very well positioned versus even where we were a couple of years ago in that we are not going upmarket to serve mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced. With that comes a 4x higher ARPC because they use more of the services that we have. And with QuickBooks Live, although very, very early days, because you're in essence engaging with advice and an expert, we are seeing hiring engagement in services than if you don't use those services. So when you take all of that into account, I think the headline is large TAM, low penetration. We've got the services that we need on our platform, and it's really about just delivering for our customers, and we have years of growth ahead of us. Thanks, Kash. And do your taxes by April 15. \nKash Rangan : No choice.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi : Just wanted to ask about your comment about new customer acquisition trend. You talked about earlier the lagging effect from new business creation. So as you looked at new business creation trend, how should we think about new customer acquisition as a growth driver for a QuickBooks? And also, as you're seeing the new cohort coming in, what kind of mix safety you're seeing for the higher ASP, like QuickBooks Advanced or other higher ASP products?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start by reminding all of us that the way we want you all to think about the model to make it simplistic is that we expect to grow new customers between 10% to 20%. And we expect to grow our ARPC between 10% to 20%, and that's ultimately how we will achieve -- achieving the online revenue growth, ecosystem revenue growth of 30% plus. So new customer acquisition is important to us, and we have many ways now to do it, both from serving the lower end of the market, which is, in essence, with QuickBooks Checking all the way to the top end of the market with QuickBooks Advanced, which serves the mid-market customers. The -- and as I mentioned just a moment ago, we have a very large TAM with low penetration. The new customer comment that I made was in context of QuickBooks Live. We are now, I think, in our third year in QuickBooks Slide. We've worked really hard to understand our customers' needs and get the product market fit. And just in the month of January, which is where the really, the busy season started, we saw some of our best weeks of customer acquisition. And which means, one, we're proud. Two, we're learning a ton, which positions us not only for the months to come, but for next year. And lastly, regarding new business formation, ultimately, the businesses that start using us are a bit more established. So we don't really rely on these business formations, although it's in the long term good for us because ultimately, all roads lead to QuickBooks platform especially now that we have capabilities to grow your business and run your business. But we don't get impacted significantly one way or the other with near-term new business formations. It's more established businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss : Congratulations on a really nice quarter. And maybe expanding a little bit on Siti's question there. Obviously, there's some pretty extraordinary events going on all around us right now, whether it's what's going on in Europe, whether it's the inflation numbers that we've been dealing with or in a Fed rate hiking cycle, which is difficult. It's a very volatile market environment. You guys have a great perspective on overall small business health. Can you give us an update kind of what you're seeing? Is any of this volatility starting to impact small businesses at all? And have you put any of that potential caution, if you will, because of this volatile environment into not raising your guidance because you guys had a really good Q2, particularly on the Small Business and Credit Karma side of the equation, but the full year guide doesn't really move?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And let me parse it into 2 pieces. One, I'll just remind us that when you look at the total small business market that we serve, which is up to 100 employees, almost 70% of those businesses are service-based businesses and about 30% are product-based businesses. And frankly, what we've seen, which is why I was intentional about putting this in my opening remarks, with the combination of what happened in COVID where everybody got stuck at home, and what's happening with inflation and supply chain issues, which doesn't really overall impact our service base business as much, it's more of the product-based businesses. There's just a shift to digitization because ultimately, small businesses see that they can be much more effective, much more efficient in running their business on our platform, and in fact, expanding the services that they use to digitize everything. So we are actually seeing that this environment, although none of us want to these supply chain issues, none of us want to see geopolitical issues. It is actually -- from a health standpoint, there's acceleration to I want to use digital platform. So that's, first and foremost, what we're seeing. And just to remember that the majority of our revenue is in the U.S. And although our aspirations are to be much, much more global, and we have 30% of our QuickBooks space outside of the U.S. the macro issues that impact -- that we got impacted with relative to COVID are already baked into what we see internationally. And so the strength of what we're talking about is based on the fact that small businesses again, see this as an opportunity to digitize and we just think it's the beginning of it. It is a secular shift.  Let me actually answer your second question around guidance. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing strength in Small Business and in Credit Karma. And we actually are not seeing a tapering that we initially thought we would see in Credit Karma. So there's strength across every segment of the company. And that includes tax. It's just a slower-forming season. And with that said, as you know, we raised our guidance in the first quarter of the year, which is very, very unlike us. And we simply just want to get through tax season, and we'll relook at our guidance next quarter. But we are continuing to see strength in all the segments.\nKeith Weiss : Got it. And on the Credit Karma, I did notice the strength in credit card, also the strength in Credit Karma margins. I know Michelle doesn't have a voice right now, but I know you could take it. Anything that we should be thinking about in terms of the second half of the year, why those margins wouldn't be sustainable?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Keith, in general, I would not pay too much attention to the ups or downs in our margins by segment. We truly manage the company margins at the company level -- and we not just -- we don't manage it just for the sake of managing it at the company level. The number of investments that we make across the platform to fuel our innovation forces us to really think holistically to ensure that we don't short-change any segment at the company level. So if it's too high 1 quarter, I wouldn't get too excited. If it's low 1 quarter, I wouldn't wonder why it's low. We managed it at the company level. And as you know, we've been expanding margins and it's built into our guidance. And I feel good about our margin expansion. I just wouldn't pay too much attention to the segment level.\nKeith Weiss : Sasan, that's remarkable. It's exactly the same answer Michelle would have given.\nSasan Goodarzi : Well, that's why we're partners in crime.\nKeith Weiss : Exactly. Excellent. Congratulations...\nSasan Goodarzi : And she's smiling, you can't see it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick : Excellent. And I'll echo the congrats on a great quarter. Sasan, I listened carefully to your response to the first question to say that perhaps TurboTax Live was one factor that helped to get filers more comfortable, that they can be more relaxed and maybe file a little bit later. Is there anything that you see specifically in terms of live adoption that gives you optimism for what it can be as a percentage of the mix for the full season?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, Brad, thank you for your question. I'll tell you, I'm starting to lose count, but I think this is our fourth year with TurboTax Live and as you know, this year, we are -- TurboTax is truly a platform. You can bounce back and forth between the platform from doing it yourself to getting access to an expert to help you in any which way you want to ultimately doing your taxes for you. And really where we've upped our game this year, which is a true differentiator to get folks to switch is the expertise of the experts. Because ultimately, what customers care about is if I'm a plumber or if I'm an investor or if I'm self-employed, if I worked in 2, 3 states, I want to know that you understand my situation, which is why we've invested so much time not only in improving that matching by applying AI, but also making sure that the collaboration experience is seamless because a lot of this advice can also be done through AI. That was a long way to answer your question. We are bullish about TurboTax Live. We are bullish about the 10 million customers that have churned within the assisted category. What we talked about at Investor Day last year, which is 17 million people that started TurboTax but never finished. And we like what we see, and we'll report out on where it all ended in our earnings in May. But it's playing a big role in what we would expect, both going after assisted, but also going after the underpenetrated segments, which actually look to assistance more than otherwise.\nBrad Zelnick : That's very helpful, Sasan. And maybe just a follow-up, either for you or for Kim. I think in your prepared remarks, and I think it was a Small Business comment, you talked about retention in target customers increasing several points. I just want to make sure I have that right. And if you can clarify it and unpack that first, that would be great.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes, for sure, Brad. Let me parse it into 2 parts. One, what we talked about relative to last year was that our overall retention rates in Small Business were actually up full stop. What I -- the comment that I made in our opening remarks was that we're seeing a lot of goodness in QuickBooks Live, both in the start of the season, both in terms of new customer acquisitions where we've had record weeks and for the cohort of customers that we are focused on in certain segments, our retention is up in QuickBooks Live. And both of those are really, really important because we want to not only acquire the customers, but deliver the service that they need so they stay with us and come back, and that was -- that was the point I alluded to in the remarks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne : I'll echo the congrats on a nice quarter. Sasan, can you just talk about some of the early learnings maybe from Mailchimp just in terms of go-to-market, what you've learned about sort of the cross-pollination of your clients? And also, how far out are we in terms of having a bit more harmonized back end between Mailchimp and QuickBooks. And what should we expect on that from a sort of technical integration perspective?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes. Sure, Kirk. So let me just quickly touch on these 3 priorities that we have that we're maniacally focused on.  One is to create this growth platform where really the magic is what we do behind the scenes with the data. It's combining the customer data, along with the purchase data to really help them understand where to target, where they can grow wallet share what the profitability of their customers are, et cetera. And that's extremely powerful for our customers, not only to grow the services within our overall platform, but also to acquire new customers because the reality is we will be the only platform that has this capability in one place.  The second is to position ourselves together to pursue mid-market because this is even a bigger need as you could imagine, in mid-market. And then third, half of their business is outside of the U.S. And frankly, other than having a wonderful drop-dead easy platform you haven't spent a lot of efforts internationally, and we are doubling down international.  To answer your question on several months in, we're more excited about the capabilities of what is possible than we were even before and are even more intentional about the work that we need to do to bring these 3 priorities to life. If I were to paint a sort of general picture, I would say we'll probably be in a place in about a year where we're really seeing the impact of the momentum of these priorities as it relates to our outcomes and our results because we've inserted in Mailchimp some of our best product people that really understand QuickBooks, really understand this space that are building out the platform with, of course, the Mailchimp engineers, which are all part of Intuit. And we think getting this right and we know how to get it right, we think about a year or so, we'll start seeing the impact of the priorities that we are focused on. The good news is we know how to do it, and there's no surprises there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin : Nice job to Kim stepping in there. We've seen it and enjoyed the ad campaigns of late. Is there anything you can add around engagements or early returns you're seeing on some of those programs? And maybe Sasan if you could expand on your view around striking the right balance between maintaining the powerful brand of each individual property, I think they're all fairly well known and established as separate entities versus presenting Intuit as a more holistic platform, that would be great.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Great. Thank you for your question, Michael. I'll start with the latter one first. And I think it was really importantly stated it in your question. We have very powerful brands that our customers love and use, Mailchimp, TurboTax, Credit Karma and QuickBooks. And our intent is to really from a brand perspective, convey that they are connected and connected means that you get more benefit as a customer and the power of those benefits in really fueling your success as an individual or as a business. So all that means is the brands are powerful, the brands are not going to go away. It's about how we invest to make the connection in the minds of customers that this is all Intuit and by the way, here's why you should care. The second element around the campaigns, it's -- it's early, but we're actually -- and my comments specifically around TurboTax as I assume that's what you were asking about if it's broader, please come back and ask the other elements of your question. We're really pleased with our campaign so far this year. And our intent going in was to really communicate this year that we have experts that understand your situation. If you look at our campaigns, both on-air and digitally, you'll see things around communicating to those that are self-employed, communicating to those that have moved multiple states, communicating to those that have made investments in helping them understand no matter what your situation is, we have an expert that can help your situation. And we've invested heavily in not only who we bring on board, but also our AI capabilities, not only to make that perfect match but also to deliver insights to those experts to make them much more effective and productive so we can do things at scale. So the consideration, awareness and understanding of what we're trying to communicate, so far has been very well received. And then, of course, we'll know more as we go through season. That's about just our results, but we do a lot of mix -- marketing mix modeling work to understand what was effective, how can we improve our game going forward. And we did this across the company, but we'll better understand the impact with data. So far, the qualitatively and early data has been very positive.\nMichael Turrin : We saw the DJ Khaled commercials at the Super Bowl as well. Those were also great.\nSasan Goodarzi : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong : Fantastic. I wanted to just touch on Credit Karma as a channel for TurboTax. Last year, very effective in terms of driving new customer adoption. I kind of saw last year was the trial year and this year is the first real push. Just would love a sense of what you're seeing from a consumer engagement perspective in the first few weeks of tax season.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, Ken, great question. Let me just say it's twofold. One, we've gone in really big within TurboTax exposing TurboTax customers to Credit Karma where they can put their refund on a Credit Karma Money account, where they will get 5 days early access and really tax time, it's all about the money. And then these folks become new Credit Karma members and that we can expose them to the Credit Karma platform. We're really pleased with where that's going and the progress that we made. Of course, I won't share any stats with you, but we are -- I'll just leave it as we're very pleased. The second is last year, it almost wasn't even a trial year in Credit Karma. We sort of threw in TurboTax into the Credit Karma app. This year is really the first year where TurboTax, you can actually get your taxes done within the Credit Karma app. And for most cases, you don't actually have to go to TurboTax, which is a far, far better experience. We're getting wonderful learnings and adjusting real-time. We are, for the long term, really bullish about the -- not only all TurboTax customers using Credit Karma, but hopefully getting all Credit Karma members that already don't do their taxes with TurboTax, the BA TurboTax users. So, so far, we love what we're learning, the adjustments that we're making, and we continue to remain very bullish about just the whole prospect of why we're doing the integration between these 2 platforms and the impact that it's having for our members and TurboTax customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolf Research.\nAlex Zukin : Sasan, maybe just one multipart one for me. I'm looking at the SMB online ecosystem number, and it looks like ex Mailchimp, growth there was about 4% sequentially. And I want to understand if you could unpack what's driving that? Because I'm trying to understand was Q1 like unseasonably strong and Q2 is kind of back to normal? Or what's the right way to think about that, unpack maybe the drivers between payroll payments and capital and time tracking? And how do we think about that in the second half of the year growing sequentially because year-over-year, it's accelerating and it's fantastic. But just looking back at history, understanding that a little bit better, I think it would be helpful.\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Alex. Very good question. So first of all, I'll start with the obvious, which is overall, Small Business grew 24%. This is all excluding Mailchimp. And our Online Ecosystem revenue growth grew 37%. And as you know, our goal is to grow over 30%. So we actually had a extremely strong quarters. So I'm not sure what the sequential number is that you were throwing out there, but we had a very, very strong quarter, well above our 30% mark. And it's based on strength in volume and the mix of customers that are coming in and particularly the services that they are using across payments, payroll, time tracking and QuickBooks Capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to see strength in Small Business and Credit Karma in the second half of the year. We don't expect a tapering. And as I mentioned earlier, we just really want to get through tax season and talk about our guidance after the quarter. So I wouldn't read anything into the fact that Small Business is going to taper. I would say, focused on our compass, which is we want to grow north of 30% with our Online Ecosystem revenue and we actually are seeing great strength.\nAlex Zukin : And then, Sasan, you mentioned Credit Karma a couple of times. You've gotten asked the question and kind of how you're seeing even more strength than you anticipated to some extent, no tapering, if you will. How is the progression of synergies going with Credit Karma within the Online Ecosystem business specifically? What are you seeing there? What learnings? And if you look at areas where you feel like there's an ability to double down and see even more growth, where would those be?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, Alex, the -- strategically, the biggest area that we've been focused on has been really integrating Credit Karma into the TurboTax experience and then vice versa. So what that means is if you're a TurboTax customer at the end, one of the first options that you get is to put your refund on a Credit Karma Money account. And as I mentioned a moment ago, that was a strategic thesis that we had, and it's going really well. And these become new Credit Karma members and then we can expose other benefits on the Credit Karma platform to those customers. The second is building out within the Credit Karma app the TurboTax experience and contextually engaging customers with helping them get their taxes done. And to say we're in the early days is interesting, right, because we're only a year in. We like the progress that we're seeing, and that's the area where we're more than doubling down because we're literally only a year-end, and there's just so much opportunity ahead of us, and we're actually seeing the green shoots. The other, Alex, is integrating Credit Karma as part of the payroll platform. So if you want to ultimately get earlier access to your money, you can put your money on a Credit Karma Money account, that's another area. But the primary focus has been creating this one consumer platform between TurboTax and Credit Karma.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.\nBrent Thill : Sasan, you've had some pretty healthy price hikes from the full-service solution, anywhere between 25% and 50% from last year's tax season. I'm just curious if you could just give us a sense of how that's resonating and they are fairly healthy in terms of hike. What -- in terms of just the justification of how big that was, can you just walk through what drove that decision on the pricing side?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Brent. As we always do, we have pricing principles, and we run a lot of tests, and there are multiple holistic things that we did in our lineup this year. And let me start with where you didn't ask the question because it's relevant to the overall answer to your question. One, for our free customers, we actually expanded it to include student loans for free and refund transfer for free. That was one very important decision that we made. When we looked at our TurboTax Live platform to continue to really accelerate bringing more customers into the category from prior assisted, we also, for simple filers, announce, you can do it anyway you wish, do it yourself or with a live platform for a certain time period and you pay nothing. And we like the progress and the impact that we're seeing there. The third is we ran a lot of tests for TurboTax Live and particularly full service and what we learned in some ways, unsurprisingly, is price is not a big factor. It's about confidence and access to an expertise. And what we realized is having early season pricing and then later season pricing didn't really have much of an impact. So one, there is no early or late season pricing. It's one flat pricing. And two, we had a lot of room to move up on pricing, and we made a decision based on a lot of testing to move the price up. So those were a few strategic decisions that we've made. And as we back-test our decisions, it's playing out exactly as we thought, which is these are not really that price-sensitive customers, although they love our price versus other alternatives. It's more, can I get access to the expert that I want? And can I get -- confidently have somebody to get my taxes done for me? And that's what we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow : I almost apologize for the question, Sasan, but the Desktop is an area that we understand it's not your focus, et cetera. But like you just keep reporting actually numbers that are better. Can you talk -- better than you talked to. Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers there in the sustainability?\nSasan Goodarzi : Sure. I think I'll just say 2 things. One, these are resilient customers and they continue to love their Desktop products, and they always surprise us relative to wanting to come back to desktop. And really, that's a simple answer to your question on what we continue to see. I think the second thing that we're very excited about and so I would say our -- the majority of our customers is really moving to a subscription-based approach where they can leverage a lot of the services that we now create in the cloud, and that will drive even a higher subscription element of our business and it will also give our customers the ability to access more features and functionalities and that's something that we started rolling out this year and will be primarily subscription-based as we look into the future.\nKim Watkins : If I could add 2 things to that, Raimo, just to remind you of some things that were mentioned in the script, too. The big growth driver in the quarter was Desktop Enterprise, which grew low double digits in the second quarter, and that's up from high single digits in the first quarter. Similar to what Sasan mentioned, that was -- that specifically for the Desktop Enterprise with customer growth and price increases there. So really something to consider. That's the piece that's growing within that. And then longer term, we're not expecting this business to decline, especially headwinds from the subscription model transition in the second half of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta : Sasan, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Credit Karma. Last year was just an amazing year in terms of the number of credit cards issued, and it seems like credit card issuers really battling for customers. I'm wondering, in your opinion, does that cause any comparison issue for you guys as you look at this year? And do you see that demand waning at all?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes, Kartik, thanks for your question. If you recall, probably a couple of quarters ago, Michelle and I both talked about the fact that we expect a tapering of originations in the second half of the year, we would expect to continue to see strength because of our execution and because of Lightbox and the fact that we really deliver personalized experiences, which is good for members and good for partners, but we expect a tapering of origination. And we haven't seen the type of tapering that we thought we would see, which is why we continue to see the strength that we're experiencing and what we would expect in the second half of the year.\nKartik Mehta : And then just one on tax, so from a competitive standpoint, have you seen anything that you're surprised by that competitors are doing that -- ones that would say to you, hey, we need to make any changes? Just any changes that you're surprised by from a competitive standpoint?\nSasan Goodarzi : Part of our playbook is, as a company is we do a lot of scenario planning customer back, and it's really primarily focused on making sure we're obsessed with our customers and what other alternatives could be presented to our customers that could be far more compelling. So just as part of our playbook, we do that quite well, and we particularly are probably one of the best at it across the company in tax. So just know that, that is part of our playbook. And I would just tell you that this year, we've probably been the least surprised. And so no, it is not -- there's no surprises that's informing anything differently that we're doing the rest of the season.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel.\nBrad Reback : Sasan, obviously, it's a difficult hiring environment out there. Do you guys feel pretty good about where you are for the Live product to meet demand here in the next couple of weeks from a headcount perspective?\nSasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks, Brad. The very short answer is absolutely. We actually, believe it or not, feel the best this year than we have in prior years just because we've gotten so good at what we need to do. We're several years into this and because many experts actually want to be on our platform. So we are absolutely fine on hiring.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over for any remarks.\nSasan Goodarzi : All right. Excellent. Well, listen, everyone, thank you so much for all of your wonderful questions. Be safe out there. Take good care of yourselves, and we look forward to talking to you in May. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Second quarter results reflect continued strong momentum across the company as we execute on our strategy to be a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market, driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions and acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team's excellence in execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance. Second quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was driven by strong results from our Small Business and Self-Employed Group, Credit Karma and reflects an earlier start to the tax season compared to last year in the Consumer Group. Since tax season is now underway, let me start there. We are confident in our strategy of extending our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. Based on our analysis, we are on track to gain share overall again this season. This, and other early indicators, gives us reason to be excited about our innovation and go-to-market decisions. Our focus this season is threefold. First, we continue to aggressively transform the assisted category by reshaping how 88 million filers get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. This opens up the $20 billion assisted tax prep category for Intuit. Second, we're serving the underpenetrated segments of LatinX, Self-Employed and investor segments, which are growing faster than the overall tax filing. And third, we're serving millions of members on the Credit Karma platform with personalized experiences. Our team has developed a strong game plan to win this season, and we are on track to achieve our full year Consumer Group guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 88 million filers who have previously relied on an in-person assistant the opportunity to access expert help or have an expert to file their taxes for them. We have improved the experience for customers by applying artificial intelligence to match them with an expert who is right for their specific situation and to deliver insights to experts so they can provide excellent service. These capabilities are also now available in the Credit Karma app for members that use an assisted method to file their taxes last year. We are off to a strong start in our busy season with QuickBooks Live. We're now giving customers earlier visibility as to how their business is performing, getting their books cleaned up faster and connecting them with an expert easier. We've seen some of our strongest weeks of new customer acquisition in January and retention rates in our target customer segment increased several points versus a year ago. We believe QuickBooks Live will enable us to reach small and mid-market businesses that have not used financial management software. And we are eager to continue accelerating our momentum for this offering. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and connects them to insights and advice. In Credit Karma, we are innovating across all verticals. Our proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty. Credit Karma's data platform and engagement model creates powerful network effects. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners. We are solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers in the auto and home verticals. And in auto insurance, we'll continue to strengthen the Karma Drive program. We launched new features and experiences this tax season designed to help the majority of Credit Karma members filed easily with TurboTax and gain deeper insights into their finances. We're also offering tax filers early access to their refunds through direct deposit and refund advance program. First, Credit Karma launched a capability for members who previously filed with TurboTax to provide them with insights about their finances and taxes. Second, most Credit Karma members are able to file with TurboTax within the Credit Karma app and are eligible for special offers. And third, tax filers who choose to deposit their refund into a Credit Karma Money account will receive the refund up to 5 days early with direct deposit or get a portion of their refund in as little as 1 hour after the return is accepted through the TurboTax Refund Advance program. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and get access to personalized products across the platform, which accelerates engagement over time. Big picture, we continue to grow members by delivering personalized financial products, helping members save money, pay down debt and get faster access to their money while providing insights and advice. Over time, we are creating a virtuous cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transactions and monetization across our ecosystem. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we continue to improve discoverability, increased usage of features like Instant Deposit and roll out new innovations like Get Paid Upfront to help qualified customers get paid soon after the invoice is set. All of this innovation is driving strength in our charge volume. And in payroll, we continue to focus on making it easier for small businesses to pay their employees and provide them with expanded benefits. Nearly 40% of Americans say that they would struggle to pay an unexpected $400 emergency expense. We recently announced QuickBooks Early Pay, which will allow eligible employees pay through QuickBooks Online payroll to access money between paydays. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. Since the acquisition closed in November, we've been moving with speed to deliver for our customers. We're aggressively building a seamless integration between QuickBooks and Mailchimp to create a growth platform, investing in marketing and introducing the Intuit leadership playbook and operating system to execute at scale. Together, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. And this is where the real magic happens. Now shifting to the long term. We're also looking far ahead to anticipate our customers' future needs through our 6-year planning process, a part of Intuit's operating system, which we use to run the company. In December, our top leaders studied our customer problems and industry trends, the progress we've made since declaring our Big Bets 3 years ago and where we can have the largest impact in the future. This led to refreshing our 5 Big Bets to accelerate innovation, powering the prosperity of those that we serve. While our strategy remains durable and the essence of our big bets are the same, we have expanded the customer problems we want to solve and our vision for each Big Bet. For instance, as part of first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, we are accelerating investments in decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, enabling us to help customers put more money in their pockets faster. As part of our second Big Bet, connecting people to experts, we're reframing how we think about virtual experiences by exploring metaverse technologies and expanding the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting to play a more meaningful role in our customers' lives. We'll unpack this evolution in more detail at our Investor Day in the fall. We remain focused on our role as a strong corporate citizen and the impact we are making on the communities where we live and work to further our mission. Intuit was recently recognized by JUST Capital on its JUST 100 top-performing companies list for 2022 for our progress on DEI, along with our focus on climate change, worker wellness, job creation and customer privacy. Wrapping up, our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and demand for our platform, continue to put Intuit in a position of strength. Despite macro conditions such as rising inflation, supply chain issues, the Great Reshuffling and geopolitical conflicts, our platform continues to thrive as digitization is more important now than ever, supporting our customers' needs to put more money in their pockets and helping them run and grow their businesses. We are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper.  Now let me turn it over to Kim. Great. Thank you, Kim. During our busiest season of the year, we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering the prosperities for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this quarter, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers. Now let's open it up to your questions. Yes. Sure, Scott. I would tell you, it's nothing unusual. Every year, I've been with the company 17 years and ran the TurboTax business for 3 years and every day -- every year, there seems to be a shift of consumer behavior shifting later and later in the year -- in the tax year. And primarily, it's because they know that they can. And especially now, I would say, with the fact that you can get access to an expert through our services versus relying on an in-person assistance and/or you can do it yourself, it's just consumer behavior shifting. I wouldn't read anything into it. It's not unusual. It is a trend that's been happening for years and it's continued this year. Yes, yes. For sure. Well, first of all, let me start with what Kim stated, the point Kim was trying to make was twofold. One, the fact that it is early in the season, but we are really happy with the fact that we are, in fact, taking share and that share that we are taking, we're just being explicit excludes those that filed in the Free File program. We'll see throughout season if some of those folks come back to us, which would be great. But that was really her comment. What you should take away is the way we keep score, which is our total share increasing as a total part of IRS returns, we are increasing share, and we're happy with our progress. Two, in terms of your question around investors, I would just say that as we've talked about often, there are really -- if I were to simplify 2 big strategic focus areas for us. One is really to fundamentally, make it easier for those that need assistance to get their taxes done through TurboTax Live. And then two, we are focused on 3 underpenetrated segments, investors, LatinX and those that are self-employed. And we feel good about the way the season has started, the way it's trending and given that there are simply is more people that have personally done stock trades, whether it's a stock or it's cryptocurrencies, we feel we're very well positioned with not only the experience that we have improved and how easy we make it for you to bring in your trade, but also the fact that we have an expert that -- are experts in this specific area around trading in cryptocurrency. And we've also upped our game in terms of how we are raising market awareness. We're being very clear that for those that have done trades, whether it's with cryptocurrencies or otherwise, we've got our experts that know and understand your situation, and we're delivering great experiences for them for those that are coming in. So we're very excited about our progress, and we're excited about the rest of the season as it relates to all 3 of those segments and particularly the investor segment that you asked about. Yes, Sterling, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We -- things are playing out the way we had assumed, which is both a combination of really going after the assisted segment, along with the 3 underpenetrated segments that I just mentioned and thus far, it's playing out as we'd assumed. So no change in our assumptions based on everything that we are seeing with our KPIs. Yes. We don't really see an impact with rising interest rates, and I'll put it in 2 dimensions. One is consumers are always looking to access financial products, whether it's credit cards, personal loans, mortgage, auto loans, insurance, et cetera. So the demand continues, whether the interest rates are high or low because they're looking to access financial products. And two, financial institutions continue to invest even in a high interest rate market, especially in our platform because, in essence, their conversion is much higher on our platform because of Lightbox. And that's, by the way, why the demand will continue to be higher on our platform given that we have the Lightbox technology that really delivers a personalized financial product that's right for you at the lowest rate. So that's really one element. And I think the other element I would just remind us of is we are extremely low shared when you -- if I just use personal loans and credit cards as an example, what we shared at Investor Day, we have less than 5% share. So the more we continue to make a perfect match delivering personalized experiences for consumers, the more they're going to come on our platform, which is what we're seeing. And then the more financial institutions will invest in ensuring that their credit models on our Lightbox because they ultimately increase their conversion and their return on investment. So again, that was a long answer to your short question, I wanted to unpack it, but we don't see an impact of the demand is going to be there. And right now, financial institutions are really continuing to see a better trajectory than they did even a year or 2 years ago being on our platform. Yes. Sure, Kash. Great question. First of all, petrified or not, you're going to have to get your taxes done by April 15. That's a wonderful... Wonderful reason for us being in the tax business, slow-forming or not, taxes will get done by April 18. With that said, to answer your question, I'll start at the highest level and do maybe a couple of double clicks. One, one of the many reasons why we are so excited about the Small Business opportunities, it is a very, very large TAM. And our penetration in that total customer TAM is still well below 10% when you look at the number of customers we have and the addressable market in the countries that we are in. So one, penetration is low, which is a big fuel for current growth and our continued growth. The second is even within the customers that we have, our penetration of the services that they use, which are primarily manual, is even lower. So if you start at the top with low penetration, both customer TAM and then services TAM because it's primarily manual, it's not yet digital, if one paints the factual picture of how large the opportunity is. I think then secondly, you asked the question about our aspiration, and I mean this very intentionally. Our aspiration is that we want every customer on our platform to be able to use the services that we have, and we want 100% of the customers to use 100% of the services as long as it is relevant to them, which is why our quest has continued to make it drop-dead easy for customers to use our services. Which I think gets to the third point, and we are such a different company than even a year ago than 2 years ago, we truly have a very powerful network and ecosystem of services from managing your money in and money out, and helping you get organized on accounting to helping you with payments, both receiving and sending payments to not only payrolls but ultimately benefits that we offer employees to then lending capabilities. And then ultimately, all the capabilities that we are -- we now have and are integrating to be able to help you grow your business to put your business online, market your business and all the CRM capabilities. So we truly now have a suite of services to fuel the success of small businesses. And the reason we're seeing the services growth is because small businesses are seeing that by being on our platform and digitizing everything, it actually not only helps them grow, that helps them manage their cash and put more money in their pocket, but it helps them understand the profitability of their customers. And then the last thing I would say is actually what you just raised, which is very well positioned versus even where we were a couple of years ago in that we are not going upmarket to serve mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced. With that comes a 4x higher ARPC because they use more of the services that we have. And with QuickBooks Live, although very, very early days, because you're in essence engaging with advice and an expert, we are seeing hiring engagement in services than if you don't use those services. So when you take all of that into account, I think the headline is large TAM, low penetration. We've got the services that we need on our platform, and it's really about just delivering for our customers, and we have years of growth ahead of us. Thanks, Kash. And do your taxes by April 15. Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start by reminding all of us that the way we want you all to think about the model to make it simplistic is that we expect to grow new customers between 10% to 20%. And we expect to grow our ARPC between 10% to 20%, and that's ultimately how we will achieve -- achieving the online revenue growth, ecosystem revenue growth of 30% plus. So new customer acquisition is important to us, and we have many ways now to do it, both from serving the lower end of the market, which is, in essence, with QuickBooks Checking all the way to the top end of the market with QuickBooks Advanced, which serves the mid-market customers. The -- and as I mentioned just a moment ago, we have a very large TAM with low penetration. The new customer comment that I made was in context of QuickBooks Live. We are now, I think, in our third year in QuickBooks Slide. We've worked really hard to understand our customers' needs and get the product market fit. And just in the month of January, which is where the really, the busy season started, we saw some of our best weeks of customer acquisition. And which means, one, we're proud. Two, we're learning a ton, which positions us not only for the months to come, but for next year. And lastly, regarding new business formation, ultimately, the businesses that start using us are a bit more established. So we don't really rely on these business formations, although it's in the long term good for us because ultimately, all roads lead to QuickBooks platform especially now that we have capabilities to grow your business and run your business. But we don't get impacted significantly one way or the other with near-term new business formations. It's more established businesses. Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And let me parse it into 2 pieces. One, I'll just remind us that when you look at the total small business market that we serve, which is up to 100 employees, almost 70% of those businesses are service-based businesses and about 30% are product-based businesses. And frankly, what we've seen, which is why I was intentional about putting this in my opening remarks, with the combination of what happened in COVID where everybody got stuck at home, and what's happening with inflation and supply chain issues, which doesn't really overall impact our service base business as much, it's more of the product-based businesses. There's just a shift to digitization because ultimately, small businesses see that they can be much more effective, much more efficient in running their business on our platform, and in fact, expanding the services that they use to digitize everything. So we are actually seeing that this environment, although none of us want to these supply chain issues, none of us want to see geopolitical issues. It is actually -- from a health standpoint, there's acceleration to I want to use digital platform. So that's, first and foremost, what we're seeing. And just to remember that the majority of our revenue is in the U.S. And although our aspirations are to be much, much more global, and we have 30% of our QuickBooks space outside of the U.S. the macro issues that impact -- that we got impacted with relative to COVID are already baked into what we see internationally. And so the strength of what we're talking about is based on the fact that small businesses again, see this as an opportunity to digitize and we just think it's the beginning of it. It is a secular shift.  Let me actually answer your second question around guidance. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing strength in Small Business and in Credit Karma. And we actually are not seeing a tapering that we initially thought we would see in Credit Karma. So there's strength across every segment of the company. And that includes tax. It's just a slower-forming season. And with that said, as you know, we raised our guidance in the first quarter of the year, which is very, very unlike us. And we simply just want to get through tax season, and we'll relook at our guidance next quarter. But we are continuing to see strength in all the segments. Yes. Keith, in general, I would not pay too much attention to the ups or downs in our margins by segment. We truly manage the company margins at the company level -- and we not just -- we don't manage it just for the sake of managing it at the company level. The number of investments that we make across the platform to fuel our innovation forces us to really think holistically to ensure that we don't short-change any segment at the company level. So if it's too high 1 quarter, I wouldn't get too excited. If it's low 1 quarter, I wouldn't wonder why it's low. We managed it at the company level. And as you know, we've been expanding margins and it's built into our guidance. And I feel good about our margin expansion. I just wouldn't pay too much attention to the segment level. Well, that's why we're partners in crime. And she's smiling, you can't see it. Yes, Brad, thank you for your question. I'll tell you, I'm starting to lose count, but I think this is our fourth year with TurboTax Live and as you know, this year, we are -- TurboTax is truly a platform. You can bounce back and forth between the platform from doing it yourself to getting access to an expert to help you in any which way you want to ultimately doing your taxes for you. And really where we've upped our game this year, which is a true differentiator to get folks to switch is the expertise of the experts. Because ultimately, what customers care about is if I'm a plumber or if I'm an investor or if I'm self-employed, if I worked in 2, 3 states, I want to know that you understand my situation, which is why we've invested so much time not only in improving that matching by applying AI, but also making sure that the collaboration experience is seamless because a lot of this advice can also be done through AI. That was a long way to answer your question. We are bullish about TurboTax Live. We are bullish about the 10 million customers that have churned within the assisted category. What we talked about at Investor Day last year, which is 17 million people that started TurboTax but never finished. And we like what we see, and we'll report out on where it all ended in our earnings in May. But it's playing a big role in what we would expect, both going after assisted, but also going after the underpenetrated segments, which actually look to assistance more than otherwise. Yes, yes, for sure, Brad. Let me parse it into 2 parts. One, what we talked about relative to last year was that our overall retention rates in Small Business were actually up full stop. What I -- the comment that I made in our opening remarks was that we're seeing a lot of goodness in QuickBooks Live, both in the start of the season, both in terms of new customer acquisitions where we've had record weeks and for the cohort of customers that we are focused on in certain segments, our retention is up in QuickBooks Live. And both of those are really, really important because we want to not only acquire the customers, but deliver the service that they need so they stay with us and come back, and that was -- that was the point I alluded to in the remarks. Yes, yes. Sure, Kirk. So let me just quickly touch on these 3 priorities that we have that we're maniacally focused on.  One is to create this growth platform where really the magic is what we do behind the scenes with the data. It's combining the customer data, along with the purchase data to really help them understand where to target, where they can grow wallet share what the profitability of their customers are, et cetera. And that's extremely powerful for our customers, not only to grow the services within our overall platform, but also to acquire new customers because the reality is we will be the only platform that has this capability in one place.  The second is to position ourselves together to pursue mid-market because this is even a bigger need as you could imagine, in mid-market. And then third, half of their business is outside of the U.S. And frankly, other than having a wonderful drop-dead easy platform you haven't spent a lot of efforts internationally, and we are doubling down international.  To answer your question on several months in, we're more excited about the capabilities of what is possible than we were even before and are even more intentional about the work that we need to do to bring these 3 priorities to life. If I were to paint a sort of general picture, I would say we'll probably be in a place in about a year where we're really seeing the impact of the momentum of these priorities as it relates to our outcomes and our results because we've inserted in Mailchimp some of our best product people that really understand QuickBooks, really understand this space that are building out the platform with, of course, the Mailchimp engineers, which are all part of Intuit. And we think getting this right and we know how to get it right, we think about a year or so, we'll start seeing the impact of the priorities that we are focused on. The good news is we know how to do it, and there's no surprises there. Yes. Great. Thank you for your question, Michael. I'll start with the latter one first. And I think it was really importantly stated it in your question. We have very powerful brands that our customers love and use, Mailchimp, TurboTax, Credit Karma and QuickBooks. And our intent is to really from a brand perspective, convey that they are connected and connected means that you get more benefit as a customer and the power of those benefits in really fueling your success as an individual or as a business. So all that means is the brands are powerful, the brands are not going to go away. It's about how we invest to make the connection in the minds of customers that this is all Intuit and by the way, here's why you should care. The second element around the campaigns, it's -- it's early, but we're actually -- and my comments specifically around TurboTax as I assume that's what you were asking about if it's broader, please come back and ask the other elements of your question. We're really pleased with our campaign so far this year. And our intent going in was to really communicate this year that we have experts that understand your situation. If you look at our campaigns, both on-air and digitally, you'll see things around communicating to those that are self-employed, communicating to those that have moved multiple states, communicating to those that have made investments in helping them understand no matter what your situation is, we have an expert that can help your situation. And we've invested heavily in not only who we bring on board, but also our AI capabilities, not only to make that perfect match but also to deliver insights to those experts to make them much more effective and productive so we can do things at scale. So the consideration, awareness and understanding of what we're trying to communicate, so far has been very well received. And then, of course, we'll know more as we go through season. That's about just our results, but we do a lot of mix -- marketing mix modeling work to understand what was effective, how can we improve our game going forward. And we did this across the company, but we'll better understand the impact with data. So far, the qualitatively and early data has been very positive. Thank you. Yes, Ken, great question. Let me just say it's twofold. One, we've gone in really big within TurboTax exposing TurboTax customers to Credit Karma where they can put their refund on a Credit Karma Money account, where they will get 5 days early access and really tax time, it's all about the money. And then these folks become new Credit Karma members and that we can expose them to the Credit Karma platform. We're really pleased with where that's going and the progress that we made. Of course, I won't share any stats with you, but we are -- I'll just leave it as we're very pleased. The second is last year, it almost wasn't even a trial year in Credit Karma. We sort of threw in TurboTax into the Credit Karma app. This year is really the first year where TurboTax, you can actually get your taxes done within the Credit Karma app. And for most cases, you don't actually have to go to TurboTax, which is a far, far better experience. We're getting wonderful learnings and adjusting real-time. We are, for the long term, really bullish about the -- not only all TurboTax customers using Credit Karma, but hopefully getting all Credit Karma members that already don't do their taxes with TurboTax, the BA TurboTax users. So, so far, we love what we're learning, the adjustments that we're making, and we continue to remain very bullish about just the whole prospect of why we're doing the integration between these 2 platforms and the impact that it's having for our members and TurboTax customers. Yes. Sure, Alex. Very good question. So first of all, I'll start with the obvious, which is overall, Small Business grew 24%. This is all excluding Mailchimp. And our Online Ecosystem revenue growth grew 37%. And as you know, our goal is to grow over 30%. So we actually had a extremely strong quarters. So I'm not sure what the sequential number is that you were throwing out there, but we had a very, very strong quarter, well above our 30% mark. And it's based on strength in volume and the mix of customers that are coming in and particularly the services that they are using across payments, payroll, time tracking and QuickBooks Capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to see strength in Small Business and Credit Karma in the second half of the year. We don't expect a tapering. And as I mentioned earlier, we just really want to get through tax season and talk about our guidance after the quarter. So I wouldn't read anything into the fact that Small Business is going to taper. I would say, focused on our compass, which is we want to grow north of 30% with our Online Ecosystem revenue and we actually are seeing great strength. Yes, Alex, the -- strategically, the biggest area that we've been focused on has been really integrating Credit Karma into the TurboTax experience and then vice versa. So what that means is if you're a TurboTax customer at the end, one of the first options that you get is to put your refund on a Credit Karma Money account. And as I mentioned a moment ago, that was a strategic thesis that we had, and it's going really well. And these become new Credit Karma members and then we can expose other benefits on the Credit Karma platform to those customers. The second is building out within the Credit Karma app the TurboTax experience and contextually engaging customers with helping them get their taxes done. And to say we're in the early days is interesting, right, because we're only a year in. We like the progress that we're seeing, and that's the area where we're more than doubling down because we're literally only a year-end, and there's just so much opportunity ahead of us, and we're actually seeing the green shoots. The other, Alex, is integrating Credit Karma as part of the payroll platform. So if you want to ultimately get earlier access to your money, you can put your money on a Credit Karma Money account, that's another area. But the primary focus has been creating this one consumer platform between TurboTax and Credit Karma. Yes, sure, Brent. As we always do, we have pricing principles, and we run a lot of tests, and there are multiple holistic things that we did in our lineup this year. And let me start with where you didn't ask the question because it's relevant to the overall answer to your question. One, for our free customers, we actually expanded it to include student loans for free and refund transfer for free. That was one very important decision that we made. When we looked at our TurboTax Live platform to continue to really accelerate bringing more customers into the category from prior assisted, we also, for simple filers, announce, you can do it anyway you wish, do it yourself or with a live platform for a certain time period and you pay nothing. And we like the progress and the impact that we're seeing there. The third is we ran a lot of tests for TurboTax Live and particularly full service and what we learned in some ways, unsurprisingly, is price is not a big factor. It's about confidence and access to an expertise. And what we realized is having early season pricing and then later season pricing didn't really have much of an impact. So one, there is no early or late season pricing. It's one flat pricing. And two, we had a lot of room to move up on pricing, and we made a decision based on a lot of testing to move the price up. So those were a few strategic decisions that we've made. And as we back-test our decisions, it's playing out exactly as we thought, which is these are not really that price-sensitive customers, although they love our price versus other alternatives. It's more, can I get access to the expert that I want? And can I get -- confidently have somebody to get my taxes done for me? And that's what we're seeing. Sure. I think I'll just say 2 things. One, these are resilient customers and they continue to love their Desktop products, and they always surprise us relative to wanting to come back to desktop. And really, that's a simple answer to your question on what we continue to see. I think the second thing that we're very excited about and so I would say our -- the majority of our customers is really moving to a subscription-based approach where they can leverage a lot of the services that we now create in the cloud, and that will drive even a higher subscription element of our business and it will also give our customers the ability to access more features and functionalities and that's something that we started rolling out this year and will be primarily subscription-based as we look into the future. Yes, Kartik, thanks for your question. If you recall, probably a couple of quarters ago, Michelle and I both talked about the fact that we expect a tapering of originations in the second half of the year, we would expect to continue to see strength because of our execution and because of Lightbox and the fact that we really deliver personalized experiences, which is good for members and good for partners, but we expect a tapering of origination. And we haven't seen the type of tapering that we thought we would see, which is why we continue to see the strength that we're experiencing and what we would expect in the second half of the year. Part of our playbook is, as a company is we do a lot of scenario planning customer back, and it's really primarily focused on making sure we're obsessed with our customers and what other alternatives could be presented to our customers that could be far more compelling. So just as part of our playbook, we do that quite well, and we particularly are probably one of the best at it across the company in tax. So just know that, that is part of our playbook. And I would just tell you that this year, we've probably been the least surprised. And so no, it is not -- there's no surprises that's informing anything differently that we're doing the rest of the season. Yes. Thanks, Brad. The very short answer is absolutely. We actually, believe it or not, feel the best this year than we have in prior years just because we've gotten so good at what we need to do. We're several years into this and because many experts actually want to be on our platform. So we are absolutely fine on hiring. All right. Excellent. Well, listen, everyone, thank you so much for all of your wonderful questions. Be safe out there. Take good care of yourselves, and we look forward to talking to you in May. Thank you, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Unfortunately, Michelle has lost her voice, so I will be reading her prepared remarks today. Sasan and I will take your questions during Q&A. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these prepared remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, up 70%, including 31 points from the addition of Mailchimp and Credit Karma, GAAP operating income of $56 million versus an operating loss of $25 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $612 million versus $235 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 versus $0.07 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55 versus $0.68 last year. After the quarter ended, we entered into an agreement that will resolve the majority of pending arbitration claims related to the Free File litigation without admitting any wrongdoing. This resulted in an immaterial charge reflected in our fiscal Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP results. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 47% during the quarter or 27% on an organic basis, excluding $240 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 74% or 37% excluding Mailchimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 35% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking grew 139% in fiscal Q2. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 39%. Mailchimp revenue recorded in online services was $240 million in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 226% in fiscal Q2 on a constant currency basis and 33% on an organic basis, excluding Mailchimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the second quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. As a reminder, this fall, we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect the desktop business to decline. Consumer Group revenue of $411 million grew 180% in Q2, reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. We are seeing a slower forming tax season taking into consideration both the earlier IRS open date this year and the latest IRS data. While still early in the season, our analysis shows we are on track to gain share overall, excluding users with the TurboTax free file offering in prior year periods. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2022. We continue to focus on our strategy to extend our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As a reminder, there are 4 key drivers of our Consumer Tax business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share and the fourth is average revenue per return.  Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 14% in Q2, also reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $444 million in Q2, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the quarter, we saw another record quarter driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals reflected momentum year-over-year in auto loans and home loans. And we are developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on April 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, including 26% to 28% revenue growth or 18% to 20% growth excluding Mailchimp. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 32% to 33%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.18 to $6.24 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.51 to $7.57. You can find our full Q3 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Mailchimp, the largest transaction in Intuit's history during the second quarter. We are working to finalize the purchase price accounting process, which could result in a onetime impact to our second quarter GAAP-only results and full year fiscal 2022 GAAP-only guidance we issued today. This process will not result in a change to the total consideration of the transaction. We expect to complete this process before we file our 10-Q. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. If I could add 2 things to that, Raimo, just to remind you of some things that were mentioned in the script, too. The big growth driver in the quarter was Desktop Enterprise, which grew low double digits in the second quarter, and that's up from high single digits in the first quarter. Similar to what Sasan mentioned, that was -- that specifically for the Desktop Enterprise with customer growth and price increases there. So really something to consider. That's the piece that's growing within that. And then longer term, we're not expecting this business to decline, especially headwinds from the subscription model transition in the second half of this year."

Thanks, Kim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start in fiscal year 2022 with continued momentum across the Company, given our strategy of becoming a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have nearly a $300 billion addressable market driven by digital tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. First quarter revenue grew 52%, including 32 points from the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by small business and self-employed group revenue growth of 22%, and Credit Karma revenue of $418 million, another record quarter. Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter.  As a result, both of our strong start to the year and the close of Mailchimp transaction, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings-per-share guidance for fiscal year 2022. Michelle will cover this in detail later. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets for solving the largest problems are customers states face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well-positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionized speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market.  Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. I am extremely proud of the momentum we are seeing with Credit Karma. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects, solving a two-sided problem. We are focused on our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets, and access financial experts and insights. Credit Karma achieved record high revenue again in Q1. We continue to deliver innovation across all verticals fueled by our proprietary Lightbox platform, enabling personalized experiences for our members, creating a network effect. Within the core, partners ' usage of Lightbox reached all-time highs across both credit cards and personal loans.  Lightbox more than doubled the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma. Within the growth verticals, we're solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers. Karma Drive is giving U.S. members the opportunity to see if they can save money on auto insurance with usage-based pricing. We're actively exploring expansion opportunities with Lightbox in other verticals, including auto loans, building off of the success as we've seen in credit cards and personal loans. Within the emerging verticals, we remain focused on innovation with Credit Karma money. We integrated Credit Karma money into TurboTax last season and experimented with how we could best meet our customers ' needs and announced an integration with QuickBooks Online Payroll.  Given our learnings, we are excited about launching our improved experiences in the upcoming tax season. We believe Credit Karma Money is the key to driving growth in frequency of visits over time, one of the many key drivers of average revenue per monthly active user. Zooming out, we continue to grow members and are focused on building trust by delivering personalized financial products right for members, helping members save money, pay down debt, and get faster access to their money while providing insight and advice. Over time, we're creating a virtual cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transaction, and monetization across our ecosystem.  Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggled with cash flow and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. In fiscal year 2021, total payments volume on our platform grew 40% year-over-year to over $90 billion. An online payment volume grew more than 60% driven by an increase in customer using our payments offering. As we continue to innovate for our customers and payments, those using QuickBooks cash of nearly 3 times higher engagement compared to customers who've just used QuickBooks Online. To accelerate engagement and usage of our platform, we recently introduced Get Paid Upfront, a game - changing innovation that will help qualified customers get paid soon after their invoice is set.  Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advance. We're seeing strong traction with QBO Advance, with customers growing to 118,000 in fiscal year 2021, up 57% year-over-year. As we continue to move up-market and serve these customers most critical needs, we're seeing a services ecosystem ARPC that is 4x higher than the ARPC for QBO customers. We're pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plans to win. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. This will be further fueled the by Mailchimp. I'm delighted that we closed Mailchimp.  They closed the acquisition earlier this month, which seeks to significantly accelerate 2 of our Big Bets, bet: to be the center of small business growth, and to disrupt the small business mid-market. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant paying-point for small and mid-market businesses. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First priority is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform to help customers get their business online, market their business, manage their customers ' relationships, get paid, access capital, pay employees, manage cash flow, and be compliant with virtual experts at their fingertips, all in one place. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM, and e-commerce suite for mid-market customers at an attractive price point, enabling mid-market customers to use the power of the platform to grow their business.  And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. With Mailchimp now part of the Intuit family, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses to combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. This is where the real magic happens. Our combined platform technology enables us to move with speed, and we've already seen strong interest from our customers. The teams are hard at work, and we are excited about the opportunity ahead. Foundational to our Company's success is building a high-performance culture. I want to take a moment to acknowledge our progress with our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.  Last year, we declared our focus on increasing the percentages of women in technology roles and underrepresented minorities across our business. We achieved 30% and 13% respectively and we are inspired to accelerate our plans and push even harder as much work remains to be done. Additionally, we've made meaningful progress supporting our communities. First, we recently announced the Intuit Climate Action Marketplace, which will help 1 million U.S. small businesses find sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions. This is part of our decade-long climate positive goal to go beyond net carbon neutral and reduce global carbon emissions by 2 million metric tons by 2030, or 50 times greater than our 2018 operational footprint. We also recently announced a 23-year partnership with the Los Angeles Clippers that includes economic benefits for the local community with Intuit Dome, the team's future home.  And finally, we launched Intuit Ventures to invest in the startup community and accelerate FinTech innovation for consumers and small businesses. All the work we do starts with our mission of powering prosperity around the world. And I'm proud of the momentum across the Company and delivering on that mission for our customers and communities. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. And I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. Now, let me turn to the results. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion, GAAP operating income of a $195 million versus $209 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $555 million versus $334 million last year, GAAP-diluted earnings per-share of $0.82 versus $0.75 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.53 versus $0.94 last year. Note that our GAAP results include a $39 million net gain on other long-term investments. Turning to the business segments; in the small business and self-employed group, revenue grew 22% during the quarter, with online ecosystem revenue up 36%. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within small business and self-employed is three-fold, grow the Core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the Core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem.  Online services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, capital, and time-tracking, grew 42% in fiscal Q1. Within Payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in Payroll customers, and the mix shift to our full-service offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of online ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 39% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter.  QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high-single digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases we put in place late last year. As a reminder, this fall we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's Desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. We expect the Desktop business to decline longer-term. Moving onto Credit Karma, revenue was $480 million in Q1, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the core, we saw another record quarter, driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals also achieved another strong quarter, reflecting momentum in home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma money, part of our digital money offering, so this is not a large revenue driver today. We continue to expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in the second half of fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue of $120 million in Q1 was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As to the ProConnect Group, revenue of $26 million in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform.  These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On November 1st, we entered into a $4.7 billion term loan under our new credit arrangement at credit agreement to partially fund the Mailchimp acquisition. We repurchased $339 million during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable January 18th, 2022.  This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance to reflect both the acquisition of Mailchimp and the stronger than expected start to the year in the small business and self-employed group and Credit Karma. Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue up $12.165 billion to $12.3 billion, growth of 26% to 28%, including Mailchimp as of November 1st and a full-year of Credit Karma. Excluding Mailchimp, revenue grows of 18% to 20% up from our prior guidance of 15% to 16%, GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.16, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.48 to $11.64.  This updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes organic growth for the small business and self-employed segment of 16% to 17%, up from 12% to 14%, expected Mailchimp revenue of $760 million to $770 million, and Credit Karma revenue of $1.54 billion to $1.565 billion, up from $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion. As I shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. Excluding Mailchimp, our non-GAAP operating income guidance continues to imply approximately 60 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2022. Our guidance assumes the Mailchimp transaction is accretive to Intuit 's non-GAAP earnings per share in full-year fiscal 2022.  However, we expect an approximate 80 basis points onetime step-down in non-GAAP operating margin reflecting the impact of Mailchimp as we plan to invest aggressively in the business. We expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion to continue from this new level over time in line with our financial principles. Our fiscal 2020 GAAP operating income guidance includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation associated with the acquisition of Mailchimp.  In addition, our GAAP operating income guidance includes the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we are making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We're confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. And we expect a GAAP tax rate of 18% in fiscal 2022. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 73% to 74%. GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.88. You can find our full Q2 and updated fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. We are off to a strong start this year with continued momentum across the Company, given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that's powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what our employees have accomplished this quarter and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers. Now let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim. Your question, please.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you so much. Sasan, the success of Lightbox has been very impressive. Just wondering, is there a way to quantify where we are in terms of adoption of Lightbox within that your core credit vertical and what that potential adoption could look like? And then you touched on expanding into other verticals. What verticals do you think are appropriate to integrate into Lightbox?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Ken, thanks for the question. In terms of Lightbox, as we talked about it at Investor Day, we've actually made significant progress year-over-year in terms of penetration. I think what we talked about at Investor Day is we had 50% and 40% penetration in credit cards and personal loans compared to, I think, 40, 20 a year before. One, we have significant penetration opportunity ahead of us. I think equally as important, if not more, is what financial institutions are seeing, which is really the payoff for their investments. And so, more and more financial institutions are joining the platform and this gives us, really, an opportunity to significantly increase penetration.  I think that's the way I would probably give you the punch line. Our penetration in credit cards is, I think, less than 5%, just as an example, and personal loans and other verticals are even lower than that. So, Lightbox, the trust we build with our members, the trust we are building with our partners gives us an opportunity for significant penetration, and I think are sort of best years are ahead of us when you think about Lightbox and particularly a penetration. In terms of your question around expansion, auto loans are just one example of where we can expand Lightbox and there are other areas that we've not talked about publicly. I won't do it today until we see our further proof points where we can further expand Lightbox. I think this is 13 years of investments that now positions us to really deliver for members, partners, and really create this network effect.\nKen Wong: Got it. Fantastic. Appreciate the color. And then, if I could sneak one in for you, Michelle. When I look at that Mailchimp number 760, 770, any way to help us understand what that growth might have looked like on a three-quarter basis versus last year?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hi, Ken. Yeah. We're really excited about Mailchimp. And we think that we're going to do some great things together. Their revenue and their new paying user growth were negatively impacted during the pandemic. I would let to know that. And they did pull back on some of their marketing spend so they could preserve their profitability, and we did see their churn decline some there too. We're going to be investing aggressively to drive their growth as we go forward. It won't happen overnight, but we're really excited about the opportunities we see to grow as we look forward. We haven't really given any additional details on what their growth was previously.\nKen Wong: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much, Michelle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and really impressive quarter across the board. It is -- there's really nothing to pick on in here. I wanted to dig into the QuickBooks Online business a little bit. Both sort of the subscriptions and the online services boasting acceleration in the quarter. Can you help us understand how much of that is the continued reflation post the calendar '20 macro impacts, and how much comes from just fundamentally improving attach rates? I know you guys are focusing on higher level customers with QBO Advanced. Is that starting to improve your overall attach rate picture in that business?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Keith, thanks for the question. I would say the majority, if not all, compared to previous quarters, is simply customer growth. Its improved mix based on the traction of QuickBooks Advance, QuickBooks Live to a lesser degree, and things like full-service Payroll, and just all the innovation we've been doing in payments with instant deposit making it easier to use our payments offering, and now our new launch with Get Paid Upfront. So, I would say the majority of what we're starting to experience is the actual innovation on the platform and the portfolio that we have solving a broad range of needs for our customers. I would say bounce back from the pandemic, of course, happened and we started experiencing the pickup, but that was, I would say, 4 to 6 months ago. I think now we're seeing the actual true performance of the platform.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. And then maybe a follow-up from Michelle. You called out again the potential impacts on the Desktop business from a shift towards subscription. Any way you can help us quantify what those impacts are going to be?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Hey, Keith. What I can tell you about Desktop is, obviously, we saw the 7% growth in the Ecosystem in first quarter. And that was really driven by 2 different components. The majority of it was 2 components. First was we saw higher Desktop Enterprise customer growth and some price increases. Desktop Enterprise revenue growth was high single-digits in Q1. The other half of that is really the Desktop subscriber mix. Last year, what we saw was Desktop subs grew 48%, and outright units declined by 47%. And so, that growth in subs last year, because of the way we do revenue recognition, you get an extra pop of revenue from subscriber growth in the -- in Q1. And so that is what we saw. We do expect to see some headwinds for that growth as we go further out through the rest of the year, especially with all the subscriber growth instead of an outright.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. All right. Thank you, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nChirag Ved: Hi, this is Chirag Ved on for Kirk. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the great quarter. I know it's still early days, but can you talk a little bit about the plan for the go-to most -- go-to-market with Mailchimp? For example, are you planning to approach customers or the one-stop shop vendor or do you think both will be filled separately given potential different buying centers and companies? Does Mailchimp expedite your plans to potentially expand QuickBooks into more geographies on a quicker timeline? And I guess how do you expect this to evolve over time as we reached steady-state.? Thanks so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll take you back to the 3 priorities that we've declared because I think it goes after the great question that you've asked. First and foremost, our number one priority is really around creating one growth platform, and it's really a lot of the work behind the scenes in terms of building data pipelines and connecting the services so that the magical power of the data, both Mailchimp data and QuickBooks data can come together for the customer to put the power of the insights in their hands. So first and foremost, it's all about the product and creating one growth platform. The second is we see a huge opportunity to serve mid-market. As you know, we're already doing that from a financial management solutions perspective with QuickBooks Advance.  Now we're going to, in essence, build out the capabilities on Mailchimp and really disrupt the mid-market because this is a huge need for mid-market. And I would say third is actually having a global playbook and investing -- accelerating our investments in go-to-market, which I think will get at the last question that you asked that I didn't answer yet, and that is we want customers to have choice. So, if customers first want to engage with Mailchimp to be able to take their business online, to market their business and use CRM tools, they can use Mailchimp and -- but we'll make sure everything is payment-enabled. And then over time, if they want to use all of the invoicing capabilities, payroll capabilities, access to capital, ensure that they're compliant, all of that will be enabled within Mailchimp.  The vice versa is true. If you're using QuickBooks and you want to start using capabilities to market your business and manage your customers, all the capabilities of Mailchimp will be available to you, and Mailchimp could end up being, for instance, a nab item on the left-hand side. So, we will let customers make choice is, I think, the headline answer to your question. We will go to market separately. We will go to market together. We will raise awareness and ensure that customers know that there is one place where they can run their business, and more importantly, the power of all their data will be in one place to fuel their success. That's the approach that we're taking.\nChirag Ved: All right, thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nGreg Jackson: Great, thanks. Hey, it's Greg Jackson on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one is actually on the better-than-expected performance for the remainder of the year from Credit Karma. And we're curious, is this -- I mean, is it driven more by a stronger bounce-back from an impact in 2020 in your traditional verticals, or is it more about having increased confidence, Michelle? And I think what you mentioned on the home and auto loans side.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for the question. A couple of things I would start with. Last year, when you look at the full year of Credit Karma compared to the prior year, we grew 37%. And our new guidance for Credit Karma going forward is a range of 35% to 37%. And so, I think what you see within that is there has been a macro bounce back. But really a lot of what we're really seeing is the innovation on the platform, the power of Lightbox, the fact that members are getting better matches to things that they are looking for. Financial institutions are \u2013 and insurance companies are seeing the power of the platform.  And it's really just creating that network effect. So, I think what we're gaining confidence in is just the innovation, the technology investments in Lightbox, and in context of the macro environment as we look ahead that gives us confidence around the performance of Credit Karma. And again, I would just remind us that this is more of a longer-term comment. Credit Karma is a platform, and we're creating an ecosystem effect here. Credit Karma is part of the TurboTax experience, and we're excited for all of you to see what we're going to be launching in the coming tax season. TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma experience. Credit Karma is part of the payroll experience. So really think about Intuit as 1 platform with many platforms that solves different problems, and that's really what fuels our confidence as we look ahead.\nGreg Jackson: Okay, great. And then a follow-up, actually, on the tax business. And by the end of the second quarter, we'll be into the tax season. So, this is -- we're coming up on marketing time on TurboTax advertisement spent. So, any color that you can give us on what plans are for the marketing budget as we ramp up into January?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Well, I'm not going to talk about the marketing budget, but what I will share with you is it's very consistent and durable in context of what you've seen in the last couple of years. We are very focused on really fundamentally changing how you get your taxes done if you need assistance. And you're going to continue to see us be assertive in terms of how we raise awareness with 88 million customers that need assistance and how there's a better way to get your assistance. And also, the under-penetrated segments that we've talked about, which is Latinx, the investment community, and the self-employed. I think you can -- what you should expect is our investments on a platform has continued in those areas. We're really excited about the season coming up, and our marketing efforts will be really focused in those areas to continue to raise awareness.\nGreg Jackson: All right, great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome\nOperator: Thank You. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Congratulations. Great quarter. Sasan, I want to ask you about the new business, I mean, new customer acquisition trend that you are seeing. I remember you talked about lagging effect to new business creation in the U.S. So, wondering what's trend you're seeing on the QuickBooks new customer acquisition site, and what promotion or anything you are doing at this point?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for your kind comments and the question. I would say that it's very consistent with what we talked to you all about at Investor Day, and that is that we're continuing to see the acquisition trends that we would expect in the U.S. across-the-board, both in the low-end of the market but also the trends that we're seeing in the mid-market, so those trends continue. And as we've shared before, we're not overly reliant by any means on new business formations. From just a health perspective, I would say the U.S. is consistent with what we talked about with all of you a few months ago.  And I would say outside of the U.S., again, very consistent with what before, the recovery has not been like the U.S. Now, if I were to double-click on that, I would say behind the U.S. has been Canada. And I think we're going to start seeing UK and Australia start to come back. Sorry, UK and France. And then Australia is, I would say behind UK and France. We do believe that in the next year or less, that international will start to slowly bounce back.  And the reason for just the slowness in international bouncing back is there's just been so many starts and stops those small businesses that just lost confidence. Do I build up inventory? Do I go hire more employees? Do I increase my own marketing budget? That they've just been slower in bouncing back. But we believe, within the next year or so, we'll see that strength. But the headline news is U.S. continues to be strong and match what we've expected, and international role will bounce back within a year.\nSiti Panigrahi: That's great. And a follow-up to TurboTax question, this is probably the first year you are going to tap into the Credit Karma members who are not using TurboTax. Do you see as -- what strategy do you have at this point to tap into such a massive member base in Credit Karma?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. We are really excited about just the possibilities of what we can do for members -- Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. Last year really was a learning year and I think we're going to learn a lot more this year. Listen, our goal is we want every TurboTax customer to be using Credit Karma and all the benefits of Credit Karma, and we want every Credit Karma member to be using TurboTax, whether they want to do it themselves or they need assistance. I think we're going to be one year better than we were last year in terms of all of our experiences, in terms of just the investments that we've made and the experiences, and we're excited about it. But just to put it in context, at Investor Day, we shared with you our Horizon framework. Horizon 1 being sort of revenue impact within 0 months to 18 months, Horizon 2 being 18 months to 36 months, and Horizon 3 being 36 months plus. We actually put the impact of Credit Karma integrated as part of TurboTax and vice versa is almost 3 years out because we really want to nail the experience. But nevertheless, we're leaning in and we're excited about the things we're going to be launching in the weeks to come.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey there. Thank you, and congrats on the amazing results to start off the fiscal year. We've talked about it. I mean, you've gotten a few questions on tax. We see this on the live technology, we see you're now offering expert setup for QuickBooks as well. So, wondering if you can just add any color on how far that expert led vision extends. Is that something you could take to consumer finance or potentially even something like email marketing with Mailchimp? It seems like a powerful addition to the product portfolio, and clearly a big bet you've been focused on. So, I'd love to hear more. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Michael. Thank you for your kind words, and great question. When we declared our bet around connecting people to experts and creating our virtual expert platform, we have been, I think we're onto now, I don't know 5 plus years, really investing in this virtual expert platform. There are so many underlying technologies, services where AI is being used to ensure that the platform matches the right customer to the right experts, to make the platform simple and easy-to-use for experts and we feel really confident relative to just the where we are with the virtual expert platform, and our focus, intentionally, has been really about serving customers when it comes to tax time and helping small businesses with the bookkeeping and eventually also with their taxes. But more importantly, just helping them run their business.  And we have so much opportunity ahead of us just in that space. With that said, we do have a few, what we call small mission-based genes that are exploring other spaces because we can leverage a lot of the capabilities of this virtual expert platform to serve spaces like marketing, potentially spaces like financial services. So, we are doing experiments but very intentionally to ensure that we can learn. I think I will just end with the opportunities of where we can take this virtual expert platform is endless. However, the biggest growth opportunity ahead of us right now is helping customers with taxes and helping small businesses run their business. And then as these other -- our verticals become reality, we'll, of course, share our plans with all of you. But it is something that will extend over time horizontally, continue verticals.\nMichael Turrin: That's a great answer. Michelle, you've historically not updated guidance before tax season. We've talked about some of the pockets of strength of Credit Karma. But in terms of breaking that historical pattern, are we just seeing a more diversified Intuit come through, or any comments you can provide just around the change there? Thank you.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Yes. This is something that diverges from what we have done historically. Historically, also, the Consumer Group has been such a large percentage of our business also. And now if we're adding -- Other parts of the business are growing more. We're adding Credit Karma. And overall, the composition of the business is just changing. Ans also, this is the one of the first times we've seen a real pandemic hit like this. And so, the growth after the pandemic has also had some implications for recovery and so forth. So yes, it is a little bit different, composition of the Company is a little different, but we feel really good about what we're seeing, and are very excited about the accelerated growth we're seeing in Credit Karma and in small business, and ready to jump into tax season.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats, guys. My question. You had a price increase go into effect during the quarter in small business. Any discernible impact to retention across your various skews, particularly from those who haven't attached payments or payroll?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Brad. Thank you for your kind words and the question. I would -- I'll say 2 things. 1. Really the majority of our growth continues to come from customer growth and mix in a much lesser extent price so you should just be aware of that, and 2. There's nothing that we've seen from the price increase that's outside of the balance of what we expected. So, the short answer is no. It's within our control limit as we expected it based on the testing that we had done.\nBrad Zelnick: Got it. And if I could just follow-up with one more, Sasan. There's no doubt a significant opportunity with Credit Karma money, and I believe you called out the opportunity for QuickBooks Payroll customers to deposit up to $232 billion of payroll funds into a CK money account. What traction have you seen on this so far, or what percentage of QuickBooks Payroll payees do you think you can ultimately capture with something like this?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, you know the -- well, first of all, we've not divulged our traction other than I would tell you. We generally are excited. As part of many things that we are providing in our portfolio to customers, giving them early access to wages, I think a lot of what we are learning and a lot of what we're excited about as we move forward. It depends on the customer and the cohort of customers. There are certain customers that depending on their situation and how much they depend on living weekly -- connected to their weekly paycheck.  If you live paycheck to paycheck, you are much more focused on can I get early access to that versus if you don't live week-to-week. So, we're learning about those cohorts within our payroll to your question and where we can get traction and where it's just not a need for customers. I would say more broadly, we are excited about early access to wages both providing it across payroll standalone, providing it through Credit Karma. And frankly I think over time this is just something that's going to be commodity. I think everybody is going to have a product feature that gives you early access to the wages. For us it's not just about the feature, it's about the ecosystem effect that it creates for our customers and our members.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome. Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your question, please.\nBrent Thill: Sasan, you were clear when the Mailchimp deal closed that this is not just a mail Company, that there was a broader platform play for marketing and selling up a website. I'm just curious along that theme. What you're seeing in terms of the most excitement where you can bring Mailchimp into your clients and ultimately this platform plays for the front office and how that evolves. If you could cover that, that'd be great.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, absolutely, Brent. One of the things that we -- one of our mechanisms that we have as a Company is called our Big Bet review, where we take our officers of the Company through the experiences of each of the Big Bets to what we've learned, where we are, and where we're headed. And this is the last Big Bet review happened to be one where we brought in Ben as a team from Mailchimp, and actually walked through the experience in detail, where we are, and where we're going. And I would just tell you that we continue to even get more excited as we've closed the deal because the needs of our customers are in all the areas that you mentioned. They are -- and every customer it's in a different place, but customers are really looking for ways to be able to engage, getting new customers.  It's their bread and butter. Almost 70% of our customers are looking for ways to get new customers. We now have those capabilities and we'll integrate it into QuickBooks and vice versa, QuickBooks into Mailchimp. They want to be able to manage their existing customers in an automated way, in an insightful way where everything is automated. They don't have to know when do I follow up with a customer, what additional products can I sell them. All of that can get automated through Mailchimp. And one of the things people don't realize is one of the largest ways that you still engage customers, we see it through what we do in TurboTax, is actually email. So now we have all those capabilities.  We have abilities to put you on mega platforms with all of our digital assets, manage all of your existing relationships, all the email capabilities, but more importantly, it's the leveraging the power of the data, the customer data, and the purchase data to help you understand who is the customer, who bought what, what did they not buy, who's leading your shopping card, and how do you pursue them. It's consistent with what we've talked about before. That's the opportunity ahead, and that's about the work that we do now on the product to put the power of those capabilities in the hands of our customers. We couldn't be more excited to help our customers with their success. So, stay tuned.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, good afternoon or good evening, Sasan. I wanted to ask you a little bit about TurboTax Live, maybe what the trends have been in terms of customers that are already TurboTax customers shifting to that product and new customers, and how you anticipate that trend evolving this tax season.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, it's a great question. It's one thing that's just really excites us about the Live platform. 1. There's 88 million folks that use an assisted method today. Within the assisted method, you have 10 million folks every year where there's churn, they go -- jump from one assisted method to another. So, from 1 accountant to another or from 1 store to an accountant. And then within the TurboTax base, the do-it yourself or as we have 4 million people that leave, and they ultimately go to an assisted method. I think that the answer to your question is it's all the above. We've seen conversion improvements, retention improvements.  We've seen TurboTax customers that did it themselves a year before where they had a life change, or they just weren't sure if they did their home deductions the right way or if they had a kid and the kid went to college, how that ultimately account for those deductions where they are now using the live platform and vice versa. You may use the life platform and I've enough confidence with the year after, you do it yourself and then you may then after that bounce back and now we're seeing 3, 4 years of trends. Really, it's all of the above with the largest, I would say, driver being folks that use a different assisted method coming onto a platform and, of course, those that have life changes within TurboTax, growing with TurboTax, and using the live platform. And we just see that continuing as we view this opportunity with a 10-year lens.\nKartik Mehta: And just a question on Credit Karma. Sasan, you've talked about Credit Karma money and that sounds like a very interesting opportunity. I'm wondering, is there any concern that your customer says, hey, you're competing with me now for deposits and that causes issues?\nSasan Goodarzi: One of the sorts of essential strategic principles that we have within Credit Karma is that it is an agnostic platform. And our financial institutions and all our partners see the power of that, how diligent and intentional we are about not creating our own products, but ensuring that we match members with a product that's right for them. And a lot of the capabilities that we have within Credit Karma ultimately had an institution that's participating in it. So that is not a concern that we have. Our say due is very, very high with financial institutions and we just believe that that's the beginning of it, especially with attraction of Lightbox which actually delivers more success for members and more success for financial institutions. So, it is not a concern of ours.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Fantastic quarter, Sasan and Michael. Sasan, I'm curious to get your take on the issues that are facing -- that are being faced by the U.S. economy. You've got unprecedented labor shortage, got a supply chain issue, got an inflation issue. A lot of these problems do pertain to the small business ecosystem. When you think of Intuit and the dramatic transformation you've undertaken very successfully, but betting on AI, what can Intuit do to solve these problems for small business customers as it plays to these near-term headwinds that we're facing from your product perspective? Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Kash, thank you, 1, for your kind comment and it's a wonderful question on all those areas, the labor shortage, some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business, and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I would make a broad comment that I would say we are experiencing. When you couple what happened with the pandemic starting in March of 2020, where it really, I think, forced everyone around the globe, whether you're a small business or not, but let's stay focused on small businesses to reinvent yourself. And it really accelerated the shift to virtual solutions.  It accelerated the shift to going online whether it's how you invoice get paid, how you do your payroll, how you do your time tracking. And I think that movement which is just simply continuing, I don't think wherever going to go back to the old way. I think this pandemic really has accelerated the shift in those areas that I mentioned, in particular to, of course, to digital money offering. I think that coupled with this not only labor shortage but also labor movements from job to job, some of the supply chain challenges that generally we believe as I talked to my peers will get -- start to get addressed by the second half of 2022, first half of 2023, an inflation is actually causing small businesses to leverage more platforms.  And so, if I then bring that back to our platform and the fact that if you use our platform, you can get paid upfront, you can get instant deposit, you can do same-day payroll, you can use an expert to ensure that you've got the best deductions as a small business and to ensure that you're running your business effectively, and the fact that you can do more with less people if you use one platform. That's where the power of Mailchimp comes into play, rather than having multiple tools where you're bouncing back and forth between tools and you're not really sure what your customer profitability is, when you should follow up with the customer, how to acquire more customers.  All of those things are thrust to the use of our platform, and our platform is actually built to help you grow your business with less focus on labor and to be able to embrace as much as possible the inflation. Now, ultimately, we have to address overtime, and I believe it will get address some of these supply chain issues and inflationary issues. But that's where our platform comes into play and why we are so well-positioned for small businesses, and the role we need to play to continue to educate them.\nKash Rangan: Excellent. Thank you so much. Quick 1 for Michelle. How do you assist of the long-term margin drivers, and generally, discreet things that margin growth is somewhat linear, but generally these things tend to go up in an S-curve, so we often underestimate the true profitably of companies in the long term? In your case, what are the things that we should be looking for that could drive increased operating leverage in the future? Thank you so much and congrats.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thank you, Kash. Appreciate that. Well, in the current year, as I spoke about earlier, we will see a margin adjustment with the acquisition of Mailchimp and so we do though believe that over time, we will continue to expand our margins as we've talked about from this new step-down level going forward. But as we become more and more of a platform, we see opportunities for us just across the Company, whether it is in technology and being able to increase the velocity of development on our platform and driving more services, using things like money movement across the Company, and our fraud and risk capabilities not having to duplicate those across the Company. Or in customer success is another great example, where we're scaling a common customer success platform so that we can more efficiently and effectively serve customers. And then also in the go-to-market area, really leveraging a common infrastructure to be able to more effectively target customers, manage our sales and marketing processes also. So, we do see a number of opportunities all across the P&L that as we look forward, there will be opportunities for us to leverage this.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Brilliant. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills, Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks, guys. I'll likely to congratulations on a real nice quarter. I wanted to ask a question about TurboTax if I might, please. With this being the second year of your targeting the full-service opportunity, what were the learnings from the last year, your first year with this offering? Historically, you've seen this 1% to 2% share gain within Do-It-Yourself. Do-It-Yourself has gained 2 to 4 points as a category. Could this potentially accelerate those trends as you gain more intelligence to become more successful with this effort? And just generally, what are your expectations for this year with that offering?\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Brad. I would say 2 big things. One is a full service absolutely has a halo impact on confidence for the customer which actually gets me to the second point, and really the approach which is, we're a platform for our customers and so really if you think customer [Indiscernible], we want our customers to know that they have the ability to do it themselves. They can access an expert, if they need the expert to answer any questions that they have, and/or they can just have you -- us do their taxes for them and do everything digitally.  By the way, midstream if you choose an expert and utilize, you know what? I don't know if I just want to help, I just want to Intuit to do it all for me, we'll do it all for you. So really our approach and now that we've had several years of experimenting and learning with full service is that now we have a true end-to-end platform where we can meet the needs of any customer, and the power has actually grown with customers over time. If they just start out their career or if they're students who they have life change, we have a platform that will meet all of their needs. So that's really the, I would say the headlines of the answers plays a halo effect, which has informed our platform approach as we look ahead.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear, Sasan. One more if I may, please, just on Credit Karma. Last year, you saw nice upside and the tax quarters are converting TurboTax filers to Credit Karma. Could you remind us where you are there? With that some low-hanging fruit initially, what drove that success that you saw in that business, and what is your outlook for that this year and going forward? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. I would really put last year entirely in the bucket of just learning. And it doesn't mean that's going to change this year. We are a Company that's all about moving fast, experimenting, pivoting, and learning all in context of being stubborn around the vision that we have. Last year was a learning year, although there were some nice member growth impacts to Credit Karma from TurboTax. We're really excited and eager to see how our new innovations and experiences on the platform plays out this year and to see what we learned.  I'll take you back to the reason at Investor Day we put the opportunity of Credit Karma is part of TurboTax experience, and TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma platform as a Horizon 3, is we're really focused on the customer and member experience in nailing that because we know over time we can monetize. So, we're excited about the year ahead. Look, we have 11 months under our belt, learning and adjusting and preparing for this tax season. And we're excited about these experiences being launched and seeing how they play out in the next couple of months.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. First question. In international, Sasan, 39% growth in small business is very nice. Could you just give a little summary of what you saw and where in the quarter, and then part B to the question is you mentioned Mailchimp will --should accelerate global growth. I'm just curious when and how we'll see it showing up in the category. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thank you. First up on international, we saw some of the same trend given our, not only our execution but the macro environment as we've seen the last couple of quarters. There are certain countries like Canada that have bounced back a bit more strongly. Then there's places like Australia that really have been very slow to bounce back based on the fact that the economy keeps opening and shutting down. And again, our view is within the next year, international should start to come back from a macro perspective.  So, net-net, our trends in our performance, although we're very pleased with that, we believe over time to paint the different picture as the macro environment comes back. In terms of Mailchimp, our focus is the 3 priorities that I mentioned. We want to create an amazing product and platform that brings QuickBooks and Mailchimp together. We want to build the capabilities to go disrupt mid-market.  And then, as Michelle mentioned, we're going to be investing heavily in our global go-to-market. I would say I wouldn't overly anticipate a significant change in our trajectory international because of Mailchimp where there's some fundamental things, we want to get right to ensure that we can truly be the platform that -- where you can grow your business and run your business and over time it will certainly have an impact internationally and we're excited about that because it gives us another foot in the door outside of the U.S.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks. And just for our last one. Congratulations on the Intuit Dome. I'm just curious -- and maybe beat now crypto.com on that one. But just curious on the overriding big somatic marketing push of the Company in the last few years. How should we think about that on the big scale? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: I would say, and I've said this for years, and I think you're used to hear Brad talk about this. I think where the world's biggest hidden secret, and we don't want that secret to hold true anymore. We want to make sure the world knows who Intuit is and what our brands are. And we have data that shows that the more customers learn that TurboTax, Credit Karma, Mailchimp now, and QuickBooks when they learn that they're part of the Intuit brand and the platforms are all connected, it actually has a positive impact on our potential for growth. So, the way we think about Intuit Dome, it is not, for us, a naming rights deal.  We've had many opportunities where we've actually been pursued to be part of deals like this and we pass them up over the years. We did this because one, it's very technology forward dome. We're going to be helping the community. And 2. We're really going to be able to showcase our brands. And it will be yet another way to demonstrate the benefits that we bring to the market as one Intuit platform and the impact that we can have in the lives of consumers and small businesses. That's really how we think about it and why we're excited about it. And by the way, over time, we expected the same return on investment as we do with our marketing investments and that's really what this is. It just goes beyond marketing to impacting the local communities in LA, which we're excited about.\nScott Schneeberger: Excellent. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Thank you. Well, first of all, I really appreciate all the questions. And once again, I want to just thank our employees for their incredible hard work, our customers and our partners for the strong start to the year, and the opportunity we have ahead of us. We're very passionate about fundamentally powering the prosperity of our customers and communities, and we're proud of our accomplishments, and we continue to believe that we are just getting started. Thanks for your question, Thanks for your time, and we will see you at our next earnings call. Bye, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. And I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. Now, let me turn to the results. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion, GAAP operating income of a $195 million versus $209 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $555 million versus $334 million last year, GAAP-diluted earnings per-share of $0.82 versus $0.75 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.53 versus $0.94 last year. Note that our GAAP results include a $39 million net gain on other long-term investments. Turning to the business segments; in the small business and self-employed group, revenue grew 22% during the quarter, with online ecosystem revenue up 36%. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within small business and self-employed is three-fold, grow the Core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the Core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem.  Online services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, capital, and time-tracking, grew 42% in fiscal Q1. Within Payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in Payroll customers, and the mix shift to our full-service offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of online ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 39% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter.  QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high-single digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases we put in place late last year. As a reminder, this fall we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's Desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. We expect the Desktop business to decline longer-term. Moving onto Credit Karma, revenue was $480 million in Q1, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the core, we saw another record quarter, driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals also achieved another strong quarter, reflecting momentum in home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma money, part of our digital money offering, so this is not a large revenue driver today. We continue to expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in the second half of fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue of $120 million in Q1 was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As to the ProConnect Group, revenue of $26 million in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform.  These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On November 1st, we entered into a $4.7 billion term loan under our new credit arrangement at credit agreement to partially fund the Mailchimp acquisition. We repurchased $339 million during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable January 18th, 2022.  This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance to reflect both the acquisition of Mailchimp and the stronger than expected start to the year in the small business and self-employed group and Credit Karma. Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue up $12.165 billion to $12.3 billion, growth of 26% to 28%, including Mailchimp as of November 1st and a full-year of Credit Karma. Excluding Mailchimp, revenue grows of 18% to 20% up from our prior guidance of 15% to 16%, GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.16, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.48 to $11.64.  This updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes organic growth for the small business and self-employed segment of 16% to 17%, up from 12% to 14%, expected Mailchimp revenue of $760 million to $770 million, and Credit Karma revenue of $1.54 billion to $1.565 billion, up from $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion. As I shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. Excluding Mailchimp, our non-GAAP operating income guidance continues to imply approximately 60 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2022. Our guidance assumes the Mailchimp transaction is accretive to Intuit 's non-GAAP earnings per share in full-year fiscal 2022.  However, we expect an approximate 80 basis points onetime step-down in non-GAAP operating margin reflecting the impact of Mailchimp as we plan to invest aggressively in the business. We expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion to continue from this new level over time in line with our financial principles. Our fiscal 2020 GAAP operating income guidance includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation associated with the acquisition of Mailchimp.  In addition, our GAAP operating income guidance includes the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we are making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We're confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. And we expect a GAAP tax rate of 18% in fiscal 2022. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 73% to 74%. GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.88. You can find our full Q2 and updated fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Sasan. Hi, Ken. Yeah. We're really excited about Mailchimp. And we think that we're going to do some great things together. Their revenue and their new paying user growth were negatively impacted during the pandemic. I would let to know that. And they did pull back on some of their marketing spend so they could preserve their profitability, and we did see their churn decline some there too. We're going to be investing aggressively to drive their growth as we go forward. It won't happen overnight, but we're really excited about the opportunities we see to grow as we look forward. We haven't really given any additional details on what their growth was previously. Hey, Keith. What I can tell you about Desktop is, obviously, we saw the 7% growth in the Ecosystem in first quarter. And that was really driven by 2 different components. The majority of it was 2 components. First was we saw higher Desktop Enterprise customer growth and some price increases. Desktop Enterprise revenue growth was high single-digits in Q1. The other half of that is really the Desktop subscriber mix. Last year, what we saw was Desktop subs grew 48%, and outright units declined by 47%. And so, that growth in subs last year, because of the way we do revenue recognition, you get an extra pop of revenue from subscriber growth in the -- in Q1. And so that is what we saw. We do expect to see some headwinds for that growth as we go further out through the rest of the year, especially with all the subscriber growth instead of an outright. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Yes. This is something that diverges from what we have done historically. Historically, also, the Consumer Group has been such a large percentage of our business also. And now if we're adding -- Other parts of the business are growing more. We're adding Credit Karma. And overall, the composition of the business is just changing. Ans also, this is the one of the first times we've seen a real pandemic hit like this. And so, the growth after the pandemic has also had some implications for recovery and so forth. So yes, it is a little bit different, composition of the Company is a little different, but we feel really good about what we're seeing, and are very excited about the accelerated growth we're seeing in Credit Karma and in small business, and ready to jump into tax season. Thank you, Kash. Appreciate that. Well, in the current year, as I spoke about earlier, we will see a margin adjustment with the acquisition of Mailchimp and so we do though believe that over time, we will continue to expand our margins as we've talked about from this new step-down level going forward. But as we become more and more of a platform, we see opportunities for us just across the Company, whether it is in technology and being able to increase the velocity of development on our platform and driving more services, using things like money movement across the Company, and our fraud and risk capabilities not having to duplicate those across the Company. Or in customer success is another great example, where we're scaling a common customer success platform so that we can more efficiently and effectively serve customers. And then also in the go-to-market area, really leveraging a common infrastructure to be able to more effectively target customers, manage our sales and marketing processes also. So, we do see a number of opportunities all across the P&L that as we look forward, there will be opportunities for us to leverage this."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Kim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start in fiscal year 2022 with continued momentum across the Company, given our strategy of becoming a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have nearly a $300 billion addressable market driven by digital tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. First quarter revenue grew 52%, including 32 points from the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by small business and self-employed group revenue growth of 22%, and Credit Karma revenue of $418 million, another record quarter. Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter.  As a result, both of our strong start to the year and the close of Mailchimp transaction, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings-per-share guidance for fiscal year 2022. Michelle will cover this in detail later. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets for solving the largest problems are customers states face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well-positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionized speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market.  Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. I am extremely proud of the momentum we are seeing with Credit Karma. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects, solving a two-sided problem. We are focused on our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets, and access financial experts and insights. Credit Karma achieved record high revenue again in Q1. We continue to deliver innovation across all verticals fueled by our proprietary Lightbox platform, enabling personalized experiences for our members, creating a network effect. Within the core, partners ' usage of Lightbox reached all-time highs across both credit cards and personal loans.  Lightbox more than doubled the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma. Within the growth verticals, we're solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers. Karma Drive is giving U.S. members the opportunity to see if they can save money on auto insurance with usage-based pricing. We're actively exploring expansion opportunities with Lightbox in other verticals, including auto loans, building off of the success as we've seen in credit cards and personal loans. Within the emerging verticals, we remain focused on innovation with Credit Karma money. We integrated Credit Karma money into TurboTax last season and experimented with how we could best meet our customers ' needs and announced an integration with QuickBooks Online Payroll.  Given our learnings, we are excited about launching our improved experiences in the upcoming tax season. We believe Credit Karma Money is the key to driving growth in frequency of visits over time, one of the many key drivers of average revenue per monthly active user. Zooming out, we continue to grow members and are focused on building trust by delivering personalized financial products right for members, helping members save money, pay down debt, and get faster access to their money while providing insight and advice. Over time, we're creating a virtual cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transaction, and monetization across our ecosystem.  Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggled with cash flow and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. In fiscal year 2021, total payments volume on our platform grew 40% year-over-year to over $90 billion. An online payment volume grew more than 60% driven by an increase in customer using our payments offering. As we continue to innovate for our customers and payments, those using QuickBooks cash of nearly 3 times higher engagement compared to customers who've just used QuickBooks Online. To accelerate engagement and usage of our platform, we recently introduced Get Paid Upfront, a game - changing innovation that will help qualified customers get paid soon after their invoice is set.  Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advance. We're seeing strong traction with QBO Advance, with customers growing to 118,000 in fiscal year 2021, up 57% year-over-year. As we continue to move up-market and serve these customers most critical needs, we're seeing a services ecosystem ARPC that is 4x higher than the ARPC for QBO customers. We're pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plans to win. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. This will be further fueled the by Mailchimp. I'm delighted that we closed Mailchimp.  They closed the acquisition earlier this month, which seeks to significantly accelerate 2 of our Big Bets, bet: to be the center of small business growth, and to disrupt the small business mid-market. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant paying-point for small and mid-market businesses. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First priority is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform to help customers get their business online, market their business, manage their customers ' relationships, get paid, access capital, pay employees, manage cash flow, and be compliant with virtual experts at their fingertips, all in one place. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM, and e-commerce suite for mid-market customers at an attractive price point, enabling mid-market customers to use the power of the platform to grow their business.  And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. With Mailchimp now part of the Intuit family, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses to combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. This is where the real magic happens. Our combined platform technology enables us to move with speed, and we've already seen strong interest from our customers. The teams are hard at work, and we are excited about the opportunity ahead. Foundational to our Company's success is building a high-performance culture. I want to take a moment to acknowledge our progress with our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.  Last year, we declared our focus on increasing the percentages of women in technology roles and underrepresented minorities across our business. We achieved 30% and 13% respectively and we are inspired to accelerate our plans and push even harder as much work remains to be done. Additionally, we've made meaningful progress supporting our communities. First, we recently announced the Intuit Climate Action Marketplace, which will help 1 million U.S. small businesses find sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions. This is part of our decade-long climate positive goal to go beyond net carbon neutral and reduce global carbon emissions by 2 million metric tons by 2030, or 50 times greater than our 2018 operational footprint. We also recently announced a 23-year partnership with the Los Angeles Clippers that includes economic benefits for the local community with Intuit Dome, the team's future home.  And finally, we launched Intuit Ventures to invest in the startup community and accelerate FinTech innovation for consumers and small businesses. All the work we do starts with our mission of powering prosperity around the world. And I'm proud of the momentum across the Company and delivering on that mission for our customers and communities. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. We are off to a strong start this year with continued momentum across the Company, given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that's powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what our employees have accomplished this quarter and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers. Now let's open it up to your questions. Yeah, Ken, thanks for the question. In terms of Lightbox, as we talked about it at Investor Day, we've actually made significant progress year-over-year in terms of penetration. I think what we talked about at Investor Day is we had 50% and 40% penetration in credit cards and personal loans compared to, I think, 40, 20 a year before. One, we have significant penetration opportunity ahead of us. I think equally as important, if not more, is what financial institutions are seeing, which is really the payoff for their investments. And so, more and more financial institutions are joining the platform and this gives us, really, an opportunity to significantly increase penetration.  I think that's the way I would probably give you the punch line. Our penetration in credit cards is, I think, less than 5%, just as an example, and personal loans and other verticals are even lower than that. So, Lightbox, the trust we build with our members, the trust we are building with our partners gives us an opportunity for significant penetration, and I think are sort of best years are ahead of us when you think about Lightbox and particularly a penetration. In terms of your question around expansion, auto loans are just one example of where we can expand Lightbox and there are other areas that we've not talked about publicly. I won't do it today until we see our further proof points where we can further expand Lightbox. I think this is 13 years of investments that now positions us to really deliver for members, partners, and really create this network effect. Yeah, Keith, thanks for the question. I would say the majority, if not all, compared to previous quarters, is simply customer growth. Its improved mix based on the traction of QuickBooks Advance, QuickBooks Live to a lesser degree, and things like full-service Payroll, and just all the innovation we've been doing in payments with instant deposit making it easier to use our payments offering, and now our new launch with Get Paid Upfront. So, I would say the majority of what we're starting to experience is the actual innovation on the platform and the portfolio that we have solving a broad range of needs for our customers. I would say bounce back from the pandemic, of course, happened and we started experiencing the pickup, but that was, I would say, 4 to 6 months ago. I think now we're seeing the actual true performance of the platform. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll take you back to the 3 priorities that we've declared because I think it goes after the great question that you've asked. First and foremost, our number one priority is really around creating one growth platform, and it's really a lot of the work behind the scenes in terms of building data pipelines and connecting the services so that the magical power of the data, both Mailchimp data and QuickBooks data can come together for the customer to put the power of the insights in their hands. So first and foremost, it's all about the product and creating one growth platform. The second is we see a huge opportunity to serve mid-market. As you know, we're already doing that from a financial management solutions perspective with QuickBooks Advance.  Now we're going to, in essence, build out the capabilities on Mailchimp and really disrupt the mid-market because this is a huge need for mid-market. And I would say third is actually having a global playbook and investing -- accelerating our investments in go-to-market, which I think will get at the last question that you asked that I didn't answer yet, and that is we want customers to have choice. So, if customers first want to engage with Mailchimp to be able to take their business online, to market their business and use CRM tools, they can use Mailchimp and -- but we'll make sure everything is payment-enabled. And then over time, if they want to use all of the invoicing capabilities, payroll capabilities, access to capital, ensure that they're compliant, all of that will be enabled within Mailchimp.  The vice versa is true. If you're using QuickBooks and you want to start using capabilities to market your business and manage your customers, all the capabilities of Mailchimp will be available to you, and Mailchimp could end up being, for instance, a nab item on the left-hand side. So, we will let customers make choice is, I think, the headline answer to your question. We will go to market separately. We will go to market together. We will raise awareness and ensure that customers know that there is one place where they can run their business, and more importantly, the power of all their data will be in one place to fuel their success. That's the approach that we're taking. You're welcome. Yeah. Thank you for the question. A couple of things I would start with. Last year, when you look at the full year of Credit Karma compared to the prior year, we grew 37%. And our new guidance for Credit Karma going forward is a range of 35% to 37%. And so, I think what you see within that is there has been a macro bounce back. But really a lot of what we're really seeing is the innovation on the platform, the power of Lightbox, the fact that members are getting better matches to things that they are looking for. Financial institutions are \u2013 and insurance companies are seeing the power of the platform.  And it's really just creating that network effect. So, I think what we're gaining confidence in is just the innovation, the technology investments in Lightbox, and in context of the macro environment as we look ahead that gives us confidence around the performance of Credit Karma. And again, I would just remind us that this is more of a longer-term comment. Credit Karma is a platform, and we're creating an ecosystem effect here. Credit Karma is part of the TurboTax experience, and we're excited for all of you to see what we're going to be launching in the coming tax season. TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma experience. Credit Karma is part of the payroll experience. So really think about Intuit as 1 platform with many platforms that solves different problems, and that's really what fuels our confidence as we look ahead. Yeah. Well, I'm not going to talk about the marketing budget, but what I will share with you is it's very consistent and durable in context of what you've seen in the last couple of years. We are very focused on really fundamentally changing how you get your taxes done if you need assistance. And you're going to continue to see us be assertive in terms of how we raise awareness with 88 million customers that need assistance and how there's a better way to get your assistance. And also, the under-penetrated segments that we've talked about, which is Latinx, the investment community, and the self-employed. I think you can -- what you should expect is our investments on a platform has continued in those areas. We're really excited about the season coming up, and our marketing efforts will be really focused in those areas to continue to raise awareness. You're very welcome Yes. Thank you for your kind comments and the question. I would say that it's very consistent with what we talked to you all about at Investor Day, and that is that we're continuing to see the acquisition trends that we would expect in the U.S. across-the-board, both in the low-end of the market but also the trends that we're seeing in the mid-market, so those trends continue. And as we've shared before, we're not overly reliant by any means on new business formations. From just a health perspective, I would say the U.S. is consistent with what we talked about with all of you a few months ago.  And I would say outside of the U.S., again, very consistent with what before, the recovery has not been like the U.S. Now, if I were to double-click on that, I would say behind the U.S. has been Canada. And I think we're going to start seeing UK and Australia start to come back. Sorry, UK and France. And then Australia is, I would say behind UK and France. We do believe that in the next year or less, that international will start to slowly bounce back.  And the reason for just the slowness in international bouncing back is there's just been so many starts and stops those small businesses that just lost confidence. Do I build up inventory? Do I go hire more employees? Do I increase my own marketing budget? That they've just been slower in bouncing back. But we believe, within the next year or so, we'll see that strength. But the headline news is U.S. continues to be strong and match what we've expected, and international role will bounce back within a year. Yeah. We are really excited about just the possibilities of what we can do for members -- Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. Last year really was a learning year and I think we're going to learn a lot more this year. Listen, our goal is we want every TurboTax customer to be using Credit Karma and all the benefits of Credit Karma, and we want every Credit Karma member to be using TurboTax, whether they want to do it themselves or they need assistance. I think we're going to be one year better than we were last year in terms of all of our experiences, in terms of just the investments that we've made and the experiences, and we're excited about it. But just to put it in context, at Investor Day, we shared with you our Horizon framework. Horizon 1 being sort of revenue impact within 0 months to 18 months, Horizon 2 being 18 months to 36 months, and Horizon 3 being 36 months plus. We actually put the impact of Credit Karma integrated as part of TurboTax and vice versa is almost 3 years out because we really want to nail the experience. But nevertheless, we're leaning in and we're excited about the things we're going to be launching in the weeks to come. You are very welcome. Yeah, Michael. Thank you for your kind words, and great question. When we declared our bet around connecting people to experts and creating our virtual expert platform, we have been, I think we're onto now, I don't know 5 plus years, really investing in this virtual expert platform. There are so many underlying technologies, services where AI is being used to ensure that the platform matches the right customer to the right experts, to make the platform simple and easy-to-use for experts and we feel really confident relative to just the where we are with the virtual expert platform, and our focus, intentionally, has been really about serving customers when it comes to tax time and helping small businesses with the bookkeeping and eventually also with their taxes. But more importantly, just helping them run their business.  And we have so much opportunity ahead of us just in that space. With that said, we do have a few, what we call small mission-based genes that are exploring other spaces because we can leverage a lot of the capabilities of this virtual expert platform to serve spaces like marketing, potentially spaces like financial services. So, we are doing experiments but very intentionally to ensure that we can learn. I think I will just end with the opportunities of where we can take this virtual expert platform is endless. However, the biggest growth opportunity ahead of us right now is helping customers with taxes and helping small businesses run their business. And then as these other -- our verticals become reality, we'll, of course, share our plans with all of you. But it is something that will extend over time horizontally, continue verticals. Yeah, Brad. Thank you for your kind words and the question. I would -- I'll say 2 things. 1. Really the majority of our growth continues to come from customer growth and mix in a much lesser extent price so you should just be aware of that, and 2. There's nothing that we've seen from the price increase that's outside of the balance of what we expected. So, the short answer is no. It's within our control limit as we expected it based on the testing that we had done. Yeah, you know the -- well, first of all, we've not divulged our traction other than I would tell you. We generally are excited. As part of many things that we are providing in our portfolio to customers, giving them early access to wages, I think a lot of what we are learning and a lot of what we're excited about as we move forward. It depends on the customer and the cohort of customers. There are certain customers that depending on their situation and how much they depend on living weekly -- connected to their weekly paycheck.  If you live paycheck to paycheck, you are much more focused on can I get early access to that versus if you don't live week-to-week. So, we're learning about those cohorts within our payroll to your question and where we can get traction and where it's just not a need for customers. I would say more broadly, we are excited about early access to wages both providing it across payroll standalone, providing it through Credit Karma. And frankly I think over time this is just something that's going to be commodity. I think everybody is going to have a product feature that gives you early access to the wages. For us it's not just about the feature, it's about the ecosystem effect that it creates for our customers and our members. Yeah. Thank you. Yes, absolutely, Brent. One of the things that we -- one of our mechanisms that we have as a Company is called our Big Bet review, where we take our officers of the Company through the experiences of each of the Big Bets to what we've learned, where we are, and where we're headed. And this is the last Big Bet review happened to be one where we brought in Ben as a team from Mailchimp, and actually walked through the experience in detail, where we are, and where we're going. And I would just tell you that we continue to even get more excited as we've closed the deal because the needs of our customers are in all the areas that you mentioned. They are -- and every customer it's in a different place, but customers are really looking for ways to be able to engage, getting new customers.  It's their bread and butter. Almost 70% of our customers are looking for ways to get new customers. We now have those capabilities and we'll integrate it into QuickBooks and vice versa, QuickBooks into Mailchimp. They want to be able to manage their existing customers in an automated way, in an insightful way where everything is automated. They don't have to know when do I follow up with a customer, what additional products can I sell them. All of that can get automated through Mailchimp. And one of the things people don't realize is one of the largest ways that you still engage customers, we see it through what we do in TurboTax, is actually email. So now we have all those capabilities.  We have abilities to put you on mega platforms with all of our digital assets, manage all of your existing relationships, all the email capabilities, but more importantly, it's the leveraging the power of the data, the customer data, and the purchase data to help you understand who is the customer, who bought what, what did they not buy, who's leading your shopping card, and how do you pursue them. It's consistent with what we've talked about before. That's the opportunity ahead, and that's about the work that we do now on the product to put the power of those capabilities in the hands of our customers. We couldn't be more excited to help our customers with their success. So, stay tuned. Yeah, it's a great question. It's one thing that's just really excites us about the Live platform. 1. There's 88 million folks that use an assisted method today. Within the assisted method, you have 10 million folks every year where there's churn, they go -- jump from one assisted method to another. So, from 1 accountant to another or from 1 store to an accountant. And then within the TurboTax base, the do-it yourself or as we have 4 million people that leave, and they ultimately go to an assisted method. I think that the answer to your question is it's all the above. We've seen conversion improvements, retention improvements.  We've seen TurboTax customers that did it themselves a year before where they had a life change, or they just weren't sure if they did their home deductions the right way or if they had a kid and the kid went to college, how that ultimately account for those deductions where they are now using the live platform and vice versa. You may use the life platform and I've enough confidence with the year after, you do it yourself and then you may then after that bounce back and now we're seeing 3, 4 years of trends. Really, it's all of the above with the largest, I would say, driver being folks that use a different assisted method coming onto a platform and, of course, those that have life changes within TurboTax, growing with TurboTax, and using the live platform. And we just see that continuing as we view this opportunity with a 10-year lens. One of the sorts of essential strategic principles that we have within Credit Karma is that it is an agnostic platform. And our financial institutions and all our partners see the power of that, how diligent and intentional we are about not creating our own products, but ensuring that we match members with a product that's right for them. And a lot of the capabilities that we have within Credit Karma ultimately had an institution that's participating in it. So that is not a concern that we have. Our say due is very, very high with financial institutions and we just believe that that's the beginning of it, especially with attraction of Lightbox which actually delivers more success for members and more success for financial institutions. So, it is not a concern of ours. Yeah. You're welcome. Kash, thank you, 1, for your kind comment and it's a wonderful question on all those areas, the labor shortage, some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business, and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I would make a broad comment that I would say we are experiencing. When you couple what happened with the pandemic starting in March of 2020, where it really, I think, forced everyone around the globe, whether you're a small business or not, but let's stay focused on small businesses to reinvent yourself. And it really accelerated the shift to virtual solutions.  It accelerated the shift to going online whether it's how you invoice get paid, how you do your payroll, how you do your time tracking. And I think that movement which is just simply continuing, I don't think wherever going to go back to the old way. I think this pandemic really has accelerated the shift in those areas that I mentioned, in particular to, of course, to digital money offering. I think that coupled with this not only labor shortage but also labor movements from job to job, some of the supply chain challenges that generally we believe as I talked to my peers will get -- start to get addressed by the second half of 2022, first half of 2023, an inflation is actually causing small businesses to leverage more platforms.  And so, if I then bring that back to our platform and the fact that if you use our platform, you can get paid upfront, you can get instant deposit, you can do same-day payroll, you can use an expert to ensure that you've got the best deductions as a small business and to ensure that you're running your business effectively, and the fact that you can do more with less people if you use one platform. That's where the power of Mailchimp comes into play, rather than having multiple tools where you're bouncing back and forth between tools and you're not really sure what your customer profitability is, when you should follow up with the customer, how to acquire more customers.  All of those things are thrust to the use of our platform, and our platform is actually built to help you grow your business with less focus on labor and to be able to embrace as much as possible the inflation. Now, ultimately, we have to address overtime, and I believe it will get address some of these supply chain issues and inflationary issues. But that's where our platform comes into play and why we are so well-positioned for small businesses, and the role we need to play to continue to educate them. Thank you, Brad. I would say 2 big things. One is a full service absolutely has a halo impact on confidence for the customer which actually gets me to the second point, and really the approach which is, we're a platform for our customers and so really if you think customer [Indiscernible], we want our customers to know that they have the ability to do it themselves. They can access an expert, if they need the expert to answer any questions that they have, and/or they can just have you -- us do their taxes for them and do everything digitally.  By the way, midstream if you choose an expert and utilize, you know what? I don't know if I just want to help, I just want to Intuit to do it all for me, we'll do it all for you. So really our approach and now that we've had several years of experimenting and learning with full service is that now we have a true end-to-end platform where we can meet the needs of any customer, and the power has actually grown with customers over time. If they just start out their career or if they're students who they have life change, we have a platform that will meet all of their needs. So that's really the, I would say the headlines of the answers plays a halo effect, which has informed our platform approach as we look ahead. Sure. I would really put last year entirely in the bucket of just learning. And it doesn't mean that's going to change this year. We are a Company that's all about moving fast, experimenting, pivoting, and learning all in context of being stubborn around the vision that we have. Last year was a learning year, although there were some nice member growth impacts to Credit Karma from TurboTax. We're really excited and eager to see how our new innovations and experiences on the platform plays out this year and to see what we learned.  I'll take you back to the reason at Investor Day we put the opportunity of Credit Karma is part of TurboTax experience, and TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma platform as a Horizon 3, is we're really focused on the customer and member experience in nailing that because we know over time we can monetize. So, we're excited about the year ahead. Look, we have 11 months under our belt, learning and adjusting and preparing for this tax season. And we're excited about these experiences being launched and seeing how they play out in the next couple of months. You're welcome. Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thank you. First up on international, we saw some of the same trend given our, not only our execution but the macro environment as we've seen the last couple of quarters. There are certain countries like Canada that have bounced back a bit more strongly. Then there's places like Australia that really have been very slow to bounce back based on the fact that the economy keeps opening and shutting down. And again, our view is within the next year, international should start to come back from a macro perspective.  So, net-net, our trends in our performance, although we're very pleased with that, we believe over time to paint the different picture as the macro environment comes back. In terms of Mailchimp, our focus is the 3 priorities that I mentioned. We want to create an amazing product and platform that brings QuickBooks and Mailchimp together. We want to build the capabilities to go disrupt mid-market.  And then, as Michelle mentioned, we're going to be investing heavily in our global go-to-market. I would say I wouldn't overly anticipate a significant change in our trajectory international because of Mailchimp where there's some fundamental things, we want to get right to ensure that we can truly be the platform that -- where you can grow your business and run your business and over time it will certainly have an impact internationally and we're excited about that because it gives us another foot in the door outside of the U.S. I would say, and I've said this for years, and I think you're used to hear Brad talk about this. I think where the world's biggest hidden secret, and we don't want that secret to hold true anymore. We want to make sure the world knows who Intuit is and what our brands are. And we have data that shows that the more customers learn that TurboTax, Credit Karma, Mailchimp now, and QuickBooks when they learn that they're part of the Intuit brand and the platforms are all connected, it actually has a positive impact on our potential for growth. So, the way we think about Intuit Dome, it is not, for us, a naming rights deal.  We've had many opportunities where we've actually been pursued to be part of deals like this and we pass them up over the years. We did this because one, it's very technology forward dome. We're going to be helping the community. And 2. We're really going to be able to showcase our brands. And it will be yet another way to demonstrate the benefits that we bring to the market as one Intuit platform and the impact that we can have in the lives of consumers and small businesses. That's really how we think about it and why we're excited about it. And by the way, over time, we expected the same return on investment as we do with our marketing investments and that's really what this is. It just goes beyond marketing to impacting the local communities in LA, which we're excited about. You're welcome. Yes. Sure. Thank you. Well, first of all, I really appreciate all the questions. And once again, I want to just thank our employees for their incredible hard work, our customers and our partners for the strong start to the year, and the opportunity we have ahead of us. We're very passionate about fundamentally powering the prosperity of our customers and communities, and we're proud of our accomplishments, and we continue to believe that we are just getting started. Thanks for your question, Thanks for your time, and we will see you at our next earnings call. Bye, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Raiza. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our new CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Welcome, Sandeep, it's nice to have you on the call. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right. Excellent, Kim, thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We grew full year revenue 13%, delivered strong operating margin expansion, and exited the year with momentum. Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our platform and the diversity of our portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times. This past year, we expanded our operating margin again, while investing in the most important areas to drive durable long-term growth. We are guiding to another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2024, even with the macroeconomic environment that is uncertain. We are entering Intuit's most exciting area. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core fueling innovation across our five Big Bets. We've made strong progress in transforming from a tax and accounting platform where consumers and small businesses have to do the work to achieve the benefit that they are seeking, to a global financial platform, where we do the hard work for them. Now, we are creating a future of, done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers to fuel their financial success. This future is only possible because of our history of significant investments in our platform, talent, data and AI and now our accelerated investments in generative AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for 100 million customers. For small businesses, we have a 360-degree view of their business and customers. We have 500,000 customers and financial attributes per small business on our platform and this data gives us insights into behaviors, income streams, expenses, profitability, and cash flows, enabling us to provide personalized experiences and recommendations to help them prosper. Additionally, we have 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform, including income, expenses, credit history, spending history, outstanding loans, cash flow, and tax information, which enables us to become a financial assistant in their pocket. We are using our data to fine-tune our own financial large language models that specialize in solving tax, accounting, cash flow, marketing, and personal finance challenges. The investments that we've made in data and AI over the years allow us to introduce innovations at an accelerated rate. Intuit's rich data platform is a powerful foundation that allows us to create innovative AI-assisted experiences for all of our customers powering their prosperity. In June, we introduced our generative AI operating system called GenOS, to ignite innovation at scale for the benefit of millions of consumers and small businesses. GenOS empowers Intuit technologists to create breakthrough generative AI experiences. We are using a platform approach, giving our teams across Intuit the resources and tools they need to design, build, test and deploy these new experiences with unparalleled speed. This includes our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers, in a cost-effective way. We are entering Intuit\u2019s most exciting era yet and believe the next several years will be game changing. On September 6th, we\u2019ll be hosting Intuit Innovation Day, a virtual event where we will unveil exciting GenAI innovation across our platform and how it will drive business growth in the years ahead. We look forward to sharing more with you then. Now, let me turn to our Big Bets which are driving growth and benefits for our customers today. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress in one of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are, revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and getting paid upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 22% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 80% of businesses still pay other firms via paper checks. We recently expanded the availability of the beta of our native bill pay solution by 10x. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end QuickBooks and Mailchimp customer growth platform. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite. And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This last quarter, we implemented our first generative AI capability in Mailchimp, the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. This quarter, we launched the beta of a new product announcement generator, which uses AI to automatically create an email that a small business can send to its customers. We also announced over 150 new and updated features at our recent Mailchimp conference in London, designed to support the needs of advanced marketers, including a calendar view, custom reporting and analytics, more e-commerce advanced segmentation, more real time behavioral data based on e-commerce automations, and SMS marketing. Lineup changes and free trials are driving positive trends in year-over-year paid customer growth, which accelerated this quarter. We continue to make progress in mid-market, our 90-day retention rate this quarter the highest it\u2019s been in two years. We have also translated the product into five different languages. We will share more on the outcomes we\u2019re delivering across our five Big Bets at our Investor Day. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our products, we are moving at high velocity. This will help us put more money in our customers\u2019 pockets, save them time, and ensure complete confidence in every financial decision they make. As we lead this next technological shift, we are well positioned to power prosperity for our customers and communities that we serve with a leadership team that is built for the era of AI. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. It\u2019s great to have you on the call, my friend.\nSandeep Aujla: Thank you, Sasan. I'm excited to be here and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2023, including total revenue growth of 13%, strong margin expansion, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% and 22% respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered results that exceeded the high-end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $2.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $17 million versus a loss of $75 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $627 million versus $433 million last year up 45%. GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $0.32 versus a loss of $0.20 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.65 versus $1.10 last year, up 50%. Now turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 24% for the full year, which included four points of benefit from a full year of Mailchimp's revenue this year versus three quarters last year. Online ecosystem revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 30% for the full year. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in Q4 and 26% in fiscal '23. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year were driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shifts. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services grew 20% in Q4 driven by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. For the full fiscal year, '23 QuickBooks Online Services grew 34% driven by Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in this quarter reflects an increase in customers' adopting our payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue grew mid-teens in Q4. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offering to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q4 and 31% in fiscal '23. The power of our small business platform continues to resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow across all types of economic environments. Our platform remains critical to our customers' success and we continue to see them adopt multiple offerings across the platform to manage their business. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low 20s. We are approximately two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remained on license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. We also raised our desktop prices across multiple products last September, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue building out our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth of 15% to 20% per year in long term. Now shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $424 million in Q4, down 11%. On a product basis, the decline in Q4 was driven primarily by macroeconomic headwinds in personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. Full year revenue was $1.6 billion down 9%. Credit Karma represented 11% of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal '23. We have seen continued stability across our core verticals, which led to the improvement in year-over-year performance during Q4 versus Q3. For context, credit cards and personal loans represented nearly 50% and nearly 30% of Credit Karma\u2019s revenue in fiscal '23, respectively. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Credit Karma annual revenue growth of 20% to 25% per year long term. Now shifting to Consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $4.1 billion in fiscal '23, up 6%. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, introducing volatility into Consumer Group results. However, average annual trends over this four-year period are more in line with the long-term trends. Over the past four years, Consumer Group revenue increased by an average of 10% annually, which aligns with our long-term growth expectations of 8% to 12%. While this was a unique tax season, I am proud of the progress the team made by transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live, which grew revenues 17% this year, while customers grew 12%. Looking ahead, we are confident in multiple growth drivers. First, we see a large runway ahead of us with TurboTax Live, given our ability to use both GenAI and human experts powered by AI to deliver confidence for our customers. We are investing in scaling our full-service offering, which has a good product market fit based on the highest product recommendation scores of any product at Intuit this year. Second, we are trying to scale our business tax offering, following a successful pilot this year. And third, we see significant opportunities ahead, driving Credit Karma members to TurboTax and giving TurboTax filers faster access to their money with Credit Karma Money. Given the growth opportunities I just shared, we continue to expect annual Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% per year over the long term. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $561 million in fiscal '23, up 3%. Now let me share more on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. Approximately $4.2 billion of the debt is maturing over the next 15 months and we are evaluating refinancing opportunities subject to market and other conditions. We repurchased $465 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2 billion during fiscal '23. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim to be -- is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share payable on October 17, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We recently finalized our three and one year strategic plan. I feel confident in the investments we are making to drive durable growth, including executing across our Big Bet and continuing the accelerated pace of innovation, particularly with GenAI. We have a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. We manage for the short and the long-term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2024 guidance includes total company revenue of $15.89 billion to $16.105 billion, a growth of 11% to 12%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and a decline of 3% to a growth of 3% for Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $9.37 to $9.67, growth of 11% to 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $16.17 to $16.47 growth of 12% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2024. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.21, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 to $2. We are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '24, we expect to pay approximately $700 million in cash tax payments related to fiscal '23, which were deferred due to the IRS disaster-area tax relief. You can find a full fiscal 2024 and Q1 guidance details in our press release as well as on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you. And wrapping up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our five Big Bets, the investments that we are making in GenAI and our leadership team driving our platform innovation. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. In today's uncertain macro-environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and mission-critical than ever to our customers. I look forward to your attendance at our Intuit Innovation Day on September 6th, and Investor Day on September 28th. With that, let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and a really nice quarter, and nice to see a forward EPS guide ahead kind of where consensus was to see those numbers start moving up. My inbox getting filled up with questions about the consumer business and the consumer guide. You've talked about a longer-term 8% to 12% growth there, the four-year CAGR of 10%, but this year you are looking for 7% to 8%, so below that guidance framework. And I think what people are trying to understand is why that is? Last year was a difficult tax season. Did you pull the levers too hard on pricing? Or what was it, do we need to refill the tank in terms of units like? What is it that's going to keep this tax season to be underperforming those longer-term targets? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Hey, Keith, thank you for your question. Let me give you the headline, but allow me to unpack it. I think the headline is we are just simply being prudent. Our focus on future growth and our bullishness does not change at all. Let me unpack that. First and foremost, when you look at the assisted segment, there is a $30 billion TAM, and $20 billion of it is consumer-assisted segment and $10 billion of it is business segment. And the second is the secular shift towards digitization will continue and only accelerate in the years to come. And with that as context, we probably saw some of our biggest green shoots this year, which is why we are probably more bullish about what's possible in this business than we were even three to four years ago, and I would put it in two buckets, Credit Karma and then the assisted segment. In Credit Karma, just as a reminder, our vision from the moment that we bought Credit Karma was to create one consumer platform where a consumer can manage their financial lives, manage their money, and get their taxes done in one place. After several years of just rapid experimentation, we had a massive breakthrough this past year where our customer growth within the Credit Karma platform versus a number of Credit Karma members who became TurboTax customers was up 5x and we are scaling that both on the product side and on the business model side as that gives us a lot of confidence going into next year and beyond. The second is going to be assisted segment and that's in three parts. First and foremost is we actually had product market fit this past year at full service, our biggest focus was how do we scale. We had some breakthroughs in how to scale. In fact, as you heard from Sandeep, we had our best product recommendations score of any product across the company and we are significantly leaning into that in the coming year. The second is business tax. We launched and learned to get the product market fit in business tax. That is not going to be available, both across our QuickBooks Live platform and directly going to market with TurboTax and we have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, will come to TurboTax looking for business tax. We've never had an offering. We will next year and we are scaling it. The last thing, I would say in the assisted segment, one of the biggest things that we've learned in the last year is local matters. What that means, people will go on Google, and they will search, if I'm in San Diego is there a pro close to me, while we've never been good been found and local and in fact, when you look at the experts that we have, we are 10 miles from every home in household in the United States and so we're going big on local this year. And so when I look at our green shoots in the assisted segment and in Credit Karma, it gives us a lot of confidence as we look at this coming year and the future and I'll end with where I started, was the essence of your question about our guidance, we're simply being prudent given the year that we just had.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Great quarter and Sandeep, congratulations on your first earnings call and looking forward to working with you. Sasan, I want to ask about your bill pay, what sort of feedback have you been getting from your beta customer from the QuickBooks native bill pay? And how should we think about the near-term opportunity as you're switching the legacy powered by payment solution with now your native bill pay? And then on the broader vision side on small business, now that you have full end-to-end cash flow management, now you have AR invoice payment and AP bill pay, then you have money bank accounts. So what is your broader vision in terms of that monetizing the whole ecosystem?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Siti, thank you for your question. Let me take it in two parts. First and foremost, you've heard us in the past year plus talk about digitizing B2B with respect to all of the manual work that gets done today in terms of 80% of the back and forth between small businesses is all sort of paper checks and manual. And our goal has been to digitize all of that. And one last element of what we needed to do was to launch bill pay. I think the headline I would just give is -- the feedback we've been getting has even gone better than what we thought, and we're now at a place where we are 10x-ing our beta, and we hope to have it available to all of our customers soon. So we feel very good about what we are seeing in Bill Pay and how fast we're able to build it based on the platform capabilities that we have and the feedback that we've gotten from customers. I think back to your second question, you're right. And in fact, the vision I would take you back to is that we have set out to be the source of truth for a business and to truly be the center of small business growth. And in order to do that, we have to have capabilities that not only help a small business grow their customers, retain their customers, market to their customers, but to be able to manage their cash flow and be able to manage their employees. We now have all of those capabilities end-to-end. And I think particularly, what's important, that advantages us to deliver for our customers is the data and our AI investments that we've made in the last five-plus years. And I think I would just encourage you to attend -- and if you can attend when it's on real time, watch the replay of our September 6 Intuit Innovation Day. And you will see how with our data, AI and GenAI capabilities we help customers manage their cash flow and really digitize all of money movement in a way that's so intuitive, so easy and delivered at a moment of truth. So we're quite excited about what's possible as we look at this coming year, about the years ahead. And let me, by the way, be very explicit that none of our potential innovation that you're going to experience in September 6 around GenAI is included in our guidance. But we believe it is fundamentally revolutionary as we think about the world we're going to create in the future.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Sasan, when you mentioned prudent in the tax guide. I'm curious, are you baking in more wiggle room this year than in past years in the guidance or can you just walk through what you mean by prudent?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Great question. Well, first of all, I'll just take you back to what you already know, but I think it's important that we start there. This past year, IRS returns, we continue to estimate we'll be down a couple of points. The do-it-yourself category will be down nearly 1 point. And the driver of that, which we are now certain of, based on all the working analysis that we've done, is we had a number of folks that came in to get their stimulus dollars and tax credits, and so it was pandemic driven. And so that created just what you heard from Sandeep, a sort of a very unusual tax season. But then when you step back and look at the last four-year trend, it sort of straightened out. And so what we mean by prudent is really a couple of things. One, we're not assuming IRS growth in our numbers this year, and we're not banking on all of the innovation that I just shared paying off this coming year. And that's just part of us being prudent because we want to demonstrate to all of you that this is a business that grows 8% to 12%. And by doing so, we must deliver the results. And so it's just being very intentional and very prudent. As we think about, by the way, our guidance holistically, it's not just TurboTax, it's TurboTax, it's Credit Karma and the way we thought about Small Business. But those are -- that's the sort of the definition of what we mean by prudent.\nBrent Thill: Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. You delivered outsized margin expansion this past year. You've mentioned a focus on cost controls, given the tougher environment throughout the year, realize it's one of the guiding principles, but maybe, Sandeep, if you can just speak to what's allowing you to guide for continued margin expansion as a starting point here? And maybe how we should think about what's allowing for continued margin expansion as you break into the upper 30s there on the operating margin side? Thanks.\nSandeep Aujla: Thanks for the question, Michael. And let me unpack it a little bit. We go through a [indiscernible] planning process, as I shared in the prepared remarks. And due that process, if you look at one of the biggest needle movers to deliver growth both in the near term and the long term, so durable growth levers for the company. And we make sure those are funded for success, inclusive of Big Bets and investments in GenAI. So the 40 to 60 bps of guidance reflects those investments and, quite frankly, reflects the strength and resilience of our platform. As a reminder, this is an expansion we're delivering on top of the 3.5 points of expansion we delivered over the last three years. As I look ahead, I see plenty of runway for us to continue to operate in accordance with our financial principles to grow expenses slower than revenue, therefore, implying a margin expansion. And really, as I look at it, what gives me confidence is that we are an AI-driven expert platform, and we operate as an ecosystem across technology, across customer success, across marketing. So in addition to giving us a competitive advantage for having faster time to market as a -- from opting as an ecosystem, it also gives us advantage in getting operating leverage as we scale as a business.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Your line is open.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yeah. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I'll focus on the Small Business and Self-Employed full year guide, which was really strong. So I know there's a bunch of moving pieces in there between customer ads, mix shift, online services attach and price. But are you able to help us understand how each of those levers are contributing to the guide? And based on what you're seeing in the environment, what's giving you comfort and the durability of those growth drivers?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your questions. Let me start us off and Sandeep, please jump in if you want to add anything. First of all, we have a framework at the company level where we want to drive the majority of our growth from volume and mix and the lesser part from price, but we always focus on pricing for value. And so when we look at our growth drivers this year, it is coming from customer growth, and it is coming from mix and to a lesser extent this year compared to last year, by the way, from price. With that as context, I would just remind you that the big picture, when you look at our opportunity this coming year, but even in the next three to five years plus, we now have a platform and a portfolio of services where we have the opportunity to drive further adoption of our services from Mailchimp to payments, to payroll to time tracking and to a lot of our new innovations around Bill Pay and digitizing B2B that I just mentioned. But also, although we are three to four years in, we're just at the beginning of what's possible in the midmarket. Big market is a significant ARPC opportunity because these customers use a lot of the capabilities that I just mentioned, except they pay a lot more. And we're just at the beginning of the flywheel of penetrating mid-market. So when you look at the portfolio of the services that we have, the strength of the experience that we're delivering because of data and AI and because of mid-market, it allows us to drive most of our growth from customer growth and mix. And none of that, by the way, takes into account what's possible as we look into the future with our generative AI experiences that you'll be able to observe on September 6. But those are the main drivers.\nSandeep Aujla: And Taylor, I would add, over the long term, we remain committed to our growth algorithm of 10% to 20% ARPC and customer growth. That remains unchanged. And really, as Sasan mentioned, is our innovation across our platform that gives us -- opens up the aperture for us to cross-sell and upsell our customers across more offerings on our platform as those opportunities for us to price for value as we look ahead.\nTaylor McGinnis: Great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nKim Watkins: Raiza, we\u2019re ready for our next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. I hope you can hear me okay. So the recession that everybody's been expecting, it doesn't seem to be quite happening. Sasan, I know you've got a great read on your SMB ecosystem. What are some of the indicators that you're seeing? And if you've already proactively addressed this, my apologies for bringing it up again. But what are some of the forward-looking indicators that you see in the Credit Karma business or the SMB ecosystem that give you renewed confidence that we are going to be okay? Because your fiscal '24 guidance definitely is not reflecting of any caution in the environment, but more like a continuation of what we've seen in the last four quarters. Just some thoughts there would be great. Thank you so much and congrats.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. And you're loud and clear, my friend. So let me start with Small Business. And generally, I would just lead with they continue to be healthy, but they're challenged in this environment. The specifics that I would share is the cash flow -- cash reserves of Small Businesses is 90% of what it was this time last year. However, it is still stronger than pre-pandemic. The -- in terms of looking for labor and finding employees to drive their growth, that's still quite strong. And in fact, in this environment, Small Businesses are able to do a better job finding what they need versus when the market was hot, which is good for them because then they can deliver for their customers and drive growth. And the last thing I would just say is there are certain sectors that are very weak, transportation, real estate, advertising, is very weak within small businesses. So that's the aggregate picture. I'll end with what where I started, struggling, but still healthy compared to pre-pandemic. On the consumer side, let me hit on sort of two different points. I'll quickly hit on Credit Karma. As you know, Sandeep mentioned, what we're seeing is stability and our innovation that we've been focused on is really getting hold, and there's some exciting things that we're working on in Credit Karma that we'll share both on September 6 and at Investor Day, one where we redesigned the entire app. And we have begun to roll it out to a small cohort of customers and will eventually scale it. And we're actually seeing very good engagement with the redesigned app. And then that, coupled with our GenAI experiences, along with all of our innovation with Lightbox and Credit Karma Money gives us a lot of excitement around the future, none of which, by the way, is in our guidance. But the headline is stability in Credit Karma and lots of innovation that is helping us with where we are and coming. If I just focus on the consumer, a couple of things I would say. If you look back to last March of 2022, credit scores are, on average, down 13 points. Credit balances are up about 30%. And the credit band of like [600 to 660] (ph) have the largest balances. They're carrying about $10,000 on average. And the Gen Z balances have gone up the most, are up 45% year-over-year. So job market is still good. People still have jobs, but there's certainly some level of strain on the consumer.\nKash Rangan: Brilliant. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Sasan, following up on that Credit Karma commentary. Obviously, the world we live in today is different than when you acquired the business. Do you think the long-term growth rate of Credit Karma is meaningfully different in a world where interest rates are mid-single digits versus zero? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're very bullish on the business. And in fact, a couple of things that I would share with you, which we can talk more about at Investor Day, but just not to leave you hanging, the monetization model in Credit Karma is how many members you have, how frequently they engage. And there's a model for -- every time a customer engages, there is a average revenue per customer that we benefit from. And in fact, this past year, in '23, when our results were down year-over-year, our frequency of engagement is actually higher than the prior two years where we had 37% growth and 58% growth. Now why is that? It's because of all of our innovation. It's because the customer is engaging but in many areas, credit is still tight. So when credit begins to open up, and that's the stability that we're seeing now, we view this business will accelerate back to the 20% to 25% growth rate. Plus I'll remind you that, that plus the integration with TurboTax drives actually more stickiness, more monetization and truly created this one consumer platform, which was our vision from day one when we acquired Credit Karma. And with all of the data and AI capabilities that we have in our accelerated GenAI experiences, as I said earlier, you're going to see on September 6, some of the new innovations that are coming that will make it easier for customers to find what they need, the benefits that they need to engage in the financial products that they want and manage their money. And so all of that leads to our view is completely unchanged relative to the long-term expectations of 20% to 25% growth in Credit Karma.\nSandeep Aujla: And Brad, the one thing I would add to this because you asked about a scenario in which interest rates are higher. When interest rates are higher, the consumer have a higher propensity to shop around because even a small improvement in the rates that they're getting, has a bigger difference in terms of the interest rate they're paying and a bigger difference to their bottom line. So in fact, the product becomes more important critical to the end user in a higher rate environment.\nBrad Reback: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Good evening, Sasan. This year, you're really focused, at least from a TV advertising standpoint on full service, really trying to get the message out. And I'm wondering, one of the things you talked about is being a little bit more prudent on revenue growth on the consumer business. I'm wondering are -- will your strategy change at all and how you're marketing the full-service product? And how did the full-service product perform compared to your expectations this quarter as well -- this year as well?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Great question. Let me give you an answer that I think you'll find somewhat helpful and somewhat vague intentionally. We learned a lot this year. We came into the year with a full service offering that has product markets, that as you know, it's all AI-driven. And we can virtually get things done within an hour or same day. We learned a lot around health and scaling and how to have customers find our full-service offering. And a lot of it also has to do with what I mentioned earlier, which is local marketing. If I'm in San Diego, if I'm in Kansas City, even if I see that TurboTax can provide experts, I go to start to see locally if there's somebody there. Well, all of our experts that we have are within 10 miles of many of the households in the United States, but we've never marketed that way. And so that's going to inform our marketing going forward. So there's a lot that we learned in terms of how to evolve our marketing, so it becomes an and, and not an either/or, and we're excited about it.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much. Sasan, I'd love to hear you just give a little bit more detail on what you're counting on Mailchimp to do this year and maybe not if you don't want to get too much into the quantitative side. Qualitatively, you guys have done a lot of work around the product, the monetizaiton. How important is sort of a continued acceleration of Mailchimp as you look at sort of the small business in aggregate for next year? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Kirk, thank you for your question. It's really -- to answer your question, it's really threefold. First and foremost, as you know, we made this acquisition ultimately to create one growth platform, so we can help a small business in one place, be able to grow their business and manage their cash flow and manage their workforce all in one place. And really the key to all of this has been data, AI and now our accelerated investments in GenAI. And so first and foremost is we want to make significant progress in this area, and you'll actually see some of this on both September 6, our Intuit Innovation Day and at Investor Day. That's number one. The second is, as I mentioned earlier, we had the largest release in June that we've ever had in Mailchimp's history. We had 150 new and updated features that we released on top of the multiple GenAI-driven announcements that we had made a couple of weeks prior to that. So our second focus is adoption, getting our customers to adopt these benefits because not only will it help fuel their success, but it will help us with monetization, particularly in the mid-market, which is where our focus is very similar to the focus that we've had with QuickBooks' mid-market. And then third is international. Mailchimp is the lead horse internationally. And we've done a lot to localize the product. I mentioned earlier in the five languages and more is coming. We've also been doing a lot of price studies and price testing because we've had like one class price internationally. That doesn't work. Some countries should be higher, some countries should be lower. And so we've learned a lot in terms of some of our testing and many of that we're going to be scaling this year. So those are -- if I were to just sort of carve out your question, those are the three big areas that we are very focused on in the coming years.\nKirk Materne: Great. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nNick Giovacchini: Hi, everyone. It\u2019s Nick Giovacchini on for Brad this evening. Congratulations on the strong end to the year, and welcome, Sandeep. I appreciate you taking the question. International growth has decelerated since the beginning of the year. Can you talk us through how you see that growing going forward? Thanks.\nSandeep Aujla: Thanks for the question, Nick. A couple of things on the international growth. On international growth, as I shared earlier, our focus, our refreshed strategy is to lead with both Mailchimp and QuickBooks in the markets where we have product market fit. And in other areas to lead with Mailchimp at the tip of the spear. Our growth decelerated for a couple of reasons, and some of that Sasan shared. As we lead into rightsizing the pricing for Mailchimp in some of these geographies, historically, it was the same price. It was basically the price in the US simply converting into the local currency and applied in that geography. We went in, and we looked at what the price should be based on the competitors in the market, based on the GDP per capital and all these other factors and we rightsized the price. Secondly, as we do in QuickBooks, we introduced free trials or discounts initially when folks join the product is what we have experienced over our years of doing that is people -- more people come into the product and they stick around. That leads to a better 90-day forwarded retention, et cetera. These are all the factors and all the improvements we're making in the Mailchimp product and the lineup, which is leading to what I would describe as a temporary headwind in terms of our international growth.\nNick Giovacchini: Great. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a really nice and prudent guidance methodology for next year. I guess maybe I'll just -- I want both of my questions to really target the SMB growth rate. It seems like the guide there ex Mailchimp is really strong. Sandeep you're now in the CFO seat, maybe just talk about -- you talked about the prudence intact, but the prudence in the SMB guide, what gives you guys the confidence to kind of guide that way? How much of it has to do with some of the payment functionalities that are coming to market, some of the GenAI functionality that's coming to market, what gives you guys that guidance? And then dovetailing into that, new leadership for that group, obviously, as well. Is there talk about the potential for either disruption or how is that accounted for? Or why Mariana was the right fit for that role specifically and kind of where -- what you're going to bring to the table in?\nSasan Goodarzi: Alex, can I take the leadership question and take it more broadly and then let Sandeep jump in and answer specifically your question around the guide. Let me take this opportunity to talk about the leadership changes that we've had in the company. And I'll, of course, include Mariana in that as well. First of all, one of our greatest superpowers as a company is leadership development and succession planning. One of the focus areas that we have as part of our Intuit operating system, which starts at the top with my staff and staff is we spend four times a year, several days at a time, focusing on talent, focusing on succession planning, reviewing development plans and being very intentional about architecting mobility moves. And ultimately, our goal is to be 3D in all of our key roles at multiple levels in the company, which, by the way, is very hard to do. But that is why we are a leadership factory. The second thing I would say is that we are very focused on mobility of senior roles, so the Vice President and above, which is an officer of the company and above, typically within a three- to five-year period, there's a lot of it -- you don't have visibility to, of course, because you only see potential changes that happen in my staff. But we're very intentional about mobility because we believe fresh perspective, fresh thinking is important in our technology areas and our businesses and also training the leaders to be ready for a bigger job is very important. By the way, I'll use myself as an example. Before I stepped into the CEO job 4.5 years ago, I was in TurboTax for three years. I was in QuickBook -- running Small Business for three years when I was the CIO for two years. So that's just an example of mobility. With all of that said, sometimes our mobility is up and to the right and changes within the company. Sometimes we celebrate folks taking on roles outside of the company because that may be the best fit for them. So with that as context, we have a lot of confidence in our leaders, and let me now specifically touch on our three of the leaders just to make it very real. When you look at Mariana, I actually hired Mariana into Small Business when I was there. She was our Chief Product Development Officer and is very familiar with Small Business. When I became the CEO, I moved her into the CEO role, and she's done an unbelievable job fueling innovation across the company. And now she's going back home to where she started running Small Business. And very excited about what she will do to unlock the next year of growth. When you look at Mark in TurboTax, I actually started with Mark in TurboTax a decade ago. and worked with him for three years. We then -- after I left TurboTax a few years later, promoted him to be our Chief Customer Success Officer of the company. And he is the godfather of our live platform that we talk a lot about today. And now he's going back home and running TurboTax. So he's very well versed not only in the business, but our disruptive growth driver of the future, which is live. And then Alex Balazs, just upon our CTO role, I also worked with him in TurboTax. We then move them to a broader Chief Architect and data role, where he's been Mariana's right-hand person, fueling the innovation across the company. We just moved him into the CTO role. The reason I wanted to go through that a bit fairly is for all of you to understand that succession planning and leadership development is our sort of core competency. And I actually believe that we have the strongest team that we've had ever built for the era of AI given their backgrounds and experiences. So with that as context, let me have Sandeep answer the other part of your question, Alex.\nSandeep Aujla: Absolutely. And actually, let me touch on one additional point to what Sasan added, it's never about one individual. We are a system, and we have strong leadership teams around our General Manager and CFO staff as well. So getting back to your question on the guidance, Alex. So just for context, the Small Business group grew 24% in fiscal '23, with four of those points coming from the benefit of the timing of the Mailchimp acquisition. So that's about a 20% organic run rate. And as we have shared with you with -- the group in the past is 80% of the revenues in the Small Business group are subscription-based. So that makes -- so the recurring nature of the revenue makes it highly predictable. And we -- this year's strong results in areas where we are focused, such as QuickBooks Advanced customer growth as well as in the mid-market area that Sasan touched on. So that is one component giving us confidence as we guide for next year. The second aspect is it's the importance of our products to SMBs. This is something core to how they run their business, how they pay their employees, how they get paid themselves, how they get access to capital to take on new projects and grow their business. And we have made tremendous improvements in our product in an ecosystem that makes that platform that much more relevant and important to the lives of our customers. So that is what's all baked into the guidance that we provided for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. You asked a question if we were reliant on GenAI. I want to reiterate and be very clear. GenAI, we believe it will be an accelerator for our business, but that is not baked into the guidance that we shared with you all today.\nAlex Zukin: Super clear. Thanks a lot, Sandeep and Sasan. It was very in-depth explanation. No doubt the talent factory is alive and well.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig in on Credit Karma, specifically as it relates to the opportunity to begin to pursue prime customers in addition to the subprime and near-prime customers you guys have kind of focused on historically? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your question. Yes, it's a big focus area for us going after prime customers. And just for context, it's sort of a third of our monthly active users, and they're the least engaged because really, when you look at the platform, we traditionally focused on subprime and near prime. And we have a lot of the capabilities that we've developed in the past and know these prime customers very well, which is why we have merged our Mint and Credit Karma team and platform to really solve for these prime customers. And so we have been working, I think, for the last almost a year, really understanding their needs, running a number of experiments and are now -- and has been in the midst of launching multiple things that are very geared towards prime customers. And we're actually very excited with the app redesign. There's sort of two big things that we've been working on in Credit Karma beyond what we've been sharing with you. One is really redesigning the whole app to enable customers and certain cohort of customers like Prime to be able to find the benefit that they're looking for because of everything that we know about them proactively. The second is the GenAI experience is that, again, we will unveil more of September 6. And the combination of those two things and what I shared a moment ago around Prime customers gives us a lot of sort of excitement around what's possible to serve these Prime customers going forward, which is something that we've not benefited from a monetization perspective. None of that is included in our guidance, but it's something that we're very excited about.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the insight. Looking forward to learning more about it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yep. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on AI here as well. It sounds like some exciting things coming, looking forward to learning more about that. A lot of possibilities here within Small Business and Consumer. Would just love to get your perspective on kind of where you're coming from? Sasan, you've alluded to the fact that Intuit is well prepared here because of the platform capabilities here and the underpinnings of that with data. So just curious, any color as to where Intuit is coming from such that you're able to iterate on AI the way that we're looking forward to learning more about.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for your question. I'll start with taking you back to five years ago when we declared our strategy was to really shift the company from just a tax and accounting platform, which is a very important set of problems to solve for customers to a global financial platform that really played a far more meaningful role in powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses on a daily basis. When we made that strategic declaration on the five bets that ensued, what we talked about at that time was that data and AI was going to be core to making that shift. And in fact, when we made the acquisition of both Credit Karma and Mailchimp, one huge driver of the acquisition was around the data, because in essence, we will know a lot more about customers, and we could leverage that data for their benefit to fuel their success. So -- and even five years ago declaring this, data and machine learning has been a decade-long focus of Intuit. So when you think about a decade-long investment in data usable data, cleaning the data and making sure that it's structured in a way where it can be used and then our investments in AI, specifically in knowledge engineering, which really takes rules and the relationship between data and turns it in the code is what our advantages in TurboTax, machine learning and natural language processing, those have been -- it's been a decade-long set of investments and the two acquisitions have propelled us forward about 10 years. And then you couple that with what we started several years ago, which is GenAI. And then what we launched in June, which is Generative Operating System, GenOS, which by the way, is not something you can create overnight. This is years of investment. When we couple those kind of investments, data, AI and GenOS, which is really primarily our own Intuit financial large language models that are trained on our customers' proprietary data, it allows us to personalize things, humanize things and do the work for customers in a way that's revolutionary, which ultimately gets to the punch line of we are creating a future that is done for you. Rather than you having to do the work to run your business, rather than you have to do the work to be able to power your prosperity, manage your finances as a consumer, we want to put you in control where it's done for you. You're always in control, you have the taste of whether or not you move forward with a decision. But we want to be able to help you grow your customers and run your business for you and help you manage your cash flow, always put the right choices in front of you. And the same thing goes on the tax side and Credit Karma side. So that's what's so exciting about -- it's a decade-long focus. We really tripled down on it five years ago when we declared our strategy. And we're -- we have now galvanized and energized the entire company that the [future of done for you] (ph) that we declared five years ago is very real, very much here. And we had an enormous opportunity to do amazing things for our customers. And that's what really gets us excited about what's possible. And so I can do another advertisement, join us September 6 for Intuit's Innovation Day, followed by Investor Day, and you'll get a real good feel for the world that we are going to create for the future.\nBrad Sills: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Welcome Sandeep. And good afternoon, Sasan. The -- I have a couple on consumer, one very high level and one, just a clarification. So the first is on...\nSasan Goodarzi: Scott, you cut out on us.\nKim Watkins: Raiza, can you try to bring him back?\nOperator: Thanks, Scott. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Sasan, can you hear me?\nSasan Goodarzi: We can now. Yes, if you don't mind start over again, we lost you.\nScott Schneeberger: Absolutely. Thanks. So two quick on consumer. First, volume and price mix. Just your consideration of that going into fiscal 2024 and beyond given the trends of the recent years? And then for you or Sandeep, just curious in the extension season in the post-tax season, what did you see? Anything interesting with California? Should we see a shift from fiscal '23 to '24 that's material related to anything extension wise? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Let me start with your volume mix question around TurboTax. I would say the way to think about it was what I described earlier, leaning into full service, leaning into business tax and continue to lean into TurboTax Live, which really comes with assistance, recognizing it's all data and AI driven. You're going to see more come from ARPC than volume, and that's just the nature of the opportunity. Now there is 88 million-plus people that are in the assisted segment and there's $30 billion of spend. So there's both a volume opportunity and an ARPC opportunity. Just our view, looking at the next 10 years, by the way, this is not a one-year answer, both matter, you're going to get -- we're going to get more from ARPC. And I'll let Sandeep jump in here as well. I mean on the extension season, that's just been very weird with many states that got extended to July and California to October and what we're seeing from customers is they're even gotten confused which month they have to file in their state. So net-net is there's more to file. When you look at it at the company level, it's really not material, but not everybody has filed yet.\nSandeep Aujla: And that\u2019s -- that's basically the answer, Scott. It's not material for our Q1. It's been a unique behavior on the taxpayer. But I'll also remind us that last year, we also saw a great deal of extensions by taxpayers. So that's also something to keep in mind as you look at Q1.\nScott Schneeberger: Thank you, both.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right, everybody. I think that brings our questions or Q&A to an end. So thank you for your wonderful questions. Thank you for spending the time with us. We look forward to seeing you September 6 and -- at our Investor Day. Take good care. Be safe. Bye, everybody.\nSandeep Aujla: Thank you, all.\nKim Watkins: Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

            "content": "Thank you, Sasan. I'm excited to be here and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2023, including total revenue growth of 13%, strong margin expansion, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% and 22% respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered results that exceeded the high-end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $2.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $17 million versus a loss of $75 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $627 million versus $433 million last year up 45%. GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $0.32 versus a loss of $0.20 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.65 versus $1.10 last year, up 50%. Now turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 24% for the full year, which included four points of benefit from a full year of Mailchimp's revenue this year versus three quarters last year. Online ecosystem revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 30% for the full year. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in Q4 and 26% in fiscal '23. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year were driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shifts. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services grew 20% in Q4 driven by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. For the full fiscal year, '23 QuickBooks Online Services grew 34% driven by Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in this quarter reflects an increase in customers' adopting our payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue grew mid-teens in Q4. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offering to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q4 and 31% in fiscal '23. The power of our small business platform continues to resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow across all types of economic environments. Our platform remains critical to our customers' success and we continue to see them adopt multiple offerings across the platform to manage their business. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low 20s. We are approximately two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remained on license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. We also raised our desktop prices across multiple products last September, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue building out our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth of 15% to 20% per year in long term. Now shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $424 million in Q4, down 11%. On a product basis, the decline in Q4 was driven primarily by macroeconomic headwinds in personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. Full year revenue was $1.6 billion down 9%. Credit Karma represented 11% of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal '23. We have seen continued stability across our core verticals, which led to the improvement in year-over-year performance during Q4 versus Q3. For context, credit cards and personal loans represented nearly 50% and nearly 30% of Credit Karma's revenue in fiscal '23, respectively. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Credit Karma annual revenue growth of 20% to 25% per year long term. Now shifting to Consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $4.1 billion in fiscal '23, up 6%. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, introducing volatility into Consumer Group results. However, average annual trends over this four-year period are more in line with the long-term trends. Over the past four years, Consumer Group revenue increased by an average of 10% annually, which aligns with our long-term growth expectations of 8% to 12%. While this was a unique tax season, I am proud of the progress the team made by transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live, which grew revenues 17% this year, while customers grew 12%. Looking ahead, we are confident in multiple growth drivers. First, we see a large runway ahead of us with TurboTax Live, given our ability to use both GenAI and human experts powered by AI to deliver confidence for our customers. We are investing in scaling our full-service offering, which has a good product market fit based on the highest product recommendation scores of any product at Intuit this year. Second, we are trying to scale our business tax offering, following a successful pilot this year. And third, we see significant opportunities ahead, driving Credit Karma members to TurboTax and giving TurboTax filers faster access to their money with Credit Karma Money. Given the growth opportunities I just shared, we continue to expect annual Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% per year over the long term. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $561 million in fiscal '23, up 3%. Now let me share more on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. Approximately $4.2 billion of the debt is maturing over the next 15 months and we are evaluating refinancing opportunities subject to market and other conditions. We repurchased $465 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2 billion during fiscal '23. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim to be -- is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share payable on October 17, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We recently finalized our three and one year strategic plan. I feel confident in the investments we are making to drive durable growth, including executing across our Big Bet and continuing the accelerated pace of innovation, particularly with GenAI. We have a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. We manage for the short and the long-term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2024 guidance includes total company revenue of $15.89 billion to $16.105 billion, a growth of 11% to 12%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and a decline of 3% to a growth of 3% for Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $9.37 to $9.67, growth of 11% to 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $16.17 to $16.47 growth of 12% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2024. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.21, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 to $2. We are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '24, we expect to pay approximately $700 million in cash tax payments related to fiscal '23, which were deferred due to the IRS disaster-area tax relief. You can find a full fiscal 2024 and Q1 guidance details in our press release as well as on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Sasan. Thanks for the question, Michael. And let me unpack it a little bit. We go through a [indiscernible] planning process, as I shared in the prepared remarks. And due that process, if you look at one of the biggest needle movers to deliver growth both in the near term and the long term, so durable growth levers for the company. And we make sure those are funded for success, inclusive of Big Bets and investments in GenAI. So the 40 to 60 bps of guidance reflects those investments and, quite frankly, reflects the strength and resilience of our platform. As a reminder, this is an expansion we're delivering on top of the 3.5 points of expansion we delivered over the last three years. As I look ahead, I see plenty of runway for us to continue to operate in accordance with our financial principles to grow expenses slower than revenue, therefore, implying a margin expansion. And really, as I look at it, what gives me confidence is that we are an AI-driven expert platform, and we operate as an ecosystem across technology, across customer success, across marketing. So in addition to giving us a competitive advantage for having faster time to market as a -- from opting as an ecosystem, it also gives us advantage in getting operating leverage as we scale as a business. And Taylor, I would add, over the long term, we remain committed to our growth algorithm of 10% to 20% ARPC and customer growth. That remains unchanged. And really, as Sasan mentioned, is our innovation across our platform that gives us -- opens up the aperture for us to cross-sell and upsell our customers across more offerings on our platform as those opportunities for us to price for value as we look ahead. And Brad, the one thing I would add to this because you asked about a scenario in which interest rates are higher. When interest rates are higher, the consumer have a higher propensity to shop around because even a small improvement in the rates that they're getting, has a bigger difference in terms of the interest rate they're paying and a bigger difference to their bottom line. So in fact, the product becomes more important critical to the end user in a higher rate environment. Thanks for the question, Nick. A couple of things on the international growth. On international growth, as I shared earlier, our focus, our refreshed strategy is to lead with both Mailchimp and QuickBooks in the markets where we have product market fit. And in other areas to lead with Mailchimp at the tip of the spear. Our growth decelerated for a couple of reasons, and some of that Sasan shared. As we lead into rightsizing the pricing for Mailchimp in some of these geographies, historically, it was the same price. It was basically the price in the US simply converting into the local currency and applied in that geography. We went in, and we looked at what the price should be based on the competitors in the market, based on the GDP per capital and all these other factors and we rightsized the price. Secondly, as we do in QuickBooks, we introduced free trials or discounts initially when folks join the product is what we have experienced over our years of doing that is people -- more people come into the product and they stick around. That leads to a better 90-day forwarded retention, et cetera. These are all the factors and all the improvements we're making in the Mailchimp product and the lineup, which is leading to what I would describe as a temporary headwind in terms of our international growth. Absolutely. And actually, let me touch on one additional point to what Sasan added, it's never about one individual. We are a system, and we have strong leadership teams around our General Manager and CFO staff as well. So getting back to your question on the guidance, Alex. So just for context, the Small Business group grew 24% in fiscal '23, with four of those points coming from the benefit of the timing of the Mailchimp acquisition. So that's about a 20% organic run rate. And as we have shared with you with -- the group in the past is 80% of the revenues in the Small Business group are subscription-based. So that makes -- so the recurring nature of the revenue makes it highly predictable. And we -- this year's strong results in areas where we are focused, such as QuickBooks Advanced customer growth as well as in the mid-market area that Sasan touched on. So that is one component giving us confidence as we guide for next year. The second aspect is it's the importance of our products to SMBs. This is something core to how they run their business, how they pay their employees, how they get paid themselves, how they get access to capital to take on new projects and grow their business. And we have made tremendous improvements in our product in an ecosystem that makes that platform that much more relevant and important to the lives of our customers. So that is what's all baked into the guidance that we provided for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. You asked a question if we were reliant on GenAI. I want to reiterate and be very clear. GenAI, we believe it will be an accelerator for our business, but that is not baked into the guidance that we shared with you all today. And that's -- that's basically the answer, Scott. It's not material for our Q1. It's been a unique behavior on the taxpayer. But I'll also remind us that last year, we also saw a great deal of extensions by taxpayers. So that's also something to keep in mind as you look at Q1. Thank you, all."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "All right. Excellent, Kim, thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We grew full year revenue 13%, delivered strong operating margin expansion, and exited the year with momentum. Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our platform and the diversity of our portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times. This past year, we expanded our operating margin again, while investing in the most important areas to drive durable long-term growth. We are guiding to another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2024, even with the macroeconomic environment that is uncertain. We are entering Intuit's most exciting area. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core fueling innovation across our five Big Bets. We've made strong progress in transforming from a tax and accounting platform where consumers and small businesses have to do the work to achieve the benefit that they are seeking, to a global financial platform, where we do the hard work for them. Now, we are creating a future of, done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers to fuel their financial success. This future is only possible because of our history of significant investments in our platform, talent, data and AI and now our accelerated investments in generative AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for 100 million customers. For small businesses, we have a 360-degree view of their business and customers. We have 500,000 customers and financial attributes per small business on our platform and this data gives us insights into behaviors, income streams, expenses, profitability, and cash flows, enabling us to provide personalized experiences and recommendations to help them prosper. Additionally, we have 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform, including income, expenses, credit history, spending history, outstanding loans, cash flow, and tax information, which enables us to become a financial assistant in their pocket. We are using our data to fine-tune our own financial large language models that specialize in solving tax, accounting, cash flow, marketing, and personal finance challenges. The investments that we've made in data and AI over the years allow us to introduce innovations at an accelerated rate. Intuit's rich data platform is a powerful foundation that allows us to create innovative AI-assisted experiences for all of our customers powering their prosperity. In June, we introduced our generative AI operating system called GenOS, to ignite innovation at scale for the benefit of millions of consumers and small businesses. GenOS empowers Intuit technologists to create breakthrough generative AI experiences. We are using a platform approach, giving our teams across Intuit the resources and tools they need to design, build, test and deploy these new experiences with unparalleled speed. This includes our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers, in a cost-effective way. We are entering Intuit's most exciting era yet and believe the next several years will be game changing. On September 6th, we'll be hosting Intuit Innovation Day, a virtual event where we will unveil exciting GenAI innovation across our platform and how it will drive business growth in the years ahead. We look forward to sharing more with you then. Now, let me turn to our Big Bets which are driving growth and benefits for our customers today. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress in one of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are, revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and getting paid upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 22% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 80% of businesses still pay other firms via paper checks. We recently expanded the availability of the beta of our native bill pay solution by 10x. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end QuickBooks and Mailchimp customer growth platform. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite. And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This last quarter, we implemented our first generative AI capability in Mailchimp, the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. This quarter, we launched the beta of a new product announcement generator, which uses AI to automatically create an email that a small business can send to its customers. We also announced over 150 new and updated features at our recent Mailchimp conference in London, designed to support the needs of advanced marketers, including a calendar view, custom reporting and analytics, more e-commerce advanced segmentation, more real time behavioral data based on e-commerce automations, and SMS marketing. Lineup changes and free trials are driving positive trends in year-over-year paid customer growth, which accelerated this quarter. We continue to make progress in mid-market, our 90-day retention rate this quarter the highest it's been in two years. We have also translated the product into five different languages. We will share more on the outcomes we're delivering across our five Big Bets at our Investor Day. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our products, we are moving at high velocity. This will help us put more money in our customers' pockets, save them time, and ensure complete confidence in every financial decision they make. As we lead this next technological shift, we are well positioned to power prosperity for our customers and communities that we serve with a leadership team that is built for the era of AI. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. It's great to have you on the call, my friend. Great. Thank you. And wrapping up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our five Big Bets, the investments that we are making in GenAI and our leadership team driving our platform innovation. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. In today's uncertain macro-environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and mission-critical than ever to our customers. I look forward to your attendance at our Intuit Innovation Day on September 6th, and Investor Day on September 28th. With that, let's open it up to your questions. Hey, Keith, thank you for your question. Let me give you the headline, but allow me to unpack it. I think the headline is we are just simply being prudent. Our focus on future growth and our bullishness does not change at all. Let me unpack that. First and foremost, when you look at the assisted segment, there is a $30 billion TAM, and $20 billion of it is consumer-assisted segment and $10 billion of it is business segment. And the second is the secular shift towards digitization will continue and only accelerate in the years to come. And with that as context, we probably saw some of our biggest green shoots this year, which is why we are probably more bullish about what's possible in this business than we were even three to four years ago, and I would put it in two buckets, Credit Karma and then the assisted segment. In Credit Karma, just as a reminder, our vision from the moment that we bought Credit Karma was to create one consumer platform where a consumer can manage their financial lives, manage their money, and get their taxes done in one place. After several years of just rapid experimentation, we had a massive breakthrough this past year where our customer growth within the Credit Karma platform versus a number of Credit Karma members who became TurboTax customers was up 5x and we are scaling that both on the product side and on the business model side as that gives us a lot of confidence going into next year and beyond. The second is going to be assisted segment and that's in three parts. First and foremost is we actually had product market fit this past year at full service, our biggest focus was how do we scale. We had some breakthroughs in how to scale. In fact, as you heard from Sandeep, we had our best product recommendations score of any product across the company and we are significantly leaning into that in the coming year. The second is business tax. We launched and learned to get the product market fit in business tax. That is not going to be available, both across our QuickBooks Live platform and directly going to market with TurboTax and we have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, will come to TurboTax looking for business tax. We've never had an offering. We will next year and we are scaling it. The last thing, I would say in the assisted segment, one of the biggest things that we've learned in the last year is local matters. What that means, people will go on Google, and they will search, if I'm in San Diego is there a pro close to me, while we've never been good been found and local and in fact, when you look at the experts that we have, we are 10 miles from every home in household in the United States and so we're going big on local this year. And so when I look at our green shoots in the assisted segment and in Credit Karma, it gives us a lot of confidence as we look at this coming year and the future and I'll end with where I started, was the essence of your question about our guidance, we're simply being prudent given the year that we just had. Thank you. Yeah, Siti, thank you for your question. Let me take it in two parts. First and foremost, you've heard us in the past year plus talk about digitizing B2B with respect to all of the manual work that gets done today in terms of 80% of the back and forth between small businesses is all sort of paper checks and manual. And our goal has been to digitize all of that. And one last element of what we needed to do was to launch bill pay. I think the headline I would just give is -- the feedback we've been getting has even gone better than what we thought, and we're now at a place where we are 10x-ing our beta, and we hope to have it available to all of our customers soon. So we feel very good about what we are seeing in Bill Pay and how fast we're able to build it based on the platform capabilities that we have and the feedback that we've gotten from customers. I think back to your second question, you're right. And in fact, the vision I would take you back to is that we have set out to be the source of truth for a business and to truly be the center of small business growth. And in order to do that, we have to have capabilities that not only help a small business grow their customers, retain their customers, market to their customers, but to be able to manage their cash flow and be able to manage their employees. We now have all of those capabilities end-to-end. And I think particularly, what's important, that advantages us to deliver for our customers is the data and our AI investments that we've made in the last five-plus years. And I think I would just encourage you to attend -- and if you can attend when it's on real time, watch the replay of our September 6 Intuit Innovation Day. And you will see how with our data, AI and GenAI capabilities we help customers manage their cash flow and really digitize all of money movement in a way that's so intuitive, so easy and delivered at a moment of truth. So we're quite excited about what's possible as we look at this coming year, about the years ahead. And let me, by the way, be very explicit that none of our potential innovation that you're going to experience in September 6 around GenAI is included in our guidance. But we believe it is fundamentally revolutionary as we think about the world we're going to create in the future. You're very welcome. Sure. Great question. Well, first of all, I'll just take you back to what you already know, but I think it's important that we start there. This past year, IRS returns, we continue to estimate we'll be down a couple of points. The do-it-yourself category will be down nearly 1 point. And the driver of that, which we are now certain of, based on all the working analysis that we've done, is we had a number of folks that came in to get their stimulus dollars and tax credits, and so it was pandemic driven. And so that created just what you heard from Sandeep, a sort of a very unusual tax season. But then when you step back and look at the last four-year trend, it sort of straightened out. And so what we mean by prudent is really a couple of things. One, we're not assuming IRS growth in our numbers this year, and we're not banking on all of the innovation that I just shared paying off this coming year. And that's just part of us being prudent because we want to demonstrate to all of you that this is a business that grows 8% to 12%. And by doing so, we must deliver the results. And so it's just being very intentional and very prudent. As we think about, by the way, our guidance holistically, it's not just TurboTax, it's TurboTax, it's Credit Karma and the way we thought about Small Business. But those are -- that's the sort of the definition of what we mean by prudent. Yeah. You're very welcome. Yeah. Thank you for your questions. Let me start us off and Sandeep, please jump in if you want to add anything. First of all, we have a framework at the company level where we want to drive the majority of our growth from volume and mix and the lesser part from price, but we always focus on pricing for value. And so when we look at our growth drivers this year, it is coming from customer growth, and it is coming from mix and to a lesser extent this year compared to last year, by the way, from price. With that as context, I would just remind you that the big picture, when you look at our opportunity this coming year, but even in the next three to five years plus, we now have a platform and a portfolio of services where we have the opportunity to drive further adoption of our services from Mailchimp to payments, to payroll to time tracking and to a lot of our new innovations around Bill Pay and digitizing B2B that I just mentioned. But also, although we are three to four years in, we're just at the beginning of what's possible in the midmarket. Big market is a significant ARPC opportunity because these customers use a lot of the capabilities that I just mentioned, except they pay a lot more. And we're just at the beginning of the flywheel of penetrating mid-market. So when you look at the portfolio of the services that we have, the strength of the experience that we're delivering because of data and AI and because of mid-market, it allows us to drive most of our growth from customer growth and mix. And none of that, by the way, takes into account what's possible as we look into the future with our generative AI experiences that you'll be able to observe on September 6. But those are the main drivers. Very welcome. Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. And you're loud and clear, my friend. So let me start with Small Business. And generally, I would just lead with they continue to be healthy, but they're challenged in this environment. The specifics that I would share is the cash flow -- cash reserves of Small Businesses is 90% of what it was this time last year. However, it is still stronger than pre-pandemic. The -- in terms of looking for labor and finding employees to drive their growth, that's still quite strong. And in fact, in this environment, Small Businesses are able to do a better job finding what they need versus when the market was hot, which is good for them because then they can deliver for their customers and drive growth. And the last thing I would just say is there are certain sectors that are very weak, transportation, real estate, advertising, is very weak within small businesses. So that's the aggregate picture. I'll end with what where I started, struggling, but still healthy compared to pre-pandemic. On the consumer side, let me hit on sort of two different points. I'll quickly hit on Credit Karma. As you know, Sandeep mentioned, what we're seeing is stability and our innovation that we've been focused on is really getting hold, and there's some exciting things that we're working on in Credit Karma that we'll share both on September 6 and at Investor Day, one where we redesigned the entire app. And we have begun to roll it out to a small cohort of customers and will eventually scale it. And we're actually seeing very good engagement with the redesigned app. And then that, coupled with our GenAI experiences, along with all of our innovation with Lightbox and Credit Karma Money gives us a lot of excitement around the future, none of which, by the way, is in our guidance. But the headline is stability in Credit Karma and lots of innovation that is helping us with where we are and coming. If I just focus on the consumer, a couple of things I would say. If you look back to last March of 2022, credit scores are, on average, down 13 points. Credit balances are up about 30%. And the credit band of like [600 to 660] (ph) have the largest balances. They're carrying about $10,000 on average. And the Gen Z balances have gone up the most, are up 45% year-over-year. So job market is still good. People still have jobs, but there's certainly some level of strain on the consumer. Very welcome. Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're very bullish on the business. And in fact, a couple of things that I would share with you, which we can talk more about at Investor Day, but just not to leave you hanging, the monetization model in Credit Karma is how many members you have, how frequently they engage. And there's a model for -- every time a customer engages, there is a average revenue per customer that we benefit from. And in fact, this past year, in '23, when our results were down year-over-year, our frequency of engagement is actually higher than the prior two years where we had 37% growth and 58% growth. Now why is that? It's because of all of our innovation. It's because the customer is engaging but in many areas, credit is still tight. So when credit begins to open up, and that's the stability that we're seeing now, we view this business will accelerate back to the 20% to 25% growth rate. Plus I'll remind you that, that plus the integration with TurboTax drives actually more stickiness, more monetization and truly created this one consumer platform, which was our vision from day one when we acquired Credit Karma. And with all of the data and AI capabilities that we have in our accelerated GenAI experiences, as I said earlier, you're going to see on September 6, some of the new innovations that are coming that will make it easier for customers to find what they need, the benefits that they need to engage in the financial products that they want and manage their money. And so all of that leads to our view is completely unchanged relative to the long-term expectations of 20% to 25% growth in Credit Karma. Very welcome. Yeah. Great question. Let me give you an answer that I think you'll find somewhat helpful and somewhat vague intentionally. We learned a lot this year. We came into the year with a full service offering that has product markets, that as you know, it's all AI-driven. And we can virtually get things done within an hour or same day. We learned a lot around health and scaling and how to have customers find our full-service offering. And a lot of it also has to do with what I mentioned earlier, which is local marketing. If I'm in San Diego, if I'm in Kansas City, even if I see that TurboTax can provide experts, I go to start to see locally if there's somebody there. Well, all of our experts that we have are within 10 miles of many of the households in the United States, but we've never marketed that way. And so that's going to inform our marketing going forward. So there's a lot that we learned in terms of how to evolve our marketing, so it becomes an and, and not an either/or, and we're excited about it. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah, Kirk, thank you for your question. It's really -- to answer your question, it's really threefold. First and foremost, as you know, we made this acquisition ultimately to create one growth platform, so we can help a small business in one place, be able to grow their business and manage their cash flow and manage their workforce all in one place. And really the key to all of this has been data, AI and now our accelerated investments in GenAI. And so first and foremost is we want to make significant progress in this area, and you'll actually see some of this on both September 6, our Intuit Innovation Day and at Investor Day. That's number one. The second is, as I mentioned earlier, we had the largest release in June that we've ever had in Mailchimp's history. We had 150 new and updated features that we released on top of the multiple GenAI-driven announcements that we had made a couple of weeks prior to that. So our second focus is adoption, getting our customers to adopt these benefits because not only will it help fuel their success, but it will help us with monetization, particularly in the mid-market, which is where our focus is very similar to the focus that we've had with QuickBooks' mid-market. And then third is international. Mailchimp is the lead horse internationally. And we've done a lot to localize the product. I mentioned earlier in the five languages and more is coming. We've also been doing a lot of price studies and price testing because we've had like one class price internationally. That doesn't work. Some countries should be higher, some countries should be lower. And so we've learned a lot in terms of some of our testing and many of that we're going to be scaling this year. So those are -- if I were to just sort of carve out your question, those are the three big areas that we are very focused on in the coming years. Yeah. You're welcome. Very welcome. Alex, can I take the leadership question and take it more broadly and then let Sandeep jump in and answer specifically your question around the guide. Let me take this opportunity to talk about the leadership changes that we've had in the company. And I'll, of course, include Mariana in that as well. First of all, one of our greatest superpowers as a company is leadership development and succession planning. One of the focus areas that we have as part of our Intuit operating system, which starts at the top with my staff and staff is we spend four times a year, several days at a time, focusing on talent, focusing on succession planning, reviewing development plans and being very intentional about architecting mobility moves. And ultimately, our goal is to be 3D in all of our key roles at multiple levels in the company, which, by the way, is very hard to do. But that is why we are a leadership factory. The second thing I would say is that we are very focused on mobility of senior roles, so the Vice President and above, which is an officer of the company and above, typically within a three- to five-year period, there's a lot of it -- you don't have visibility to, of course, because you only see potential changes that happen in my staff. But we're very intentional about mobility because we believe fresh perspective, fresh thinking is important in our technology areas and our businesses and also training the leaders to be ready for a bigger job is very important. By the way, I'll use myself as an example. Before I stepped into the CEO job 4.5 years ago, I was in TurboTax for three years. I was in QuickBook -- running Small Business for three years when I was the CIO for two years. So that's just an example of mobility. With all of that said, sometimes our mobility is up and to the right and changes within the company. Sometimes we celebrate folks taking on roles outside of the company because that may be the best fit for them. So with that as context, we have a lot of confidence in our leaders, and let me now specifically touch on our three of the leaders just to make it very real. When you look at Mariana, I actually hired Mariana into Small Business when I was there. She was our Chief Product Development Officer and is very familiar with Small Business. When I became the CEO, I moved her into the CEO role, and she's done an unbelievable job fueling innovation across the company. And now she's going back home to where she started running Small Business. And very excited about what she will do to unlock the next year of growth. When you look at Mark in TurboTax, I actually started with Mark in TurboTax a decade ago. and worked with him for three years. We then -- after I left TurboTax a few years later, promoted him to be our Chief Customer Success Officer of the company. And he is the godfather of our live platform that we talk a lot about today. And now he's going back home and running TurboTax. So he's very well versed not only in the business, but our disruptive growth driver of the future, which is live. And then Alex Balazs, just upon our CTO role, I also worked with him in TurboTax. We then move them to a broader Chief Architect and data role, where he's been Mariana's right-hand person, fueling the innovation across the company. We just moved him into the CTO role. The reason I wanted to go through that a bit fairly is for all of you to understand that succession planning and leadership development is our sort of core competency. And I actually believe that we have the strongest team that we've had ever built for the era of AI given their backgrounds and experiences. So with that as context, let me have Sandeep answer the other part of your question, Alex. Thank you, Alex. Yeah. Thank you for your question. Yes, it's a big focus area for us going after prime customers. And just for context, it's sort of a third of our monthly active users, and they're the least engaged because really, when you look at the platform, we traditionally focused on subprime and near prime. And we have a lot of the capabilities that we've developed in the past and know these prime customers very well, which is why we have merged our Mint and Credit Karma team and platform to really solve for these prime customers. And so we have been working, I think, for the last almost a year, really understanding their needs, running a number of experiments and are now -- and has been in the midst of launching multiple things that are very geared towards prime customers. And we're actually very excited with the app redesign. There's sort of two big things that we've been working on in Credit Karma beyond what we've been sharing with you. One is really redesigning the whole app to enable customers and certain cohort of customers like Prime to be able to find the benefit that they're looking for because of everything that we know about them proactively. The second is the GenAI experience is that, again, we will unveil more of September 6. And the combination of those two things and what I shared a moment ago around Prime customers gives us a lot of sort of excitement around what's possible to serve these Prime customers going forward, which is something that we've not benefited from a monetization perspective. None of that is included in our guidance, but it's something that we're very excited about. Yep. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for your question. I'll start with taking you back to five years ago when we declared our strategy was to really shift the company from just a tax and accounting platform, which is a very important set of problems to solve for customers to a global financial platform that really played a far more meaningful role in powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses on a daily basis. When we made that strategic declaration on the five bets that ensued, what we talked about at that time was that data and AI was going to be core to making that shift. And in fact, when we made the acquisition of both Credit Karma and Mailchimp, one huge driver of the acquisition was around the data, because in essence, we will know a lot more about customers, and we could leverage that data for their benefit to fuel their success. So -- and even five years ago declaring this, data and machine learning has been a decade-long focus of Intuit. So when you think about a decade-long investment in data usable data, cleaning the data and making sure that it's structured in a way where it can be used and then our investments in AI, specifically in knowledge engineering, which really takes rules and the relationship between data and turns it in the code is what our advantages in TurboTax, machine learning and natural language processing, those have been -- it's been a decade-long set of investments and the two acquisitions have propelled us forward about 10 years. And then you couple that with what we started several years ago, which is GenAI. And then what we launched in June, which is Generative Operating System, GenOS, which by the way, is not something you can create overnight. This is years of investment. When we couple those kind of investments, data, AI and GenOS, which is really primarily our own Intuit financial large language models that are trained on our customers' proprietary data, it allows us to personalize things, humanize things and do the work for customers in a way that's revolutionary, which ultimately gets to the punch line of we are creating a future that is done for you. Rather than you having to do the work to run your business, rather than you have to do the work to be able to power your prosperity, manage your finances as a consumer, we want to put you in control where it's done for you. You're always in control, you have the taste of whether or not you move forward with a decision. But we want to be able to help you grow your customers and run your business for you and help you manage your cash flow, always put the right choices in front of you. And the same thing goes on the tax side and Credit Karma side. So that's what's so exciting about -- it's a decade-long focus. We really tripled down on it five years ago when we declared our strategy. And we're -- we have now galvanized and energized the entire company that the [future of done for you] (ph) that we declared five years ago is very real, very much here. And we had an enormous opportunity to do amazing things for our customers. And that's what really gets us excited about what's possible. And so I can do another advertisement, join us September 6 for Intuit's Innovation Day, followed by Investor Day, and you'll get a real good feel for the world that we are going to create for the future. You're welcome. Scott, you cut out on us. We can now. Yes, if you don't mind start over again, we lost you. Sure. Let me start with your volume mix question around TurboTax. I would say the way to think about it was what I described earlier, leaning into full service, leaning into business tax and continue to lean into TurboTax Live, which really comes with assistance, recognizing it's all data and AI driven. You're going to see more come from ARPC than volume, and that's just the nature of the opportunity. Now there is 88 million-plus people that are in the assisted segment and there's $30 billion of spend. So there's both a volume opportunity and an ARPC opportunity. Just our view, looking at the next 10 years, by the way, this is not a one-year answer, both matter, you're going to get -- we're going to get more from ARPC. And I'll let Sandeep jump in here as well. I mean on the extension season, that's just been very weird with many states that got extended to July and California to October and what we're seeing from customers is they're even gotten confused which month they have to file in their state. So net-net is there's more to file. When you look at it at the company level, it's really not material, but not everybody has filed yet. All right, everybody. I think that brings our questions or Q&A to an end. So thank you for your wonderful questions. Thank you for spending the time with us. We look forward to seeing you September 6 and -- at our Investor Day. Take good care. Be safe. Bye, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Abby. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's third quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter revenue grew 7%, lower than our expectations, reflecting a unique tax season, while we exceeded operating income and earnings per share guidance. We continue to see strong growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which grew 21% in the quarter. Our overall performance this year demonstrates the strength of our platform and portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times while investing in the most important areas to drive long-term durable growth. We are raising our total company fiscal year 2023 revenue, operating income, earnings per share guidance. I am very proud of our team, as we now expect revenue and operating income to grow double digits, and margins to expand even more than previously guided. Let's turn to tax. While this was a unique tax season, we are making good progress transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. This year, we expect overall IRS returns to decline 2% through July 31, below our original expectations for total returns to grow 1%, which was more in-line with historical trends. We also expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to decline nearly 0.75 point, also below our expectation. We believe the IRS and DIY category declines are driven by those who filed in order to receive pandemic-era stimulus and tax credits during the past several years but did not file taxes this season. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth, and every point of DIY category share growth equals about 2.5 points of TurboTax revenue growth. The expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million of negative impact to revenue for TurboTax, versus our original expectations. We expect our share of total IRS returns to be down approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file taxes this season. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, although average annual trends over this period are far more in-line with longer-term trends. Over this four-year period, we expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, the DIY category share of total returns to be up 0.75 point, and our share of total returns to be up approximately 20 basis points, and average revenue per return to be up 9 points. These trends exclude users of the TurboTax Free file offering in prior-year periods. Our strategy to transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live is working, given the growth we have experienced in an environment where IRS returns are declining. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13% this year, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%, and total average revenue per return to grow 12%. While TurboTax Live has driven strong growth over the last six tax seasons, we still have an immense opportunity to penetrate and transform the assisted tax segment at an accelerated rate. This remains our top priority as we prepare for next year. Turning to small business, while we are not immune to the macro environment, our platform is resilient. Total online payment volume growth moderated 5 points from Q2, growing 20%. Despite this, the shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q3, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remained strong. Our small business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, remains critical to our customers' success. Let me now step back and talk about our company game plan to win. Four years ago, we declared our strategy to become the global AI-driven expert platform and five big bets as the primary areas of focus to drive durable growth. We invested heavily in our data and AI capabilities to deliver accelerated innovation. Today, we have over 100 million customers on our platform and use 400,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 55,000 tax and financial attributes per consumer to power 58 billion machine learning predictions per day. The acquisitions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp each contributed a rich and additive data set, which helped to deliver a 360 degree view of our customers. The scale of our data is an important competitive advantage and building block for our existing and future innovation with AI. We are accelerating re-imagining our customer experiences with generative AI capabilities, which we believe will be a driver of our long-term growth. Our platform capabilities are key to continued acceleration across all five of our Big Bets. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress across these Big Bets. As a reminder, our Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. This data and technology bet is foundational to everything we do. We began investing in generative AI two years ago to accelerate our ability to fuel the success of consumers and small businesses. We implemented generative AI in Mailchimp, powering the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. We deployed large language models, which recognize, summarize, and generate text, in our virtual expert platform to automatically summarize calls, reduce call times by hundreds of thousands of hours per year and reduce work for experts while improving efficiency. Our strategic investment in data and AI over the last four years positions us to lead through this technological shift, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. With our third Big Bet, our vision is for Credit Karma to become a comprehensive, self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are focused on growing Credit Karma Money, increasing member confidence to access financial products with Karma Guarantee, building out a richer experience for prime members, and becoming the financial platform of choice for consumers with the seamless integration of Credit Karma and TurboTax. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25%, despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. This season, we further streamlined the TurboTax filing experience into the Credit Karma app, and the number of customers using the experience to file their taxes was over five times higher than last year. With Credit Karma Money, we are innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress. This year, we saw over 45% growth in the number of TurboTax Online customers who received a refund advance in a Credit Karma Money account. This integration allowed approved members to get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepted their return, and drove increased debit card purchase activity, contributing to a more than 100% increase in Credit Karma Money revenue during the quarter. Members who use this offering show higher engagement on Credit Karma, which creates additional monetization opportunities over time. With the Mint team now part of Credit Karma, we are building a new experience for members with prime credit scores, where Credit Karma is underpenetrated today. During the quarter, we began rolling out Net Worth, which helps prime members better understand their wealth. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payroll, our U.S. QBO payroll customers grew double digits this quarter, and the mix of online customers choosing our high-end offerings increased by over 1 point, driving higher ARPC. And in payments, we continue to innovate to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and Get Paid Upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 20% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments, to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. Following our launch of the QuickBooks Business Network to millions of QBO customers in January, we are piloting our own native bill pay solution, and launched the initial beta of this functionality in QuickBooks earlier this month. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made great progress against these priorities. We're continuing to see better paid conversion, improving retention versus last quarter, and stronger paid customer growth. This, along with higher revenue per customer, drove a several point acceleration in revenue growth versus last quarter. Let me share some details around our progress: To help introduce new customers to Mailchimp and drive customer growth over time, we introduced free trials, similar to what we offer for QBO. In early testing, this is already driving higher paid conversion and a mix shift into our higher end offerings. To drive stronger retention of mid-market customers, we continue to leverage our virtual expert platform to offer assisted onboarding, with the goal of guiding these customers to more advanced features, and increasing awareness and usage. This quarter, we saw more than 7 point increase in high value customers going through this onboarding process versus last quarter, which we expect to help drive stronger retention over time. To drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages. Early results indicate this translation work is driving increased activations, and ultimately can drive revenue growth. And our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market, representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. Online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we are driving ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy, we are innovating at high velocity, using the power of our platform, modern technology capabilities, data sets, and artificial intelligence to deliver new offerings at scale. This is helping us put more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time, and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. We are well positioned to power prosperity for the people and communities that we serve, as we enter this next technological shift. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $6 billion; GAAP operating income of $2.8 billion versus $2.4 billion last year; non-GAAP operating income of $3.4 billion versus $2.9 billion last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.38 versus $6.28 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.92 versus $7.65 last year. Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue of $3.3 billion grew 3% in Q3. There are four primary drivers of our Consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2023 versus the prior year through July 31, 2022. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We expect total returns to decline 2% this year. This is below our original expectations of up 1%, as overall industry growth continues to reflect the multi-year impact from the pandemic. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category of total IRS returns to be down nearly 0.75 point by the end of the fiscal year, below our original expectations. The third is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to decline by approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file this season. As a result of these same industry dynamics, we expect our retention to decline this year. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase 12% this year, as we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13%, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%. Historically, each point of total IRS returns growth corresponds to approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the Consumer Group and each point of DIY category share growth corresponds to approximately 2.5 points of revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Using these historical sensitivities, the expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million negative impact to revenue for the Consumer Group versus our original expectations. As a result of this expected decline in IRS returns, we anticipate total customers to decline 5% this year. We expect TurboTax Online paying customers to decline 1% this year, and a total of over 11 million customers who pay us nothing, down from 13 million last year. We now expect full year Consumer Group revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus our prior guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the expected declines in IRS returns and DIY category share I mentioned earlier. Looking back over the last four years, including our updated guidance for this fiscal year, we expect our revenue to have grown over 10% on average annually, in-line with our long-term expectations. We continue to anticipate Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long-term. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue declined 5% in Q3. For the full year, we now expect ProTax revenue growth of 2% to 3%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter, and online ecosystem revenue grew 23%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 25% in Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q3. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter accelerated several points from low-teens growth last quarter. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and customer growth. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix-shift to higher end offerings. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 16% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew approximately 20%. We are just over half-way through a three-year transition to a subscription model for our desktop accounting solutions, making this revenue more predictable. We also raised our desktop prices for several products last September to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next quarter and as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. We will continue to build out our online ecosystem, and help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings when they're ready. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term. As a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 24% from 19% to 20%. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $410 million in Q3, down 12%. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto loans and auto insurance, partially offset by growth in Credit Karma Money and credit cards. We are seeing more stability across our core verticals. In both credit cards and personal loans, we continued to see some partners tighten eligibility, while some expanded eligibility during the quarter. In personal loans, we continue to see partners facing funding constraints. We added more partners to the platform to help diversify our partner base. However, we continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a decline of 11% from a decline of 15% to 10%. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $483 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, payable July 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I've shared consistently in the past, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term, and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward looking and adjust quickly. I am proud of the team for how effectively we have used our playbook to invest in the most important growth drivers to position Intuit for the future while maintaining earnings power this year, despite the macro impact we are experiencing. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes: total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, up from prior guidance of 10% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 19% to 20%, up from prior guidance of 9% to 13% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 21%, up from prior guidance of 17% to 19% growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 7% to 8%, up from prior guidance of a decline of approximately 5% to 1%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 20%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 includes: revenue growth of 9% to 10%; GAAP loss per share of $0.34 to $0.29; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.43 to $1.48. We expect a significant increase in our cash tax payments related to fiscal 2023 as a result of the tax law changes that require capitalization of certain R&D costs. With the recent IRS disaster-area tax relief, we expect to pay approximately $700 million, related to fiscal 2023, in Q1 of fiscal 2024. You can find our full fiscal 2023 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Excellent. Thank you, Michelle. I know you'll be with us for another couple of months, but since this is your last earnings call, I want to express my sincere appreciation for all that you have contributed to Intuit over the last 20 years. You have made me, my leadership team, and the entire company better, and I am forever grateful. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our five Big Bets, and in an uncertain macro [Technical Difficulty] mission-critical than ever to our customers. Let's now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And Michelle, congrats on a phenomenal run. We will miss you next quarter for sure on the earnings call. I've got one for Sasan and maybe let me sneak one in for Michelle, especially since it is her last call. Sasan, how should we think about your big bet in helping customers overcome their lack of confidence by connecting them to Live experts in a world where generative AI is advancing at breakneck speed? Because I think you spoke about how you're using generative AI to deliver the Live platform. But how is Intuit positioned in a world where LLMs may be able to deliver human-like guidance interaction? And maybe for you, Michelle, your Consumer segment operating margin was consistent with last year despite the pressure on the top-line for all the reasons that you've mentioned. Just curious how much visibility that you might have had into how tax would play out and if you scale back investment at all perhaps even marketing dollars into the end of the season? Thanks so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Brad, thank you so much for your question. And I heard that I fell off when I was reading the last part of the scripts. So, if I have bad connection, I will switch phones and hop back to make sure I answer your question. But let me start with the question that you asked. First of all, I would take us back to what we declared four years ago. As you know, I've been on the record four-plus years ago to say that I believe, and we believe as a company, that artificial intelligence is going to ignite global growth. And I believe that it's the biggest thing next to what we've experienced over time with electricity and the Internet. It's that big and it's that critical of a platform of innovation, which is why data and AI have been core to our investments in the last four-plus years. And with that as context, it's why we've been investing, specifically, in machine learning, knowledge engineering, natural language processing, and several years ago, we really started accelerating our investments in generative AI. And if I take it back to your question around confidence, when we've talked about solving the biggest unsaid problem that customers have, which is around confidence, it is really about solving it by helping them feel confident in their decision. And it doesn't necessarily always mean people. And in fact, if you look at our interactions today across all of our platforms, a large number of our interactions is actually our machines that are solving the customers' large problems. The reason we are so excited about AI from four-plus years ago is that you couple our data, which is a 360 view of the customer, it's actually where Credit Karma and Mailchimp has played such an important role to add to our rich data sets, you couple that with the investments in AI and now with generative AI, we can actually accelerate penetrating non consumption. And this is across every customer that we serve, whether it's consumers, across Credit Karma, whether it's tax, whether it's small business, we have an incredible opportunity to accelerate, making things more easier, more digestible and more confident inspiring for our customers. And in fact, it's generative AI that gives us the ability to do things that we could never imagine possible because of the data that we have. So for us, we saw this as an accelerant several years ago. It's why we accelerated our investments and it's why we're so excited about the future, because the large language models, coupled with AI, coupled with machine learning and the investments that we've made, we believe that we can actually accelerate our innovation as we look ahead. And hopefully, I was loud and clear.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes, that was good. And Brad, first of all, thank you for the kind words. Your question around our ability to maintain earnings power within CG, really it's a focus for us as the whole company and it started last year when we were going through our three- and one-year planning process. We assumed that there would be economic uncertainty this year. And so, as we were going through the process, we made sure that we had funded those things that were most important to delivering for customers and being able to drive our revenue growth. And then, we were made list of the levers that we had that we could pull as we went throughout the year to be able to maintain our earnings power. And those are some of the discretionary things we had, which were whether it's travel or advertising or moderating hiring. And so, our lower tax units also this year did result in lower expenses for that segment, specifically in customer success. But really, it's about us looking at maintaining not CG margins, but really at the company level and it started last year in planning.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. And goodbye to you, Michelle. We'll miss you. Question for Sasan and the team. Sasan, in order to get back to the targets of 8% to 12% longer-term in Consumer, you're going to have to reaccelerate the tax business. So, if we can go back to the basics from the old days, how does it -- do you plan to grow the category? And how do you gain share of that category? That would be great. And also, as it pretends to generative AI, does this open up more opportunities netted against maybe potentially new competitive entrants? Because there is a bare thesis, which I'm sure you will have a different view on that, that it actually makes it easier to file for taxes. Brad was talking about that -- Brad Zelnick, earlier. So, does it expand the opportunity set, at the same time attracting new competition? Or how do we think about how it nets out for you guys? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for the question, Kash. So, a couple of things I would start with. I'll take your question around reaccelerating revenue growth. First of all, if I step back and look at the $200 million of impact that we experienced this year because of the lower number of returns and based on all the analysis that we've done, it's really the pandemic era filers that came in to get access to their stimulus into their tax credits. And those have, based on our own analysis, have really all now left in the category. One, we believe we'll get to sort of a more normal environment. That is really what drove the performance -- the lower performance than we expected this year. The second thing to get to your question around reacceleration, this is where I feel very good about the performance in an environment where there were lower returns with our TurboTax Live business. If you think about it, this is now $1 billion-plus business growing 19%. And I believe in the next several years, this will actually be the largest part of the TurboTax business. And it's really in context of getting after the $30 billion of TAM that is consumers that go to an assisted offering to get their taxes done or businesses that get their business tax done. And we believe based on what we learned this year with our full service offering that we have an enormous chance to be able to really penetrate at a much more accelerated rate as we look ahead. And therefore, very confident in not only our performance this year if you exclude the lower number of returns, but also the green shoots that we saw going into next year, inclusive of the fact that we had 5x of growth in the Credit Karma platform. And we learned a number of things that we're going to double down on going into next year. And let me couple that with your second question around AI, listen, I would say we were the ones four-plus years ago that said, and we're on the record, that we believe that AI will absolutely be disruptive. And it's why we made investments in data. Because AI, particularly generative AI, is really meaningless without data. And so, with the investments that we've made in having a 360 view of data for consumers and small businesses, we actually, Kash, see it as an incredible accelerant. And I'll just remind us of, we often talk about we have $300 billion TAM with 5% penetration. And most of our customers use Excel, Google Sheet, [indiscernible], whether it's a small business or a consumer, to manage their life, to manage their business or they go have a bookkeeper help them run their business. And the reason is it's 5%, because it's all comes down to confidence. So, we actually see our investments in the last four-plus years in data and AI with what we are now investing in with generative AI, we, for us, think it's an acceleration because we have incredible scale. We have data scale, AI scale, customer scale, and we have sort of rich data sets that is really undisputed, which means we can do things for customers that is hard for anybody else to do. So, we actually see it as an accelerant and we're excited about the possibilities, given the proof points that we've seen and given the investments that we are currently making. So that's the way we think about it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Congrats, Sasan, thanks for taking the question. And Michelle, good luck on your next endeavor. I guess, Sasan, can you just talk about the state of the small business? There's a lot of debate on that right now. Obviously, you all had a nice quarter in SBSE. Could you just talk about what you're seeing there in terms of the different verticals you play in and frankly the ability for you all to upsell some of your offerings like payroll payments? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Let me, Kirk, frame my answer in two dimensions. One, what we see across all small businesses on our platform and off of our platform. There's a couple of things that we see. One is, there is an impact to small businesses' revenue. They're still growing. It depends on the sector. But in aggregate, what we see is that they are still growing. But they also, depending on the sectors they serve, they have profit pressures. So if they're in real estate or if they're in lending, they certainly have more profit pressure than those that don't serve those sectors. We also see that customers -- we would -- we put them in the bucket of the older, more tenured customers, 70% of those customers actually have more cash reserves than they did pre-pandemic. It's more of the younger newer businesses that have started since the pandemic that generally they have less cash reserves than they [Technical Difficulty] sort of the state of the small businesses. They feel the impact and the pressure of the environment from consumer spending standpoint. But net-net, when you look in aggregate, they are still growing with some of the data points that I mentioned a moment ago. With that said, when we look at our platform, it's why we're just being -- continuing to be intentional about sharing the proof points that we shared today, our platform is not immune, but we are resilient. And so, when you look at some of the data points that we shared, our payments -- our total payments -- online payments volume is 20%, which is actually quite healthy, but it's down 5 points. At the same time, when we look at our overall performance across Mailchimp and QuickBooks, we actually are seeing strength in serving our mid-market customers and continuing to serve our customers that have been on the platform for a long time. The proof points that I shared was our customer growth in mid-market is strong, we're growing payroll -- U.S. payroll double digit, and we're actually seeing a migration to our higher-end payroll offerings. So, net-net, we are not immune, but we are resilient and we feel really good about the sustained growth that we've delivered and the trajectory of the KPIs that we see as we look into next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys. And Michelle, it's been great working for you -- with you over the years. So, congratulations on all the great work that you've done. Sasan, a question for you on just tax and kind of how unfolded throughout the season -- this season. I understand sort of overall filings down because of less people kind of getting the refunds, right? And I understand DIY is probably a bigger component of it. I don't quite understand why TurboTax loses a share in that dynamic. Like, what's the mechanism by which you guys get hit harder than others and therefore kind of lose share? That's question number one. And question number two, there has been some concern about an extended tax season and the ability for approximately 10% of filers to be able to file at a later date that pushes out of your fiscal year. You didn't mention that. Was there any significant impact from that side of the equation that some of this tax strength might just push into next fiscal year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure, Keith, great question. Let me start with your share question. First and foremost, the majority of -- in fact, we would say close to all of those that came into the category of taxes to get access to their stimulus dollars and to their tax credits that were not tax filers before, almost all of them came into the do-it-yourself category because it was so much easier and faster to get access to, in essence, all their credit. And those are the filers that we see that have left the do-it-yourself category. The reason our share is down as actually pure math. We're the largest share player in the do-it-yourself category and we got the largest share of those folks that actually came in during the pandemic era. And when they left the category just by pure math and the cohort of customers numbers that we review in our retention, what we, in essence, see is those cohort of customers that came in that did not file taxes before to get access to credits are the ones that left, which is actually what gives us confidence when we look at our key retention cohorts looking ahead, but also our TurboTax Live performance that we talked about earlier. So that's where -- that's how the share plays out. It's pure math. We got the majority of them and when they left the category, they left TurboTax. In terms of extensions, yes, there's dollars attached to it, Keith. But in context of $14 billion company, it's really -- we don't consider it material. So that's why we didn't show and I didn't really spend much time talking about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. And Michelle, it was great working with you. Good luck with your next endeavor. And Sasan, I want to dig into Mailchimp. It's good to see that acceleration to mid- to high-teens growth in Mailchimp. So, could you talk about like you made some changes, how much of that contributed to growth versus what are you seeing in the demand environment? Is macro really a headwind at this point? What are you seeing in the spending pattern on marketing from your customer base? And how [sustainable] (ph) going forward?\nSasan Goodarzi: Was the last part of your question how sustained is that going forward?\nSiti Panigrahi: Yes.\nSasan Goodarzi: Okay. So thank you for the question. First of all, very consistent with what I've shared in the last probably 18 months or so, we felt and I felt very strongly that the opportunity that we had with Mailchimp is how we bring it together with QuickBooks to truly create one platform that becomes the source of truth for running your business. And in an environment where now we have access to, with our customers' permission, the data applying AI and generative AI, we can now shift the platform to a place where we can do everything for you and deliver insights to help you manage your cash flow, to help you grow your customers, and that's really the ultimate game changer that we are focused on. With that said, the thing that I've been very consistent with you all is that this is all about execution. So, all of the progress that you're seeing us talk about in Mailchimp is all better execution. It is not any macro tailwinds. This is from the talent that we've put in place at the leadership level and the talent that we have upgraded across Mailchimp to then end-to-end. We've been revamping the website. We have looking at business model innovation and our line-up that we've made improvements. We're improving the product. We're doubling down on mid-market. And not only getting our existing customers to understand what features and functionality that we have to deliver the benefit, which helps us with retention and expansion revenue, but also the new customers that we're getting, assisted onboarding and using a lot of our AI and virtual expert platform capability. So, those were sort of illustrative examples relative to why we're seeing paid conversion increase, paid customers increase or seeing better retention and better revenue per customer, it is all execution. And I expect this to continue to improve our execution, and coupling that with what we're doing across the QuickBooks platform, truly creating one platform that becomes a source of truth for your business. I am excited and bullish about the future possibilities of what we can do for small businesses, particularly with what's possible with data and gen AI.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. And Michelle, best wishes for sure. Sasan, I guess this is going to be a double tax question. The IRS is down 1% year-to-date, you're saying down 2% through the end of July. Just curious just what's going to take it down more in your eyes and how that looks in future years as you -- if you continue to think this is more just a pandemic-related [flow year] (ph) and we get back to normalcy? That's part number one. And part number two, historically, when we look at unit growth of TurboTax, which was -- you anticipate to be negative 5% and then revenue per return, which you anticipate to be plus 12%, usually A plus B equals the Consumer segment revenue growth, but you have -- and that would be 7-plus, but you're guiding 5% to 6%. So, is there conservatism in there? Or is there maybe some financial products that you were unable to sell, so you're getting a little less -- maybe it's not qualified as revenue per return but something else or maybe it's something that's not TurboTax related directly in the category? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Scott. Let me take your first question. There are two assumptions that we are making based on all the data that we have and what we see from last year. One is, there was actually a lot more extensions last year than we view will take place this year even with the states that have pushed out. Plus last year, there were more filers. This is in the bucket of the pre-pandemic era or the pandemic era filers that came in to get their stimulus money in their tax credits. There was still a lot of those filers last year through July and little bit beyond. And so when we take out those filers, and we compare to the extensions last year, our view is that IRS will be down 2%, and so that has, of course, an impact, 2%, which has an impact on the performance that we talked about. Secondarily, we really did an incredible amount of analysis to make sure that we had an understanding of these pandemic era filers and are they all sort of out. And the reality is there's no more stimulus or tax credits to be had by those filers. So based on all of our analysis, they are out. And so therefore, we expect this year that IRS at a minimum is going to be flat. And of course, when we guide, we'll share with you what we've assumed in our guidance in August. But we would assume, at a minimum, it will be flat, maybe even up, but at a minimum, flat based on the reasons that I just mentioned. So that's the first part of your question. The second part of your question is a really good one, and I'll get to the specifics in a moment. I think just sort of reiterate even in an environment where IRS returns went down, our future is TurboTax Live. And our future is the growth of what we can do with our Live platform, especially with the data and AI capabilities. We have to really disrupt the assisted segment. And our real [accompass] (ph) going forward is going to be the growth of our TurboTax Live platform both in terms of customer growth and revenue growth. And I may just ask Michelle to weigh in on this, but this sort of comes down to just pure math in terms of when we look at our units and we look at what folks paid for and sort of adds up to the 12 point speed up in ARPC. It's really nothing beyond that. But let me just ask Michelle. Michelle, would you weigh in on that point at all beyond what I just shared?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Sorry. I'm having trouble with the mute button there. No, Sasan, some of it can just be also rounding with units and returns. And so, I wouldn't get overly concerned on that, Scott.\nSasan Goodarzi: Got it. So the headline is, the 12 point in ARPC growth is sort of very tangible relative to the units that we got.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes. You got the 12 points of ARPC. And then as you said Scott, we shared, we expect the units to be down 5%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple more on tax. I think you mentioned before that overall retention, because of the factors you mentioned on the call already, is going to be down this year. But could you focus in on just Live retention given how important that's going to be for the future of the platform? How did that shake out this year? And if you could share in terms of Live customer growth, are you getting more from takeaways from competitors? Or is these DIY customers trading up to Live? Any color you can provide there would be helpful. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Daniel. First of all, yes, you're right in what you heard us say earlier, which is we would expect retention to be down 1 point-plus. And we'll talk about it, of course, more at Investor Day. And it's really because of these pandemic-era filers that came in and have now left the categories. Overall, we like the mix of what we've seen across our Live platform, and we'll share again more of the specifics as we get into Investor Day. But our retention and sort of existing customers coming back, we felt very good about what we expected and what we saw. I would say the second thing is it's a mix. It's a mix of both those that did taxes themselves the prior year that ultimately chose to upgrade to a sort of a Live platform because something changed in their life, inclusive of getting customers that were prior year assisted. And remember, our -- really, our competition is those that go to mom-and-pop shop. It's the 88 million folks where the majority of them will ultimately go to a local mom-and-pop shop to get their taxes done, and that's where we get a lot of the switches also from those mom-and-pop shops. So, we have a good mix of retention. Those that did taxes themselves last year and chose to use the Live platform because of a confidence question or some concern and then getting those that were prior assisted. And that's a mix we like, and that's a mix we believe will continue. Now it will be different as we take full service to either further scale, because we believe we'll accelerate full service penetration at a much higher rate than even today. So that's the way I would have you think about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. One question on Credit Karma. You kind of raised the guidance there, and that came after a quarter where we had a lot of turmoil in the financial services industry with the regional banks, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter in terms of the extra headwinds that obviously played out there, but you're actually doing better than what you had guided previously? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: We're actually continuing to see strength based on our innovation in a couple of areas. One is in cards and in some parts driven by our Karma Guarantee, which is really unique to Credit Karma, where the certainty is very high for a member to get approved for what they are looking for because of the data and AI capabilities that we have. The second is Credit Karma Money. And this is where, as I always have shared, we are building a consumer platform to be the destination for consumers with the integrations that we're doing with TurboTax and Credit Karma. And in essence, we saw a 45% increase in the number of TurboTax customers that chose to put their money on a Credit Karma Money account. And not only do we make some revenue on that, but over time, based on the higher frequency of the engagement, we can ultimately monetize even further, which were not in the numbers that I just mentioned. So really, it's across our innovation across cards and Credit Karma Money. That's why we saw the performance that we saw in the quarter. And then with one quarter left in the year, we, of course, have confidence to improve the guidance that we provided to what Michelle shared earlier.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking our questions guys. We saw the press release related to the IRS direct filing program, but I just thought maybe, Sasan, if we could hear what you're thinking are maybe the largest potential threat of that study that came out as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I'll share a couple of perspectives that is really consistent with what we've talked about, but this is probably an important time to reiterate how we think about it. First and foremost, I can't vouch for their study. I can simply vouch for the facts that we have and the facts that are already in the market. And I think the first one is free tax software is already available to all consumers, and the awareness is actually quite high. That's the first thing that I would just remind us of. I think the second thing I would say is a reminder of this will yet be another free tax software in the marketplace. And I would just say, if you look at the last four-plus years, there were several entrants, big entrants, into the free tax software. One was Credit Karma before we acquired them, where they have 100 million-plus customers, a trusted platform. And they entered into the market of providing free tax software with sort of very little to no impact. And then another very large player that we sold Credit Karma tax to when we acquired Credit Karma. And you can, of course, observe what their results are. The point is that free tax software is already available, has been available to every consumer, and the awareness is extremely high. And so to have another sort of free tax software that's available is really immaterial is the way we think about it. And I'll remind us, by the way, it's actually not free. This is going to cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and so it's really not free. And I think the last thing I would say is really back to our vision. Our vision has been from what we declared four years ago to really become a consumer platform of choice, which means that beyond serving you to help you get your taxes done, we're delivering benefits through Credit Karma beyond tax, which means we can monetize beyond tax. And really out of the $35 billion TAM in tax, less than $5 billion to do-it-yourself. And really, our biggest opportunity is the other $30 billion we're going after, $20 billion of it being consumers that have somebody else get their taxes done and $10 billion being business tax. That's our future. That's our presence. That's where we are focused. And so net-net, when I think about the IRS study that was announced, I think it's a study. Facts are friendly, you look at the facts in the marketplace, this is for us, this is really not a threat at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the TurboTax ARPU number. Such a nice increase that you're expecting this year, 12%. Could you help unpack that a little bit for us, please? Obviously, TurboTax Live was a key driver there. I guess two questions. Were there other contributors here, premium mix shift or other items perhaps? And then also on TT Live, what would you attribute the strength to? We've seen the ads this tax season; \"Don't do your taxes, we'll do them for you.\" Is it just growing awareness of QuickBook -- sorry, of TurboTax as a solution to help with assisted? You've been at this for a number of years. So just kind of, I guess, what's working there? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Brad. A couple of things. You actually nailed that our ARPU increase on top of ARPU increases in the last several years has come from TurboTax Live. It is a disruptive price offering. At the same time, it's got much higher ARPU and some of the more premium customers that chose -- they're either self-employed or they're investors and, of course, chose our premium SKU, which has a higher ARPU. So those are a couple of big drivers. I would tell you that the thing that I am sort of most excited about where the insights and the learnings that we got this year that really informs what we're going to double down on right now as we prepare for next year. One is full service. Full service is not an offering that is -- has product market fit. It's at scale. It -- we got an 84 Net Promoter Score this year, which is the highest Net Promoter of anything across the company we have ever had. And you've heard me say it before around Credit Karma, well, this is even a higher Net Promoter. And that contributed to a small amount this year because we were really being thoughtful and careful about ensuring we get to -- we have the right product market fit and we can deliver for customers. Well, we surprised ourselves in terms of the product market fit, and we're going to be really intentional about doubling down on that next year. I think I would say the other thing, back to your question around learning, is we really learned where and how experts. And remember, experts is not just human. It's both our AI and generative AI capabilities and/or humans depending on the need of the customer engaging around the money experience, helping customers understand their refund, changes in their refund or their balance due and changes in their balance due. We learned, coupled with our go-to-market strategy, how to really nail that benefit, and that's what drove the growth. But we believe we are capable of so much more growth as we look ahead based on the insights we got towards the end of the season, and that's what we'll be focused on as we head into next year.\nOperator: That's all the time we have today for questions. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Just to say thank you for all your great questions, and many thanks to our employees and customers for their amazing focus and being part of this storied franchise, and we look forward to seeing all of you at next earnings. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $6 billion; GAAP operating income of $2.8 billion versus $2.4 billion last year; non-GAAP operating income of $3.4 billion versus $2.9 billion last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.38 versus $6.28 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.92 versus $7.65 last year. Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue of $3.3 billion grew 3% in Q3. There are four primary drivers of our Consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2023 versus the prior year through July 31, 2022. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We expect total returns to decline 2% this year. This is below our original expectations of up 1%, as overall industry growth continues to reflect the multi-year impact from the pandemic. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category of total IRS returns to be down nearly 0.75 point by the end of the fiscal year, below our original expectations. The third is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to decline by approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file this season. As a result of these same industry dynamics, we expect our retention to decline this year. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase 12% this year, as we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13%, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%. Historically, each point of total IRS returns growth corresponds to approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the Consumer Group and each point of DIY category share growth corresponds to approximately 2.5 points of revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Using these historical sensitivities, the expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million negative impact to revenue for the Consumer Group versus our original expectations. As a result of this expected decline in IRS returns, we anticipate total customers to decline 5% this year. We expect TurboTax Online paying customers to decline 1% this year, and a total of over 11 million customers who pay us nothing, down from 13 million last year. We now expect full year Consumer Group revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus our prior guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the expected declines in IRS returns and DIY category share I mentioned earlier. Looking back over the last four years, including our updated guidance for this fiscal year, we expect our revenue to have grown over 10% on average annually, in-line with our long-term expectations. We continue to anticipate Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long-term. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue declined 5% in Q3. For the full year, we now expect ProTax revenue growth of 2% to 3%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter, and online ecosystem revenue grew 23%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 25% in Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q3. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter accelerated several points from low-teens growth last quarter. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and customer growth. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix-shift to higher end offerings. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 16% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew approximately 20%. We are just over half-way through a three-year transition to a subscription model for our desktop accounting solutions, making this revenue more predictable. We also raised our desktop prices for several products last September to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next quarter and as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. We will continue to build out our online ecosystem, and help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings when they're ready. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term. As a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 24% from 19% to 20%. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $410 million in Q3, down 12%. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto loans and auto insurance, partially offset by growth in Credit Karma Money and credit cards. We are seeing more stability across our core verticals. In both credit cards and personal loans, we continued to see some partners tighten eligibility, while some expanded eligibility during the quarter. In personal loans, we continue to see partners facing funding constraints. We added more partners to the platform to help diversify our partner base. However, we continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a decline of 11% from a decline of 15% to 10%. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $483 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, payable July 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I've shared consistently in the past, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term, and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward looking and adjust quickly. I am proud of the team for how effectively we have used our playbook to invest in the most important growth drivers to position Intuit for the future while maintaining earnings power this year, despite the macro impact we are experiencing. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes: total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, up from prior guidance of 10% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 19% to 20%, up from prior guidance of 9% to 13% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 21%, up from prior guidance of 17% to 19% growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 7% to 8%, up from prior guidance of a decline of approximately 5% to 1%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 20%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 includes: revenue growth of 9% to 10%; GAAP loss per share of $0.34 to $0.29; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.43 to $1.48. We expect a significant increase in our cash tax payments related to fiscal 2023 as a result of the tax law changes that require capitalization of certain R&D costs. With the recent IRS disaster-area tax relief, we expect to pay approximately $700 million, related to fiscal 2023, in Q1 of fiscal 2024. You can find our full fiscal 2023 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Yes, that was good. And Brad, first of all, thank you for the kind words. Your question around our ability to maintain earnings power within CG, really it's a focus for us as the whole company and it started last year when we were going through our three- and one-year planning process. We assumed that there would be economic uncertainty this year. And so, as we were going through the process, we made sure that we had funded those things that were most important to delivering for customers and being able to drive our revenue growth. And then, we were made list of the levers that we had that we could pull as we went throughout the year to be able to maintain our earnings power. And those are some of the discretionary things we had, which were whether it's travel or advertising or moderating hiring. And so, our lower tax units also this year did result in lower expenses for that segment, specifically in customer success. But really, it's about us looking at maintaining not CG margins, but really at the company level and it started last year in planning. Sorry. I'm having trouble with the mute button there. No, Sasan, some of it can just be also rounding with units and returns. And so, I wouldn't get overly concerned on that, Scott. Yes. You got the 12 points of ARPC. And then as you said Scott, we shared, we expect the units to be down 5%."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter revenue grew 7%, lower than our expectations, reflecting a unique tax season, while we exceeded operating income and earnings per share guidance. We continue to see strong growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which grew 21% in the quarter. Our overall performance this year demonstrates the strength of our platform and portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times while investing in the most important areas to drive long-term durable growth. We are raising our total company fiscal year 2023 revenue, operating income, earnings per share guidance. I am very proud of our team, as we now expect revenue and operating income to grow double digits, and margins to expand even more than previously guided. Let's turn to tax. While this was a unique tax season, we are making good progress transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. This year, we expect overall IRS returns to decline 2% through July 31, below our original expectations for total returns to grow 1%, which was more in-line with historical trends. We also expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to decline nearly 0.75 point, also below our expectation. We believe the IRS and DIY category declines are driven by those who filed in order to receive pandemic-era stimulus and tax credits during the past several years but did not file taxes this season. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth, and every point of DIY category share growth equals about 2.5 points of TurboTax revenue growth. The expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million of negative impact to revenue for TurboTax, versus our original expectations. We expect our share of total IRS returns to be down approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file taxes this season. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, although average annual trends over this period are far more in-line with longer-term trends. Over this four-year period, we expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, the DIY category share of total returns to be up 0.75 point, and our share of total returns to be up approximately 20 basis points, and average revenue per return to be up 9 points. These trends exclude users of the TurboTax Free file offering in prior-year periods. Our strategy to transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live is working, given the growth we have experienced in an environment where IRS returns are declining. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13% this year, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%, and total average revenue per return to grow 12%. While TurboTax Live has driven strong growth over the last six tax seasons, we still have an immense opportunity to penetrate and transform the assisted tax segment at an accelerated rate. This remains our top priority as we prepare for next year. Turning to small business, while we are not immune to the macro environment, our platform is resilient. Total online payment volume growth moderated 5 points from Q2, growing 20%. Despite this, the shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q3, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remained strong. Our small business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, remains critical to our customers' success. Let me now step back and talk about our company game plan to win. Four years ago, we declared our strategy to become the global AI-driven expert platform and five big bets as the primary areas of focus to drive durable growth. We invested heavily in our data and AI capabilities to deliver accelerated innovation. Today, we have over 100 million customers on our platform and use 400,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 55,000 tax and financial attributes per consumer to power 58 billion machine learning predictions per day. The acquisitions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp each contributed a rich and additive data set, which helped to deliver a 360 degree view of our customers. The scale of our data is an important competitive advantage and building block for our existing and future innovation with AI. We are accelerating re-imagining our customer experiences with generative AI capabilities, which we believe will be a driver of our long-term growth. Our platform capabilities are key to continued acceleration across all five of our Big Bets. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress across these Big Bets. As a reminder, our Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. This data and technology bet is foundational to everything we do. We began investing in generative AI two years ago to accelerate our ability to fuel the success of consumers and small businesses. We implemented generative AI in Mailchimp, powering the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. We deployed large language models, which recognize, summarize, and generate text, in our virtual expert platform to automatically summarize calls, reduce call times by hundreds of thousands of hours per year and reduce work for experts while improving efficiency. Our strategic investment in data and AI over the last four years positions us to lead through this technological shift, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. With our third Big Bet, our vision is for Credit Karma to become a comprehensive, self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are focused on growing Credit Karma Money, increasing member confidence to access financial products with Karma Guarantee, building out a richer experience for prime members, and becoming the financial platform of choice for consumers with the seamless integration of Credit Karma and TurboTax. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25%, despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. This season, we further streamlined the TurboTax filing experience into the Credit Karma app, and the number of customers using the experience to file their taxes was over five times higher than last year. With Credit Karma Money, we are innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress. This year, we saw over 45% growth in the number of TurboTax Online customers who received a refund advance in a Credit Karma Money account. This integration allowed approved members to get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepted their return, and drove increased debit card purchase activity, contributing to a more than 100% increase in Credit Karma Money revenue during the quarter. Members who use this offering show higher engagement on Credit Karma, which creates additional monetization opportunities over time. With the Mint team now part of Credit Karma, we are building a new experience for members with prime credit scores, where Credit Karma is underpenetrated today. During the quarter, we began rolling out Net Worth, which helps prime members better understand their wealth. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payroll, our U.S. QBO payroll customers grew double digits this quarter, and the mix of online customers choosing our high-end offerings increased by over 1 point, driving higher ARPC. And in payments, we continue to innovate to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and Get Paid Upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 20% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments, to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. Following our launch of the QuickBooks Business Network to millions of QBO customers in January, we are piloting our own native bill pay solution, and launched the initial beta of this functionality in QuickBooks earlier this month. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made great progress against these priorities. We're continuing to see better paid conversion, improving retention versus last quarter, and stronger paid customer growth. This, along with higher revenue per customer, drove a several point acceleration in revenue growth versus last quarter. Let me share some details around our progress: To help introduce new customers to Mailchimp and drive customer growth over time, we introduced free trials, similar to what we offer for QBO. In early testing, this is already driving higher paid conversion and a mix shift into our higher end offerings. To drive stronger retention of mid-market customers, we continue to leverage our virtual expert platform to offer assisted onboarding, with the goal of guiding these customers to more advanced features, and increasing awareness and usage. This quarter, we saw more than 7 point increase in high value customers going through this onboarding process versus last quarter, which we expect to help drive stronger retention over time. To drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages. Early results indicate this translation work is driving increased activations, and ultimately can drive revenue growth. And our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market, representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. Online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we are driving ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy, we are innovating at high velocity, using the power of our platform, modern technology capabilities, data sets, and artificial intelligence to deliver new offerings at scale. This is helping us put more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time, and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. We are well positioned to power prosperity for the people and communities that we serve, as we enter this next technological shift. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Excellent. Thank you, Michelle. I know you'll be with us for another couple of months, but since this is your last earnings call, I want to express my sincere appreciation for all that you have contributed to Intuit over the last 20 years. You have made me, my leadership team, and the entire company better, and I am forever grateful. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our five Big Bets, and in an uncertain macro [Technical Difficulty] mission-critical than ever to our customers. Let's now open it up to your questions. Great. Brad, thank you so much for your question. And I heard that I fell off when I was reading the last part of the scripts. So, if I have bad connection, I will switch phones and hop back to make sure I answer your question. But let me start with the question that you asked. First of all, I would take us back to what we declared four years ago. As you know, I've been on the record four-plus years ago to say that I believe, and we believe as a company, that artificial intelligence is going to ignite global growth. And I believe that it's the biggest thing next to what we've experienced over time with electricity and the Internet. It's that big and it's that critical of a platform of innovation, which is why data and AI have been core to our investments in the last four-plus years. And with that as context, it's why we've been investing, specifically, in machine learning, knowledge engineering, natural language processing, and several years ago, we really started accelerating our investments in generative AI. And if I take it back to your question around confidence, when we've talked about solving the biggest unsaid problem that customers have, which is around confidence, it is really about solving it by helping them feel confident in their decision. And it doesn't necessarily always mean people. And in fact, if you look at our interactions today across all of our platforms, a large number of our interactions is actually our machines that are solving the customers' large problems. The reason we are so excited about AI from four-plus years ago is that you couple our data, which is a 360 view of the customer, it's actually where Credit Karma and Mailchimp has played such an important role to add to our rich data sets, you couple that with the investments in AI and now with generative AI, we can actually accelerate penetrating non consumption. And this is across every customer that we serve, whether it's consumers, across Credit Karma, whether it's tax, whether it's small business, we have an incredible opportunity to accelerate, making things more easier, more digestible and more confident inspiring for our customers. And in fact, it's generative AI that gives us the ability to do things that we could never imagine possible because of the data that we have. So for us, we saw this as an accelerant several years ago. It's why we accelerated our investments and it's why we're so excited about the future, because the large language models, coupled with AI, coupled with machine learning and the investments that we've made, we believe that we can actually accelerate our innovation as we look ahead. And hopefully, I was loud and clear. Yes. Thank you for the question, Kash. So, a couple of things I would start with. I'll take your question around reaccelerating revenue growth. First of all, if I step back and look at the $200 million of impact that we experienced this year because of the lower number of returns and based on all the analysis that we've done, it's really the pandemic era filers that came in to get access to their stimulus into their tax credits. And those have, based on our own analysis, have really all now left in the category. One, we believe we'll get to sort of a more normal environment. That is really what drove the performance -- the lower performance than we expected this year. The second thing to get to your question around reacceleration, this is where I feel very good about the performance in an environment where there were lower returns with our TurboTax Live business. If you think about it, this is now $1 billion-plus business growing 19%. And I believe in the next several years, this will actually be the largest part of the TurboTax business. And it's really in context of getting after the $30 billion of TAM that is consumers that go to an assisted offering to get their taxes done or businesses that get their business tax done. And we believe based on what we learned this year with our full service offering that we have an enormous chance to be able to really penetrate at a much more accelerated rate as we look ahead. And therefore, very confident in not only our performance this year if you exclude the lower number of returns, but also the green shoots that we saw going into next year, inclusive of the fact that we had 5x of growth in the Credit Karma platform. And we learned a number of things that we're going to double down on going into next year. And let me couple that with your second question around AI, listen, I would say we were the ones four-plus years ago that said, and we're on the record, that we believe that AI will absolutely be disruptive. And it's why we made investments in data. Because AI, particularly generative AI, is really meaningless without data. And so, with the investments that we've made in having a 360 view of data for consumers and small businesses, we actually, Kash, see it as an incredible accelerant. And I'll just remind us of, we often talk about we have $300 billion TAM with 5% penetration. And most of our customers use Excel, Google Sheet, [indiscernible], whether it's a small business or a consumer, to manage their life, to manage their business or they go have a bookkeeper help them run their business. And the reason is it's 5%, because it's all comes down to confidence. So, we actually see our investments in the last four-plus years in data and AI with what we are now investing in with generative AI, we, for us, think it's an acceleration because we have incredible scale. We have data scale, AI scale, customer scale, and we have sort of rich data sets that is really undisputed, which means we can do things for customers that is hard for anybody else to do. So, we actually see it as an accelerant and we're excited about the possibilities, given the proof points that we've seen and given the investments that we are currently making. So that's the way we think about it. Yes, sure. Let me, Kirk, frame my answer in two dimensions. One, what we see across all small businesses on our platform and off of our platform. There's a couple of things that we see. One is, there is an impact to small businesses' revenue. They're still growing. It depends on the sector. But in aggregate, what we see is that they are still growing. But they also, depending on the sectors they serve, they have profit pressures. So if they're in real estate or if they're in lending, they certainly have more profit pressure than those that don't serve those sectors. We also see that customers -- we would -- we put them in the bucket of the older, more tenured customers, 70% of those customers actually have more cash reserves than they did pre-pandemic. It's more of the younger newer businesses that have started since the pandemic that generally they have less cash reserves than they [Technical Difficulty] sort of the state of the small businesses. They feel the impact and the pressure of the environment from consumer spending standpoint. But net-net, when you look in aggregate, they are still growing with some of the data points that I mentioned a moment ago. With that said, when we look at our platform, it's why we're just being -- continuing to be intentional about sharing the proof points that we shared today, our platform is not immune, but we are resilient. And so, when you look at some of the data points that we shared, our payments -- our total payments -- online payments volume is 20%, which is actually quite healthy, but it's down 5 points. At the same time, when we look at our overall performance across Mailchimp and QuickBooks, we actually are seeing strength in serving our mid-market customers and continuing to serve our customers that have been on the platform for a long time. The proof points that I shared was our customer growth in mid-market is strong, we're growing payroll -- U.S. payroll double digit, and we're actually seeing a migration to our higher-end payroll offerings. So, net-net, we are not immune, but we are resilient and we feel really good about the sustained growth that we've delivered and the trajectory of the KPIs that we see as we look into next year. Yes, sure, Keith, great question. Let me start with your share question. First and foremost, the majority of -- in fact, we would say close to all of those that came into the category of taxes to get access to their stimulus dollars and to their tax credits that were not tax filers before, almost all of them came into the do-it-yourself category because it was so much easier and faster to get access to, in essence, all their credit. And those are the filers that we see that have left the do-it-yourself category. The reason our share is down as actually pure math. We're the largest share player in the do-it-yourself category and we got the largest share of those folks that actually came in during the pandemic era. And when they left the category just by pure math and the cohort of customers numbers that we review in our retention, what we, in essence, see is those cohort of customers that came in that did not file taxes before to get access to credits are the ones that left, which is actually what gives us confidence when we look at our key retention cohorts looking ahead, but also our TurboTax Live performance that we talked about earlier. So that's where -- that's how the share plays out. It's pure math. We got the majority of them and when they left the category, they left TurboTax. In terms of extensions, yes, there's dollars attached to it, Keith. But in context of $14 billion company, it's really -- we don't consider it material. So that's why we didn't show and I didn't really spend much time talking about it. Was the last part of your question how sustained is that going forward? Okay. So thank you for the question. First of all, very consistent with what I've shared in the last probably 18 months or so, we felt and I felt very strongly that the opportunity that we had with Mailchimp is how we bring it together with QuickBooks to truly create one platform that becomes the source of truth for running your business. And in an environment where now we have access to, with our customers' permission, the data applying AI and generative AI, we can now shift the platform to a place where we can do everything for you and deliver insights to help you manage your cash flow, to help you grow your customers, and that's really the ultimate game changer that we are focused on. With that said, the thing that I've been very consistent with you all is that this is all about execution. So, all of the progress that you're seeing us talk about in Mailchimp is all better execution. It is not any macro tailwinds. This is from the talent that we've put in place at the leadership level and the talent that we have upgraded across Mailchimp to then end-to-end. We've been revamping the website. We have looking at business model innovation and our line-up that we've made improvements. We're improving the product. We're doubling down on mid-market. And not only getting our existing customers to understand what features and functionality that we have to deliver the benefit, which helps us with retention and expansion revenue, but also the new customers that we're getting, assisted onboarding and using a lot of our AI and virtual expert platform capability. So, those were sort of illustrative examples relative to why we're seeing paid conversion increase, paid customers increase or seeing better retention and better revenue per customer, it is all execution. And I expect this to continue to improve our execution, and coupling that with what we're doing across the QuickBooks platform, truly creating one platform that becomes a source of truth for your business. I am excited and bullish about the future possibilities of what we can do for small businesses, particularly with what's possible with data and gen AI. Sure, Scott. Let me take your first question. There are two assumptions that we are making based on all the data that we have and what we see from last year. One is, there was actually a lot more extensions last year than we view will take place this year even with the states that have pushed out. Plus last year, there were more filers. This is in the bucket of the pre-pandemic era or the pandemic era filers that came in to get their stimulus money in their tax credits. There was still a lot of those filers last year through July and little bit beyond. And so when we take out those filers, and we compare to the extensions last year, our view is that IRS will be down 2%, and so that has, of course, an impact, 2%, which has an impact on the performance that we talked about. Secondarily, we really did an incredible amount of analysis to make sure that we had an understanding of these pandemic era filers and are they all sort of out. And the reality is there's no more stimulus or tax credits to be had by those filers. So based on all of our analysis, they are out. And so therefore, we expect this year that IRS at a minimum is going to be flat. And of course, when we guide, we'll share with you what we've assumed in our guidance in August. But we would assume, at a minimum, it will be flat, maybe even up, but at a minimum, flat based on the reasons that I just mentioned. So that's the first part of your question. The second part of your question is a really good one, and I'll get to the specifics in a moment. I think just sort of reiterate even in an environment where IRS returns went down, our future is TurboTax Live. And our future is the growth of what we can do with our Live platform, especially with the data and AI capabilities. We have to really disrupt the assisted segment. And our real [accompass] (ph) going forward is going to be the growth of our TurboTax Live platform both in terms of customer growth and revenue growth. And I may just ask Michelle to weigh in on this, but this sort of comes down to just pure math in terms of when we look at our units and we look at what folks paid for and sort of adds up to the 12 point speed up in ARPC. It's really nothing beyond that. But let me just ask Michelle. Michelle, would you weigh in on that point at all beyond what I just shared? Got it. So the headline is, the 12 point in ARPC growth is sort of very tangible relative to the units that we got. Yes. Sure, Daniel. First of all, yes, you're right in what you heard us say earlier, which is we would expect retention to be down 1 point-plus. And we'll talk about it, of course, more at Investor Day. And it's really because of these pandemic-era filers that came in and have now left the categories. Overall, we like the mix of what we've seen across our Live platform, and we'll share again more of the specifics as we get into Investor Day. But our retention and sort of existing customers coming back, we felt very good about what we expected and what we saw. I would say the second thing is it's a mix. It's a mix of both those that did taxes themselves the prior year that ultimately chose to upgrade to a sort of a Live platform because something changed in their life, inclusive of getting customers that were prior year assisted. And remember, our -- really, our competition is those that go to mom-and-pop shop. It's the 88 million folks where the majority of them will ultimately go to a local mom-and-pop shop to get their taxes done, and that's where we get a lot of the switches also from those mom-and-pop shops. So, we have a good mix of retention. Those that did taxes themselves last year and chose to use the Live platform because of a confidence question or some concern and then getting those that were prior assisted. And that's a mix we like, and that's a mix we believe will continue. Now it will be different as we take full service to either further scale, because we believe we'll accelerate full service penetration at a much higher rate than even today. So that's the way I would have you think about it. We're actually continuing to see strength based on our innovation in a couple of areas. One is in cards and in some parts driven by our Karma Guarantee, which is really unique to Credit Karma, where the certainty is very high for a member to get approved for what they are looking for because of the data and AI capabilities that we have. The second is Credit Karma Money. And this is where, as I always have shared, we are building a consumer platform to be the destination for consumers with the integrations that we're doing with TurboTax and Credit Karma. And in essence, we saw a 45% increase in the number of TurboTax customers that chose to put their money on a Credit Karma Money account. And not only do we make some revenue on that, but over time, based on the higher frequency of the engagement, we can ultimately monetize even further, which were not in the numbers that I just mentioned. So really, it's across our innovation across cards and Credit Karma Money. That's why we saw the performance that we saw in the quarter. And then with one quarter left in the year, we, of course, have confidence to improve the guidance that we provided to what Michelle shared earlier. Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I'll share a couple of perspectives that is really consistent with what we've talked about, but this is probably an important time to reiterate how we think about it. First and foremost, I can't vouch for their study. I can simply vouch for the facts that we have and the facts that are already in the market. And I think the first one is free tax software is already available to all consumers, and the awareness is actually quite high. That's the first thing that I would just remind us of. I think the second thing I would say is a reminder of this will yet be another free tax software in the marketplace. And I would just say, if you look at the last four-plus years, there were several entrants, big entrants, into the free tax software. One was Credit Karma before we acquired them, where they have 100 million-plus customers, a trusted platform. And they entered into the market of providing free tax software with sort of very little to no impact. And then another very large player that we sold Credit Karma tax to when we acquired Credit Karma. And you can, of course, observe what their results are. The point is that free tax software is already available, has been available to every consumer, and the awareness is extremely high. And so to have another sort of free tax software that's available is really immaterial is the way we think about it. And I'll remind us, by the way, it's actually not free. This is going to cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and so it's really not free. And I think the last thing I would say is really back to our vision. Our vision has been from what we declared four years ago to really become a consumer platform of choice, which means that beyond serving you to help you get your taxes done, we're delivering benefits through Credit Karma beyond tax, which means we can monetize beyond tax. And really out of the $35 billion TAM in tax, less than $5 billion to do-it-yourself. And really, our biggest opportunity is the other $30 billion we're going after, $20 billion of it being consumers that have somebody else get their taxes done and $10 billion being business tax. That's our future. That's our presence. That's where we are focused. And so net-net, when I think about the IRS study that was announced, I think it's a study. Facts are friendly, you look at the facts in the marketplace, this is for us, this is really not a threat at all. Yes. Sure, Brad. A couple of things. You actually nailed that our ARPU increase on top of ARPU increases in the last several years has come from TurboTax Live. It is a disruptive price offering. At the same time, it's got much higher ARPU and some of the more premium customers that chose -- they're either self-employed or they're investors and, of course, chose our premium SKU, which has a higher ARPU. So those are a couple of big drivers. I would tell you that the thing that I am sort of most excited about where the insights and the learnings that we got this year that really informs what we're going to double down on right now as we prepare for next year. One is full service. Full service is not an offering that is -- has product market fit. It's at scale. It -- we got an 84 Net Promoter Score this year, which is the highest Net Promoter of anything across the company we have ever had. And you've heard me say it before around Credit Karma, well, this is even a higher Net Promoter. And that contributed to a small amount this year because we were really being thoughtful and careful about ensuring we get to -- we have the right product market fit and we can deliver for customers. Well, we surprised ourselves in terms of the product market fit, and we're going to be really intentional about doubling down on that next year. I think I would say the other thing, back to your question around learning, is we really learned where and how experts. And remember, experts is not just human. It's both our AI and generative AI capabilities and/or humans depending on the need of the customer engaging around the money experience, helping customers understand their refund, changes in their refund or their balance due and changes in their balance due. We learned, coupled with our go-to-market strategy, how to really nail that benefit, and that's what drove the growth. But we believe we are capable of so much more growth as we look ahead based on the insights we got towards the end of the season, and that's what we'll be focused on as we head into next year. Yes. Just to say thank you for all your great questions, and many thanks to our employees and customers for their amazing focus and being part of this storied franchise, and we look forward to seeing all of you at next earnings. Thank you, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Intuit Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Abby. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's second quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As you read in our press release, we announced that Michelle will step down from the CFO role and plans to retire from Intuit. I'm pleased to share that Sandeep Aujla will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on August 1, 2023. It is a well-crafted succession plan that will cover more in a few minutes, but let's first get started with the business. We had another strong quarter, as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew 14%, fueled by Small Business & Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 20% and Consumer revenue growth of 26%. This year, we are celebrating Intuit's 40th anniversary. We're incredibly proud of our history of reimagining the company and reinventing ourselves, which has enabled us to thrive during various technological shifts and economic cycles. Having successfully navigated multiple platform ships over the years, including our largest transformation to artificial intelligence in the era of digitization, we continue to be confident in our ability to fuel growth, given our large TAM, low penetration, proven strategy and 5 Big Bets. We are proud to be the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities that we serve. I will first start with some thoughts about the tax season and our business in the current macro environment. As you know, the scale of our platform and rich data, gives us unique insights into the lives and spending habits of 100 million-plus customers. Our Small Business performance continues to be very strong, despite uncertainty in the broader macro environment. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including the growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q2, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remains strong. Total online payments volume grew 25%, moderating some from the first quarter. We are seeing strong growth in the number of payment-enabled invoices set by our Small Business customers, a good sign that our innovation is continuing to drive digitization. The shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform, including QuickBooks and MailChimp, resonate with customers as they grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to observe that our AI-driven expert platform is critical to our customers' success. Now turning to tax. We're confident in our strategy to both extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category. Following a highly successful extension season last year, we doubled down on our learning's to further accelerate innovation to better serve our customers. First, we're evolving our TurboTax brand to increase awareness that we are the best alternative in the assisted tax segment for consumers and small businesses, a combined $30 billion TAM. Our new campaign, Come to TurboTax and Don't do your taxes is resonating with our customers and is the key to our strategy as we focus on attracting customers from the assisted segment. Second, we launched a number of high-impact TurboTax Live innovation. As part of our second Big Bet, we are solving one of the largest problems our customer's face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. Building on our learning's from last season, we're continuing to use AI to bring in our customers' data and match them to the right experts to help customers get the maximum refund they deserve with confidence. To help customers finish their taxes even more quickly. We've created a new gamified experience focused on efficiency, backed by our lifetime guarantee. We evolved our full-service offering, so filers can have their return completed in a single virtual session. We are off to a great start in tax, and we continue to be confident in our game plan to win. Now shifting to our 5 Big Bets, I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress. As a reminder, our Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. In addition to what I've shared about TurboTax Live, we've achieved product market fit with QuickBooks Live, which we expect could help us penetrate non-consumption and drive breakthrough adoption. We're evolving our QuickBooks Live into a portfolio of expert services and are embedding these services as part of our lineup, similar to TurboTax Live. In the second quarter, we launched a three expert-guided setup available for all new QBO customers leveraging our virtual expert platform. Early results indicate that customers using this offering have more confidence in and awareness of our full ecosystem of services, which translate into better retention and higher adoption of our service offerings. With our third Big Bet, our vision for Credit Karma is to become the comprehensive self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward, wherever they are on their financial journey. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. We're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress, including improving their credit score with the help of Credit Karma Money. For example, with the integration of TurboTax and Credit Karma, approved members can get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepts their return. As this is the largest paycheck of the year for many, this enables them to take care of immediate expenses, pay down debt or build savings. Members also receive recommendations for how to achieve their financial goals, such as creating an emergency savings fund with our high-yield savings account or building credit with credit builder. Members who activate credit builders see an average score increase of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days. Members who use Credit Karma Money show higher engagement on the Credit Karma platform. We are driving more confidence for members with Karma Guarantee. As a reminder, Karma Guarantee offers indicate that members will either be approved or they'll receive $50. At the end of the quarter, 59% of members were eligible for at least one Karma Guarantee offer. With Mint now part of the Credit Karma platform, we're beginning to build a new experience for members with prime credit scores, which Credit Karma is underpenetrated in today. Leveraging Mint, we see the opportunity to develop personalized product recommendations, levering gene net worth, transaction and spend data to highlight the product benefits that matter most to these members. Our fourth Big Bets is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We continue to innovate to digitize money movement from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. And we are making meaningful progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. This quarter, we launched a QuickBooks business network to millions of QuickBooks customers to further digitize B2B payments in the U S. We're also building our Bill Pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. Now turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made some great progress against these priorities. To help our small businesses customers run and grow their business in one place, we launched a real-time data sync that brings QBO data such as invoices, sales receipts, items, customers and addresses into mail channel. This puts customer and purchase data together all in one place to power our customers' success. To help our customers plan, execute and track their marketing campaigns across multiple channels in one place, we launched a new capability called Campaign Manager. This reduces the number of tools needed to manage marketing and assess performance across channels. And to drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages, including Spanish and Portuguese. And beyond the progress we've made on these priorities, the product lineup innovation, assisted onboarding and improved first-time use we shared last quarter, is driving green shoots in paid conversion, which was up 2 points year-over-year in the second quarter. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. As I mentioned earlier, online mid-market customer growth remained strong, and we are seeing increased adoption of QBO Advanced, payments and payroll, driving ARPC expansion, as we serve these customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. And in an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever to our customers. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $3 billion; GAAP operating income of $270 million versus $56 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $856 million versus $612 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60 versus $0.35 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.20 versus $1.55 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and online ecosystem revenue grew 24%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business & Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 27% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q2. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter was up low teens. Growth was driven by higher effective prices, aligning with our pricing for value philosophy and improving conversion. We will continue to provide regular updates on the business, so you can track our performance over time, including a deeper dive at Investor Day, similar to what we do for the rest of the business. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 17% in Q2. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter. The subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable. And we raised our desktop prices for several products in September, to more closely align with pricing for value. We're about halfway through the three-year transition to a subscription model for Desktop. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high teens during the quarter. We expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth, as we progress through the back half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. We remain confident in our guidance for total Small Business and Self-Employed group of 19% to 20% revenue growth this year. Consumer Group revenue of $516 million grew 26% in Q2, reflecting a faster forming season this year. We remain confident in our guidance for Consumer Group of 9% to 10% revenue growth for fiscal 2023. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue grew 7% in Q2, in line with our expectations. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, down 16%. This was slightly ahead of our expectations in its seasonally smaller quarter. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. We continue to see an impact across all verticals in this uncertain macro environment. In credit cards, we continue to see partners tighten eligibility in riskier cohorts. In personal loans, we continue to see pressure as partner's further tightened eligibility, and we expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We remain confident in our guidance of a decline of 15% to 10% in fiscal 2023. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $7.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $500 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable April 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared consistently in the past several quarters, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offsets. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13% and non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%. GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.82 to $6.89 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.42 to $8.49. You can also find, our full fiscal 2023 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. On a personal note, as we announced today, I will be stepping down as CFO on July 31 and made it a priority over the last several years to focus on our long-term strategy for driving growth, and that includes ensuring I have a high-performing finance team with strong succession plans in place. Sandeep has been an integral part of the finance leadership team for over seven years, and I have no doubt he will be a terrific leader and CFO. He has shown his ability to drive key strategic priorities to create value for our business, time and time again, and I look forward to working with him over the next five months to ensure upcoming transition. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. Well, while the CFO transition isn't official until August, I wanted to just take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for all that Michelle has contributed over the past 20 years at Intuit including the last five years as CFO. She has been an amazing partner and will leave Intuit better than what she founded. And during Michelle's tenure as CFO, Intuit's market cap and revenue more than doubled. Michelle's commitment to developing top and diverse talent has created a deep bench of strong leaders, making firm a very seamless transition. Sandeep will be an exceptional CFO and with his track record of leading outstanding performance across our Small Business and Self-Employed Group and our technology organizations. So with that, let me go ahead and summarize. We are seeing continued momentum as we execute on our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform and growing Intuit revenue double-digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation, and the additional -- the additions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We're proud that Intuit has been named number five, on Fortune's Most Admired Company in the software category, one of Glassdoor's 2023 Best Places to Work and honored to be including -- included among Just Capital's Just 100 ranking for 2023. With that, let's now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nChirag Ved: This is Chirag Ved, dialing in for Kirk. I really appreciate you taking the question and congratulations on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about what you're seeing in QuickBooks online growth, both from new customers and from upselling existing customers. Just any commentary you might be able to provide around the dynamics there? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I would lead with -- we're seeing strength both in terms of customer acquisition, retention, we are seeing strength in our services. As we mentioned a moment ago, both the number of companies that are running payroll, the number of employees that are getting paid is very strong. We're -- if you compare our results to what you're seeing in the marketplace, we are continuing to grow payments 25%, total payments charge volume, which is really outstanding because of the fact that our customers are continuing to benefit from digitizing on our platform. And I think just the additive piece is we're seeing strength in mid-market, which is much higher ARPC and we're quite excited about really being able to pursue non-consumption with what we talked about earlier with QuickBooks Live actually being embedded as part of our overall offering. And I would just end with one of the goals that we talked about with all of you four years ago, our bold 2025 goals. One of those goals was that, we wanted the success rate of small businesses on our platform to be 10 points better than industry. And in fact, the small businesses on our platform, their performance is north of 15 points better than anyone in the industry. And what that just suggests is that, the small businesses on our platform are more successful, they're digitizing and they're leveraging this opportunity to continue to accelerate to deliver for their customers.\nChirag Ved: All right. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. And Sasan, it's a great quarter. I think what's impressive is your small business growth in this macro environment, like when some of your peers are talking about, like push out digital transformation in small business, some weakness. So I just wanted to ask, what you were seeing in terms of like for the next few quarters, like you look at a lot of data. What kind of -- what sort of health you are seeing in the SMB economy right now? And it looks like your second half is pretty easy comp right now. So would love to hear your comments on small business.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, for sure, Siti. Thank you so much for your question. And it's actually a really important question in terms of what we've often talked about, which is, it's important that you all look at Intuit as really the authority when it comes to what's happening in the small business space. And the reason is that, our platform is mission-critical for small businesses. Our platform with QuickBooks, Mailchimp and all the services that we have on our platform, is really used by small businesses to be able to grow customers, manage their customers, manage their cash flow, be able to manage their employees end-to-end. And therefore, what that means is, it fuels our success, supported by the stat I shared a moment ago, where small businesses that are on our platform are actually 15-plus points more successful than those that are not on our platform. And so, I set that very important context, and I'll just point to payments total charge volume as an example. When you look at our performance being at 25%, that is, by far, the best in the industry. And that is because, it is all about digitization. And it's not just about payments, but it's about all the services that our small businesses use on our platform. And we expect our small businesses to continue to be successful, even in this macro environment, and we are here to support them. I will just end by saying the following, which I think you were hinting at this in your question. The strength of our businesses, as Michelle and I described a moment ago, and we expect that strength to continue, although, when you look at our guidance, I think the way you should look at our guidance is that it has been de-risked for sure, for the rest of the year.\nSiti Panigrahi: Great. And a quick follow-up, basically clarification. Your online services growth, 21%, but if I exclude Mailchimp, it's around 27% growth. That's quite impressive, like just compared to like Q1, 28%. Just want to clarify that I'm looking at it right.\nSasan Goodarzi: You are -- we didn't break out the number. But, yes, you're looking at it right, because, in essence, online services, minus, Mailchimp grew faster. So therefore, just by design, it grew much faster than 21%. So you are correct.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. I appreciate you taking the question. Nice job on the quarter. Maybe one for Michelle while you're still with us, on margin. Last quarter, you took the Credit Karma outlook down but left the EPS guide intact. We've gotten questions from investors around whether that provides maybe less wiggle room on margin, but the first couple of quarters have still shown EPS upside. So can you just walk through the margin levers you're finding? Are there advantages in folding various brands together and just how we should think about the longer-term margin potential there?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate the question. We \u2013 yes, we absolutely have felt very strongly about being able to still keep our guidance for op income for margin, even though we did take down our revenue guidance last quarter. And that's actually something that we were very plantful about as we went through our three in one year planning process. We had identified a number of levers that we could pull across the expense horizon. A lot of that is in marketing. Some of it's in travel and some other discretionary type expenses so that we would be able to still hit our bottom line financial commitments and that's what we have done. And we feel very good about the guidance that we've given for the rest of the year. But it is something that we take very seriously, and we make sure that we do have those levers that we can pull, given different macro environment as that has unfolded this year.\nMichael Turrin: It's very helpful. Just one more, if I may. The desktop business came in exceptionally strong. Can you just speak to what you're finding as you move that base for subscription? And then how to think about the revised small business target after we're through the migration journey there and what keeps the 15% growth sustained afterwards. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Michael, maybe I will take that. First of all, I'll just start with context. This is a business model shift that we're actually quite excited about in that. One, we've shifted the customers to subscription, so it's far more predictable. Two, in that context, we have had a very planful process of aligning prices between desktop and our online products. And the reason this is really important is we've been heavily investing in the last several years really ensuring that some of the key capabilities for our desktop customers, particularly those product-based businesses, that those capabilities are available in online. And being in the middle of this business model transition, one, we see another 1.5 years of continued strength, but we also see ahead of that, the fact that we can now migrate these customers through our online platform, because we now have the capabilities that they need. And by the way, when we do that \u2013 that actually opens up the doors to additional online services to continue to fuel the success of our small businesses. And therefore, when you step back, ultimately, the growth of this franchise will come from online. And with all of the innovation growth levers we have, moving up-market, that is what continues to give us a lot of confidence in our 15% to 20% long-term expectations for the small business franchise.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. And I\u2019ll add my congratulations. I was wondering if you can drill down into the favorable trend that you're seeing from higher effective prices. In particular, for QuickBooks Online Accounting, just in terms of the magnitude and the duration of that impact. And I'm curious if that should continue to provide any kind of material uplift for the next several quarters.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thanks for your question, Mark. Let me start with context that we always look at our largest growth across the company, no matter what the business is to come from volume and mix. And those two are driven, of course, by our innovation and/or if we are moving up market, which in many cases across our businesses, we are moving upmarket. In TurboTax, the example is moving into the assisted segment. So price and mix are really the largest drivers. And because of just the vast and accelerated innovation, we also have price as a leverage because we always want to be disruptive from the bottom, and we want to continue to disrupt at the top. And that actually gives us a lot of pricing power because of the value equation and the benefits that we deliver for our customers. And so with that as context, looking ahead, not just the next couple of quarters, but looking in terms of just the long-term durability of Intuit and how we think about things, we believe the majority of our growth will continue to come from volume and mix and price will always be a lever because particularly that we are moving upmarket. And I think it was even more pronounced in small business because of the business model shift in desktop, where we are bringing pricing to parity with online and we just -- we expect that to continue in the next several quarters, but that there's a durability element of this, not just a quarterly element for this.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Understood. And then as a quick follow-up, on the Mailchimp side, are the initiatives that are designed to stimulate higher growth for MailChimp, which I think has been including the very creative advertising campaigns you've had out there. Are those starting to take hold and produce an effect in terms of whether we look at e-mail marketing, campaign volumes or seeing customers opt in to the right products there where they run the AB test and kind of connect back with the rest of the ecosystem. Is that something you see starting to take hold currently or in the next couple of quarters as well?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Mark, I would say that when you think about the priorities that we talked about in the focus areas, we are starting to see green shoots, and we started seeing green shoots a couple of quarters ago. And sort of the biggest one is conversion in paid. The one -- in addition to the initiatives starting to deliver green shoots that we are the most excited about is the work that we are doing to retain our high-value customers and to really penetrate in mid-market. This is really the same story that we talked about in mid-market with QuickBooks Advance, where our retention was actually not quite that high when it came to our high-value customers in QuickBooks. And we built a platform and really a team to focus on these mid-market customers. And that is really one that I'm very excited about, and I think we'll see the results of that in the next two to three quarters, where we'll start making a bigger impact in not only retaining our high-value customers, but also penetration in mid-market. And that's also in context of all the other things that we've talked about doing, which is campaign redesign, web redesign, first-time use, one-hour assisted onboarding and now what we just shared earlier in the script, which we said it's coming, and that is the Data Sync. The Data Sync is huge, because now it puts the customer data and purchase data all in one place, and it really puts the power of growth in the hands of customers in a way where they can't get that fuel anywhere else. And so, all these things take time, but we are seeing the green shoots. It will translate into faster revenue growth, sort of, in the coming quarters, which is, by the way, not embedded in our guidance, just to be clear, but we're excited about the progress that we're making.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question. Sasan, I think everyone appreciates what's happening in Credit Karma, and there's only so much that's within your control. And within that context, it's great to hear all the goodness around how Credit Karma Guarantee is doing. But as we think about the other elements of the portfolio, the other products, in an environment that's supply-constrained, can you maybe just talk about the performance and how you're investing against the opportunity in context of what you can control? And how do you even know the progress perhaps that you're making in auto and in home, for example, if the market just isn't there to support it. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Brad, actually, a great question. And the reason it's such an important question is, we are very focused on delivering for our members in the near term and to your point, leading to this macro environment, but we are undeterred relative to the strategic focus areas for the business. And so, let me specifically answer your questions. First of all, let me start with a macro point, which applies to all of Intuit. At Intuit, there are outcomes that we declare that we monitor, but there are also inputs that we focus on. And inputs are key deliverables around product, around go-to-market, around technology investments, and each of our inputs have success measures. And we spend the majority of our time on inputs, because managing inputs and managing where you choose to invest is ultimately the biggest predictor of the outcomes that we want to achieve. So we're very intentional about delivering and managing in the near term for our customers and for you all, and we are undeterred relative to the focus areas that we are focused on in the long term, which are the inputs. With that as sort of uber context in terms of how we run the company, there are several areas that we continue to be focused on, and they're not new, but this is why we believe in the long-term growth of Credit Karma. One is Karma Guarantee. By the way, somebody is typing. So, hopefully, you all can hear me. But Karma Guarantee is a big time differentiator. This is where we use our data and our machine learning capabilities to, in essence, provide certainty that a customer is eligible for a credit card or a personal loan. And now 59% of our members are actually able to get a Karma Guarantee offer, which is a huge deal. We're continuing to invest in that area with our financial institutions and getting financial institutions onto our light box. The second is Credit Karma Money. This is huge, right? This is building out the other side of Credit Karma platform where, in essence, we're helping our members manage money, whether it's paying bills, early access to their money, early access of their refund, building their credit, finding ways to save money. And the more we -- members engage with Credit Karma money, the more their engagement goes up on the platform and the more we can monetize. So that's the second area. And the third area is what we've talked about in the last several quarters, which is our focus on prime customers. This is why we put Mint and Credit Karma together. We're very underpenetrated with our prime members, and we're building out services. And when we launch them, well, of course, you'll be the first to know to really begin to penetrate and monetize prime customers. And last but not least, this is very important. It's better together with TurboTax. It's all the investments that we are making because our goal is we want every Credit Karma member to use TurboTax, and we want every TurboTax customer to put their refund on Credit Karma Money account. So those are the four big areas of focus.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much for that, Sasan. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, maybe Michelle. Michelle, I appreciate that cash flow is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. It looks like cash taxes had an impact in the first half of the year on free cash flow growth. But -- just in trying to reconcile your margin upside in the quarter with free cash flow performance, are there any items to call out? Any reasons why for the full year, we shouldn't expect free cash flow growth to be somewhat in line with net income growth? Thanks.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks for the question, Brad. Typically, that is exactly what we would expect. So I would say that this year, we could pretty much expect the same \u2013 that same trend to continue. Yes, we are going to have the lumpiness as we've always talked about, we have that throughout the year and given the way our quarters fall with tax and so forth. But yeah, I would expect that you would see that trend continue for the year.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question here on TurboTax Full Service given that this is the first year that you're really making a push here with the offering and then we're getting into the tax season. Curious to get your perspective on whether you think this year might be the year you might see more conversion of existing TurboTax filers to full service or is this more of a net new filer coming into the franchise through full service or maybe over time, you shift more towards the latter as the brand gains some traction. Just curious on your expectations there, net new versus existing filers upgrading?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brad. In fact, I'll start with something that we mentioned earlier, but it's really important in the context of your question, and that is our entire campaign strategy and all the investments that we've made in TurboTax Live as a platform has been to bring in prior year assisted customers. And these prior year \u2013 and by the way, our campaign, we'll talk about it in more detail right after tax season. But our campaign is certainly raising heads, and we are seeing more prior year-assisted customers come into the franchise because they see it as a great opportunity to digitally get their taxes done from wherever they are and get the expert help that they need. With that said, the way we think about TurboTax Live is it's really one platform. We are -- we don't look at like full service as just an attach. We look at -- there are those that will come in and choose to get help along the way. And there are those that will come in and digitally exchange all of the documents, had appointment, and have a discussion with our \u2013 expert that's been matched with them and then have us do their taxes for them. And I think we see the type of strength that we would have expected in this area in the \u2013 where we are in the season. With full service, you see more of that strength more towards the latter part of the season. But we're pleased with the halo effect that really it creates because that's what we're really after is to ensure that we communicate and deliver on the promise of, if you want to help with your taxes or you want us to do it for you, we're here for you. And it's the combination of that both campaign strategy and platform delivering on that promise. That is what we look for. With that said, the big change this year is one session virtual engagement where we can get your taxes one and done, and we're seeing success there. And I would also just say we're going to see a lot more sort of in March and April, and that's where this full-service offering will have the largest impact.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Enders from Citi. Your line is open.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just to follow up on the last TurboTax line questioning. I guess, so far, what have you seen in terms of kind of the broader adoption of some of those more full service offerings or even TurboTax Live in terms of driving the upside in the quarter? And I guess from a referral standpoint between credit card and TurboTax, I guess what kind of engagement have you seen between the two of those that drive that co-branded offering out there?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Very good question. A couple of things that I'll say. First of all, Steve, as we talked about earlier, we have just had a faster forming season this year, which is great because we're able to not only deliver for our customers, but these are folks that really need their money fast and we've seen a really strong uptake of putting their money on a Credit Karma Money account, which is exactly why we've got the integration between those two platforms. The second thing I would say, and of course, we'll share more tangible results when season is over. But I'm actually quite excited about what we are seeing this year relative to Credit Karma members, in essence, engaging with TurboTax. We spent a lot of sort of our investments in time this past five, six months to remove friction, to remove blockers, to make it much easier if you're a member to pick the right product and then get your taxes done, whether you want to do it yourself or we'll do it for you. So we're seeing good engagement on that front. And I think just last but not least, we're seeing strength with returning customers that use TurboTax Live coming back this year. And again, it's very early in the season. We're actually excited about all the possibilities of acquiring new customers as we look at the rest of the season, particularly because of our campaign. That's raised a lot of heads that we typically wouldn't have raised. So more to come when season is over. And by the way, we're iterating real-time, making product improvements real-time, launching new features every seven days. So we're excited about the game that's ahead of us and where we are as we sit today.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Great. There's helpful context there. And just a quick one, if I could get it in here on -- and just on the EPS outlook, I guess, how should we think about what's being put more to work on in terms of the marketing, how much more is getting kind of being put to work there versus conservatism, such as inherent in the model at this point because just seeing really good upside in the past couple of quarters and not necessarily seeing a raise on the EPS side. So just would love to kind of get your thoughts on that.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, yes, absolutely. It's a very, very good question because if you just do the math, what we've delivered the first half of the year and you look at where we're going to deliver the second half of the year, it would suggest significant deceleration. So thank you for asking the question. I would say everything that we talked about across all the businesses stands. We're confident in our guidance and we're confident in what we're seeing in the businesses and where each business sits. I think the reality is, generally, we have a principle, we don't touch our guidance while we're heading into our third quarter. Our third quarter is double the revenue of any other quarter. And so, we'd like to get to the third quarter and then talk to you all about what our guidance is moving forward. So really, the way you should think about our guidance is it's derisked.\nSteve Enders: Perfect. Appreciate taking the questions.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, absolutely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, very much. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Michelle, we\u2019ll definitely miss your smile and energy. Sandeep, look forward to working with you. Back to you, Sasan. You digitized taxes, which were done annually, what not like decades ago. Now you're about to digitize payments. I'm curious, as you look at payments, what are the parts of the payments ecosystem that Intuit is not traditionally played in. I know that you've quantified $125 billion of transactions going through your network, vis-\u00e0-vis $2 trillion or so that's transacted more broadly speaking. And listen to your comments on payments, it sounds like that is the big kahuna here. You can demystify what parts of the payments ecosystem has Intuit not participated in before and which parts would you be able to participate in going forward? You mentioned B2B, accounts payable, receivable, et cetera, that would help frame how much of an opportunity payments is. It's a small -- it's one of your smallest businesses, but it looks like it's got the biggest growth potential. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for the question, Kash. And I just have to start by saying, we've got a lot of octane in the tank left across all of our Big Bets. I love all of my five children. But I'll answer your question around payments. I think there are three things. And let me -- 30 seconds of context, and I'll specifically answer your question, because we talked about payments and money movement a lot. One huge element of what happens on our platform is, small businesses come in, they create an estimate, they invoice and then they need to get paid for that invoice once they do the work. And our penetration in that -- we talk often about we have $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. Our penetration there is still low. And so, it's just important to start there and not move off of that, because that's a huge growth opportunity. It's a huge area of investment. And by the way, why in this macro environment where everybody's payments volumes are not accelerating or they're significantly decelerating, we still have 25% total charge volume growth. So that's number one. There's a lot of octane left there, and we are significantly focused. I think the other one that we've traditionally not focused on at all, is this entire B2B network, which is digitizing business to business between our small businesses. We now have the capabilities. We launched the business network last quarter to millions of our QuickBooks customers. That is a big opportunity, of course, very low -- no penetration, because we didn't have it before, and it's 70% checks. So that's a big one. And then part of that is also just bill pay capabilities, which we've had on our platform through a couple of really strong partners. And now we're building that capability ourselves, because we believe that it can deliver a far seamless experience for our customers. And then, when you take all of that and go to mid-market, it's even a bigger opportunity, which is why we're seeing the strength in our mid-market growth, because of just the size of payments and payroll that takes place. So, hopefully, that answers your question\nKash Rangan: That is allowing you to participate in these vectors that you couldn't previously access. And that's it for me. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Congratulations Michelle and Sandeep. Sasan, first question is going to be in tax category. It's kind of a multi-partner. Yeah. This the early season in the industry, the IRS is clearly up year-over-year significantly, and that's probably good for you in multi \u2013 for multiple reasons, like you just mentioned, the Credit Karma Money probably helped. But \u2013 just love your thoughts on the industry, why you think it's up so much this year versus last year to start and then it's still way behind in -- through mid-February versus pre-pandemic. So just kind of high-level thoughts on the kind of the cadence of this tax season, the start and how that may influence the tax season and your view of it overall? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott. I love the question, because this is actually important for everybody to hear since you see the IRS reports on a weekly basis. It's almost \u2013 if I were to tell you all, it's almost hard for you all to pay attention to these reports because so much has changed and will continue to change. So let me start with context. Before COVID, before 2020, things were generally predictable, but things were continuing year in and year out to get pushed out to April. What do I mean by predictable. Generally, you would see a strong first peak, which went through mid-February and it would start end of January, and then you would sort of have very low volume and then you would have a lot of volume come in on the 14th and 15th of April. And what was happening every year, that curve was predictable \u2013 about what's happening is every year, more and more people pushed out to do their taxes on the 14 and 15 because there were solutions like ours where they could wait until last minute to do it. So that was pre-COVID. When COVID hit, when everybody sort of was locked up in their homes, when tax season got extended two years in a row, and now the fact that folks are actually working virtually, it completely blew up the curve and the habits of customers. And so what we are now seeing this season is initially, we saw a fast forming season similar to what would happen pre-COVID. A lot of people came in because they needed money. And what we're seeing now is \u2013 what we've been seeing, which is a lot of people are pushing out to complete their taxes sort of last minute. But what's very difficult, I know for you all to compare, we have a lot of internal data so we can assess what's happening is that it's hard to compare year-over-year, because there's so much that changed in the last several years. And again, what we're seeing this year is now people are at work, but remember, they're still generally working in a hybrid environment. So even days of the week, times of the day when their taxes is not comparable to last year. But generally speaking, fast forming and then a bunch of people are going to do their taxes in the last several days of April before taxes are due is the way you should think about it.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks. I appreciate all that color. Next one, a follow-up. Over in Credit Karma Guarantee, you've discussed it a good bid on this call. But when you gave guidance for Credit Karma at the beginning of the year, you were really excited about Guarantee contributing in the back half. I may be a quarter or two early here asking this question. You mentioned the 59% penetration of the base. Just curious, how are you tracking this? Is this ahead of where you expected to be at this point? And could it be, in fact, a driver. You mentioned de-risk guidance for Credit Karma segment. Is this -- how are you progressing on Guarantee? Is this going to be really meaningful through the back half tax?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, yes, sure. First of all, let me start with my comments where the guidance for the company is derisked. That includes Credit Karma. So my comments weren't just about Credit Karma, it was really about the whole company because if you just do the math, it seems that we are significantly decelerating the second half of the year versus the first half of the year and that's the point I made, which is principally, we don't touch guidance until we get to our largest quarter, which is this quarter. And so therefore, the way to think about our guidance is that it's derisked. That includes Credit Karma. The second thing is, if you recall, when Michelle and I talked about when we reset the Credit Karma guidance to minus 15% to minus 10%, what we talked about is, one, we feel the new guidance was very prudent. We also really built in some deterioration in the second half of the year and we didn't count on our innovation having the kind of impact we initially had assumed in our first guidance. And I think that still stands. With that said, I actually feel very good about where we are. I would say we are where we want it to be because we have very high goals with Karma Guarantee. 59% of our members now having at least one Karma Guarantee offer is really a big deal. So I feel good in terms of the progress we're making on that front, the front of Credit Karma Money with the integration with TurboTax. Those are all -- our input goals in those areas are on track, and it will be fun to watch how they play out the rest of the year, but we're not relying on that to achieve our guidance.\nScott Schneeberger: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Sasan, online services was slower than QBO accounting at 27%. So I think I just wanted clarify, was the weakness really just in Mailchimp or was there any weakness you saw in payments or payroll?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Brent, two over points. The first one is you're always going to see toggling between online accounting growth rate and online services growth rate. What you really should pay attention to is the overall growth rate. With that said, to answer your question, we actually saw strength across the board. Mailchimp, our growth is what brought down the online services growth to 21% because it is growing slower then, of course, it's growing low teens, but it was really driven down by Mailchimp. And Mailchimp is growing low teens, similar to last quarter, but that was really the primary reason a little bit very small amount by payments now growing at 25%, but really, it's Mailchimp.\nBrent Thill: Follow-up on Mailchimp, do you feel that is more internal execution of getting the product right and not wanting to push it out until it's ready, or is there something competitive going on that you're seeing that's maybe distracting?\nSasan Goodarzi: No. It's really -- we have very clear priorities put great leaders in the business. I was actually just in Atlanta about three weeks ago, spent more than a day with the entire team, and it's just really execution. And I feel very good about the focus areas, the progress on our execution, it is in our control, which is sort of a great place to be in. It's not macro, it's us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. I guess, maybe just two quick ones. Sasan, first, if I count the amount of times you said derisk on this call with respect to the guidance, I think that's definitely great to hear, but if you think about like the KPIs that you're seeing in real time around the macro and the SMB, like, what would you say -- how would you compare them to the trend line that you saw last quarter and where do you see them kind of going from a macroeconomic perspective and influencing the demand environment?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Good question, Alex. Let me start with small business. And given that we have 10 million-plus small businesses on our platform and by the way, with the way they're digitizing it's probably best to just talk specifically about the data that we are seeing. If you go back to last quarter, what I had mentioned is, small businesses generally still have strong cash reserves. They're using some of those cash reserves to continue to invest in their business. And they're still hiring. They're still having a little bit of a hard time hiring, but they are still hiring. They couldn't find talent. But then there are sectors like financial services, real estate, auto that were down nearly 15% in revenue year-over-year. If I forwarded to the data that we're seeing now, this quarter, two things. One, they're continuing to hire, and they're actually finding it easier to hire. And those same industries that I just mentioned, real estate, financial services and auto have actually kicked off in performance. Their performance is better. Like, for instance, I think real estate and financial services are -- they were down like 15% plus, and now they're down less than 10% as an example. And auto, believe it or not, was down minus 2% versus the minus sort of 10% to 15%, it was down. So we're actually seeing an uptick and improved performance in our base in those areas that were actually hit the hardest. So that's sort of the macro environment that I would say. And I would actually reiterate what Michelle and I talked about earlier, which is, our focus and innovation on payments is working, because although consumer spending has moderated a bit, our total charge volume is growing 25%, which is quite healthy and significant. So that's what we're seeing on the small business side. On the Consumer side, two things I would say. And remember, we have nearly 100 million consumers on our platform. So this is really indicative of the world outside of our platform. Since March of last year, credit scores are down about 13 points and credit card balances are up a little bit over 20%. Those that are hit the hardest are those that are in the credit band of 600 to 660, where their average balance on their credit card is like $9,000. So that's the -- a little bit of the state of the world on the consumer side. Hopefully, that answers your question, Alex.\nAlex Zukin: Yes. That was actually extremely detailed. So I really appreciate that. And then, I guess, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you a question about generative AI and how we're, if at all, Intuit has plans to monetize or integrate that technology. It does seem like having your own personal financial digital assistant or a live plus functionality would kind of seem logical, but would be really interested to kind of get a sense of how you're all thinking about it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Alex, I'm glad you got it in. I'm surprised it took till the top of the hour for somebody to ask, so thank you for asking. It's actually a really important question. And I want to take you all back to \u2013 AI is core to our strategy. And now that everybody is talking about AI, I'm actually delighted because hopefully, it will expose to all of you why four years ago, when we refreshed our strategy, it was about being an AI-driven expert platform. And the investments that we've made in data and AI is really what's fueled a lot of our innovation across the company. And as you heard us talk about at Investor Day, it's why we put Marion in front of you all, we're just at the beginning of the curve as to what's possible. So first and foremost, the investments around data and AI is, what's fueling our success. And we've been looking at generative AI. In fact, there are multiple areas across our platform, where we've launch some of the capabilities of generative AI because it's all about reducing work and finding ways to put more money in your pocket with confidence, and it actually helps our experts. The key areas that we are focused on working with a couple of companies in this area is accuracy. And it will become more accurate over time, but we deal with people's money. And that matters in terms of the advice that we give. For us, this is all an accelerant, which, by the way, we've been working on for many, many, many months before this became sort of the buzz. But AI is core to our strategy. So we're delighted with the possibilities of the future.\nAlex Zukin: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Well, listen, thank you, everybody, for your time. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Once again, I want to thank Michelle for 20 years at Intuit. She'll be back with us, by the way. She's with us through August, and delighted with Sandeep joining us as our new CFO in August. But with that said, we'll talk to you at next earnings until then, be safe, be good. Talk soon. Bye, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $3 billion; GAAP operating income of $270 million versus $56 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $856 million versus $612 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60 versus $0.35 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.20 versus $1.55 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and online ecosystem revenue grew 24%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business & Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 27% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q2. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter was up low teens. Growth was driven by higher effective prices, aligning with our pricing for value philosophy and improving conversion. We will continue to provide regular updates on the business, so you can track our performance over time, including a deeper dive at Investor Day, similar to what we do for the rest of the business. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 17% in Q2. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter. The subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable. And we raised our desktop prices for several products in September, to more closely align with pricing for value. We're about halfway through the three-year transition to a subscription model for Desktop. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high teens during the quarter. We expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth, as we progress through the back half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. We remain confident in our guidance for total Small Business and Self-Employed group of 19% to 20% revenue growth this year. Consumer Group revenue of $516 million grew 26% in Q2, reflecting a faster forming season this year. We remain confident in our guidance for Consumer Group of 9% to 10% revenue growth for fiscal 2023. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue grew 7% in Q2, in line with our expectations. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, down 16%. This was slightly ahead of our expectations in its seasonally smaller quarter. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. We continue to see an impact across all verticals in this uncertain macro environment. In credit cards, we continue to see partners tighten eligibility in riskier cohorts. In personal loans, we continue to see pressure as partner's further tightened eligibility, and we expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We remain confident in our guidance of a decline of 15% to 10% in fiscal 2023. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $7.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $500 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable April 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared consistently in the past several quarters, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offsets. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13% and non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%. GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.82 to $6.89 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.42 to $8.49. You can also find, our full fiscal 2023 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. On a personal note, as we announced today, I will be stepping down as CFO on July 31 and made it a priority over the last several years to focus on our long-term strategy for driving growth, and that includes ensuring I have a high-performing finance team with strong succession plans in place. Sandeep has been an integral part of the finance leadership team for over seven years, and I have no doubt he will be a terrific leader and CFO. He has shown his ability to drive key strategic priorities to create value for our business, time and time again, and I look forward to working with him over the next five months to ensure upcoming transition. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Yes. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate the question. We \u2013 yes, we absolutely have felt very strongly about being able to still keep our guidance for op income for margin, even though we did take down our revenue guidance last quarter. And that's actually something that we were very plantful about as we went through our three in one year planning process. We had identified a number of levers that we could pull across the expense horizon. A lot of that is in marketing. Some of it's in travel and some other discretionary type expenses so that we would be able to still hit our bottom line financial commitments and that's what we have done. And we feel very good about the guidance that we've given for the rest of the year. But it is something that we take very seriously, and we make sure that we do have those levers that we can pull, given different macro environment as that has unfolded this year. Thanks for the question, Brad. Typically, that is exactly what we would expect. So I would say that this year, we could pretty much expect the same \u2013 that same trend to continue. Yes, we are going to have the lumpiness as we've always talked about, we have that throughout the year and given the way our quarters fall with tax and so forth. But yeah, I would expect that you would see that trend continue for the year."

            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As you read in our press release, we announced that Michelle will step down from the CFO role and plans to retire from Intuit. I'm pleased to share that Sandeep Aujla will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on August 1, 2023. It is a well-crafted succession plan that will cover more in a few minutes, but let's first get started with the business. We had another strong quarter, as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew 14%, fueled by Small Business & Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 20% and Consumer revenue growth of 26%. This year, we are celebrating Intuit's 40th anniversary. We're incredibly proud of our history of reimagining the company and reinventing ourselves, which has enabled us to thrive during various technological shifts and economic cycles. Having successfully navigated multiple platform ships over the years, including our largest transformation to artificial intelligence in the era of digitization, we continue to be confident in our ability to fuel growth, given our large TAM, low penetration, proven strategy and 5 Big Bets. We are proud to be the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities that we serve. I will first start with some thoughts about the tax season and our business in the current macro environment. As you know, the scale of our platform and rich data, gives us unique insights into the lives and spending habits of 100 million-plus customers. Our Small Business performance continues to be very strong, despite uncertainty in the broader macro environment. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including the growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q2, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remains strong. Total online payments volume grew 25%, moderating some from the first quarter. We are seeing strong growth in the number of payment-enabled invoices set by our Small Business customers, a good sign that our innovation is continuing to drive digitization. The shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform, including QuickBooks and MailChimp, resonate with customers as they grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to observe that our AI-driven expert platform is critical to our customers' success. Now turning to tax. We're confident in our strategy to both extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category. Following a highly successful extension season last year, we doubled down on our learning's to further accelerate innovation to better serve our customers. First, we're evolving our TurboTax brand to increase awareness that we are the best alternative in the assisted tax segment for consumers and small businesses, a combined $30 billion TAM. Our new campaign, Come to TurboTax and Don't do your taxes is resonating with our customers and is the key to our strategy as we focus on attracting customers from the assisted segment. Second, we launched a number of high-impact TurboTax Live innovation. As part of our second Big Bet, we are solving one of the largest problems our customer's face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. Building on our learning's from last season, we're continuing to use AI to bring in our customers' data and match them to the right experts to help customers get the maximum refund they deserve with confidence. To help customers finish their taxes even more quickly. We've created a new gamified experience focused on efficiency, backed by our lifetime guarantee. We evolved our full-service offering, so filers can have their return completed in a single virtual session. We are off to a great start in tax, and we continue to be confident in our game plan to win. Now shifting to our 5 Big Bets, I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress. As a reminder, our Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. In addition to what I've shared about TurboTax Live, we've achieved product market fit with QuickBooks Live, which we expect could help us penetrate non-consumption and drive breakthrough adoption. We're evolving our QuickBooks Live into a portfolio of expert services and are embedding these services as part of our lineup, similar to TurboTax Live. In the second quarter, we launched a three expert-guided setup available for all new QBO customers leveraging our virtual expert platform. Early results indicate that customers using this offering have more confidence in and awareness of our full ecosystem of services, which translate into better retention and higher adoption of our service offerings. With our third Big Bet, our vision for Credit Karma is to become the comprehensive self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward, wherever they are on their financial journey. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. We're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress, including improving their credit score with the help of Credit Karma Money. For example, with the integration of TurboTax and Credit Karma, approved members can get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepts their return. As this is the largest paycheck of the year for many, this enables them to take care of immediate expenses, pay down debt or build savings. Members also receive recommendations for how to achieve their financial goals, such as creating an emergency savings fund with our high-yield savings account or building credit with credit builder. Members who activate credit builders see an average score increase of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days. Members who use Credit Karma Money show higher engagement on the Credit Karma platform. We are driving more confidence for members with Karma Guarantee. As a reminder, Karma Guarantee offers indicate that members will either be approved or they'll receive $50. At the end of the quarter, 59% of members were eligible for at least one Karma Guarantee offer. With Mint now part of the Credit Karma platform, we're beginning to build a new experience for members with prime credit scores, which Credit Karma is underpenetrated in today. Leveraging Mint, we see the opportunity to develop personalized product recommendations, levering gene net worth, transaction and spend data to highlight the product benefits that matter most to these members. Our fourth Big Bets is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We continue to innovate to digitize money movement from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. And we are making meaningful progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. This quarter, we launched a QuickBooks business network to millions of QuickBooks customers to further digitize B2B payments in the U S. We're also building our Bill Pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. Now turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made some great progress against these priorities. To help our small businesses customers run and grow their business in one place, we launched a real-time data sync that brings QBO data such as invoices, sales receipts, items, customers and addresses into mail channel. This puts customer and purchase data together all in one place to power our customers' success. To help our customers plan, execute and track their marketing campaigns across multiple channels in one place, we launched a new capability called Campaign Manager. This reduces the number of tools needed to manage marketing and assess performance across channels. And to drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages, including Spanish and Portuguese. And beyond the progress we've made on these priorities, the product lineup innovation, assisted onboarding and improved first-time use we shared last quarter, is driving green shoots in paid conversion, which was up 2 points year-over-year in the second quarter. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. As I mentioned earlier, online mid-market customer growth remained strong, and we are seeing increased adoption of QBO Advanced, payments and payroll, driving ARPC expansion, as we serve these customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. And in an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever to our customers. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. Well, while the CFO transition isn't official until August, I wanted to just take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for all that Michelle has contributed over the past 20 years at Intuit including the last five years as CFO. She has been an amazing partner and will leave Intuit better than what she founded. And during Michelle's tenure as CFO, Intuit's market cap and revenue more than doubled. Michelle's commitment to developing top and diverse talent has created a deep bench of strong leaders, making firm a very seamless transition. Sandeep will be an exceptional CFO and with his track record of leading outstanding performance across our Small Business and Self-Employed Group and our technology organizations. So with that, let me go ahead and summarize. We are seeing continued momentum as we execute on our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform and growing Intuit revenue double-digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation, and the additional -- the additions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We're proud that Intuit has been named number five, on Fortune's Most Admired Company in the software category, one of Glassdoor's 2023 Best Places to Work and honored to be including -- included among Just Capital's Just 100 ranking for 2023. With that, let's now open it up to your questions. Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I would lead with -- we're seeing strength both in terms of customer acquisition, retention, we are seeing strength in our services. As we mentioned a moment ago, both the number of companies that are running payroll, the number of employees that are getting paid is very strong. We're -- if you compare our results to what you're seeing in the marketplace, we are continuing to grow payments 25%, total payments charge volume, which is really outstanding because of the fact that our customers are continuing to benefit from digitizing on our platform. And I think just the additive piece is we're seeing strength in mid-market, which is much higher ARPC and we're quite excited about really being able to pursue non-consumption with what we talked about earlier with QuickBooks Live actually being embedded as part of our overall offering. And I would just end with one of the goals that we talked about with all of you four years ago, our bold 2025 goals. One of those goals was that, we wanted the success rate of small businesses on our platform to be 10 points better than industry. And in fact, the small businesses on our platform, their performance is north of 15 points better than anyone in the industry. And what that just suggests is that, the small businesses on our platform are more successful, they're digitizing and they're leveraging this opportunity to continue to accelerate to deliver for their customers. You're very welcome. Yes, for sure, Siti. Thank you so much for your question. And it's actually a really important question in terms of what we've often talked about, which is, it's important that you all look at Intuit as really the authority when it comes to what's happening in the small business space. And the reason is that, our platform is mission-critical for small businesses. Our platform with QuickBooks, Mailchimp and all the services that we have on our platform, is really used by small businesses to be able to grow customers, manage their customers, manage their cash flow, be able to manage their employees end-to-end. And therefore, what that means is, it fuels our success, supported by the stat I shared a moment ago, where small businesses that are on our platform are actually 15-plus points more successful than those that are not on our platform. And so, I set that very important context, and I'll just point to payments total charge volume as an example. When you look at our performance being at 25%, that is, by far, the best in the industry. And that is because, it is all about digitization. And it's not just about payments, but it's about all the services that our small businesses use on our platform. And we expect our small businesses to continue to be successful, even in this macro environment, and we are here to support them. I will just end by saying the following, which I think you were hinting at this in your question. The strength of our businesses, as Michelle and I described a moment ago, and we expect that strength to continue, although, when you look at our guidance, I think the way you should look at our guidance is that it has been de-risked for sure, for the rest of the year. You are -- we didn't break out the number. But, yes, you're looking at it right, because, in essence, online services, minus, Mailchimp grew faster. So therefore, just by design, it grew much faster than 21%. So you are correct. You're very welcome. Sure, Michael, maybe I will take that. First of all, I'll just start with context. This is a business model shift that we're actually quite excited about in that. One, we've shifted the customers to subscription, so it's far more predictable. Two, in that context, we have had a very planful process of aligning prices between desktop and our online products. And the reason this is really important is we've been heavily investing in the last several years really ensuring that some of the key capabilities for our desktop customers, particularly those product-based businesses, that those capabilities are available in online. And being in the middle of this business model transition, one, we see another 1.5 years of continued strength, but we also see ahead of that, the fact that we can now migrate these customers through our online platform, because we now have the capabilities that they need. And by the way, when we do that \u2013 that actually opens up the doors to additional online services to continue to fuel the success of our small businesses. And therefore, when you step back, ultimately, the growth of this franchise will come from online. And with all of the innovation growth levers we have, moving up-market, that is what continues to give us a lot of confidence in our 15% to 20% long-term expectations for the small business franchise. You're very welcome. Yes. Thanks for your question, Mark. Let me start with context that we always look at our largest growth across the company, no matter what the business is to come from volume and mix. And those two are driven, of course, by our innovation and/or if we are moving up market, which in many cases across our businesses, we are moving upmarket. In TurboTax, the example is moving into the assisted segment. So price and mix are really the largest drivers. And because of just the vast and accelerated innovation, we also have price as a leverage because we always want to be disruptive from the bottom, and we want to continue to disrupt at the top. And that actually gives us a lot of pricing power because of the value equation and the benefits that we deliver for our customers. And so with that as context, looking ahead, not just the next couple of quarters, but looking in terms of just the long-term durability of Intuit and how we think about things, we believe the majority of our growth will continue to come from volume and mix and price will always be a lever because particularly that we are moving upmarket. And I think it was even more pronounced in small business because of the business model shift in desktop, where we are bringing pricing to parity with online and we just -- we expect that to continue in the next several quarters, but that there's a durability element of this, not just a quarterly element for this. Yes, Mark, I would say that when you think about the priorities that we talked about in the focus areas, we are starting to see green shoots, and we started seeing green shoots a couple of quarters ago. And sort of the biggest one is conversion in paid. The one -- in addition to the initiatives starting to deliver green shoots that we are the most excited about is the work that we are doing to retain our high-value customers and to really penetrate in mid-market. This is really the same story that we talked about in mid-market with QuickBooks Advance, where our retention was actually not quite that high when it came to our high-value customers in QuickBooks. And we built a platform and really a team to focus on these mid-market customers. And that is really one that I'm very excited about, and I think we'll see the results of that in the next two to three quarters, where we'll start making a bigger impact in not only retaining our high-value customers, but also penetration in mid-market. And that's also in context of all the other things that we've talked about doing, which is campaign redesign, web redesign, first-time use, one-hour assisted onboarding and now what we just shared earlier in the script, which we said it's coming, and that is the Data Sync. The Data Sync is huge, because now it puts the customer data and purchase data all in one place, and it really puts the power of growth in the hands of customers in a way where they can't get that fuel anywhere else. And so, all these things take time, but we are seeing the green shoots. It will translate into faster revenue growth, sort of, in the coming quarters, which is, by the way, not embedded in our guidance, just to be clear, but we're excited about the progress that we're making. You're very welcome. Yes, Brad, actually, a great question. And the reason it's such an important question is, we are very focused on delivering for our members in the near term and to your point, leading to this macro environment, but we are undeterred relative to the strategic focus areas for the business. And so, let me specifically answer your questions. First of all, let me start with a macro point, which applies to all of Intuit. At Intuit, there are outcomes that we declare that we monitor, but there are also inputs that we focus on. And inputs are key deliverables around product, around go-to-market, around technology investments, and each of our inputs have success measures. And we spend the majority of our time on inputs, because managing inputs and managing where you choose to invest is ultimately the biggest predictor of the outcomes that we want to achieve. So we're very intentional about delivering and managing in the near term for our customers and for you all, and we are undeterred relative to the focus areas that we are focused on in the long term, which are the inputs. With that as sort of uber context in terms of how we run the company, there are several areas that we continue to be focused on, and they're not new, but this is why we believe in the long-term growth of Credit Karma. One is Karma Guarantee. By the way, somebody is typing. So, hopefully, you all can hear me. But Karma Guarantee is a big time differentiator. This is where we use our data and our machine learning capabilities to, in essence, provide certainty that a customer is eligible for a credit card or a personal loan. And now 59% of our members are actually able to get a Karma Guarantee offer, which is a huge deal. We're continuing to invest in that area with our financial institutions and getting financial institutions onto our light box. The second is Credit Karma Money. This is huge, right? This is building out the other side of Credit Karma platform where, in essence, we're helping our members manage money, whether it's paying bills, early access to their money, early access of their refund, building their credit, finding ways to save money. And the more we -- members engage with Credit Karma money, the more their engagement goes up on the platform and the more we can monetize. So that's the second area. And the third area is what we've talked about in the last several quarters, which is our focus on prime customers. This is why we put Mint and Credit Karma together. We're very underpenetrated with our prime members, and we're building out services. And when we launch them, well, of course, you'll be the first to know to really begin to penetrate and monetize prime customers. And last but not least, this is very important. It's better together with TurboTax. It's all the investments that we are making because our goal is we want every Credit Karma member to use TurboTax, and we want every TurboTax customer to put their refund on Credit Karma Money account. So those are the four big areas of focus. Thank you, Brad. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brad. In fact, I'll start with something that we mentioned earlier, but it's really important in the context of your question, and that is our entire campaign strategy and all the investments that we've made in TurboTax Live as a platform has been to bring in prior year assisted customers. And these prior year \u2013 and by the way, our campaign, we'll talk about it in more detail right after tax season. But our campaign is certainly raising heads, and we are seeing more prior year-assisted customers come into the franchise because they see it as a great opportunity to digitally get their taxes done from wherever they are and get the expert help that they need. With that said, the way we think about TurboTax Live is it's really one platform. We are -- we don't look at like full service as just an attach. We look at -- there are those that will come in and choose to get help along the way. And there are those that will come in and digitally exchange all of the documents, had appointment, and have a discussion with our \u2013 expert that's been matched with them and then have us do their taxes for them. And I think we see the type of strength that we would have expected in this area in the \u2013 where we are in the season. With full service, you see more of that strength more towards the latter part of the season. But we're pleased with the halo effect that really it creates because that's what we're really after is to ensure that we communicate and deliver on the promise of, if you want to help with your taxes or you want us to do it for you, we're here for you. And it's the combination of that both campaign strategy and platform delivering on that promise. That is what we look for. With that said, the big change this year is one session virtual engagement where we can get your taxes one and done, and we're seeing success there. And I would also just say we're going to see a lot more sort of in March and April, and that's where this full-service offering will have the largest impact. Yes. Very good question. A couple of things that I'll say. First of all, Steve, as we talked about earlier, we have just had a faster forming season this year, which is great because we're able to not only deliver for our customers, but these are folks that really need their money fast and we've seen a really strong uptake of putting their money on a Credit Karma Money account, which is exactly why we've got the integration between those two platforms. The second thing I would say, and of course, we'll share more tangible results when season is over. But I'm actually quite excited about what we are seeing this year relative to Credit Karma members, in essence, engaging with TurboTax. We spent a lot of sort of our investments in time this past five, six months to remove friction, to remove blockers, to make it much easier if you're a member to pick the right product and then get your taxes done, whether you want to do it yourself or we'll do it for you. So we're seeing good engagement on that front. And I think just last but not least, we're seeing strength with returning customers that use TurboTax Live coming back this year. And again, it's very early in the season. We're actually excited about all the possibilities of acquiring new customers as we look at the rest of the season, particularly because of our campaign. That's raised a lot of heads that we typically wouldn't have raised. So more to come when season is over. And by the way, we're iterating real-time, making product improvements real-time, launching new features every seven days. So we're excited about the game that's ahead of us and where we are as we sit today. Yes, yes, absolutely. It's a very, very good question because if you just do the math, what we've delivered the first half of the year and you look at where we're going to deliver the second half of the year, it would suggest significant deceleration. So thank you for asking the question. I would say everything that we talked about across all the businesses stands. We're confident in our guidance and we're confident in what we're seeing in the businesses and where each business sits. I think the reality is, generally, we have a principle, we don't touch our guidance while we're heading into our third quarter. Our third quarter is double the revenue of any other quarter. And so, we'd like to get to the third quarter and then talk to you all about what our guidance is moving forward. So really, the way you should think about our guidance is it's derisked. Yes, absolutely. Yes. Thank you for the question, Kash. And I just have to start by saying, we've got a lot of octane in the tank left across all of our Big Bets. I love all of my five children. But I'll answer your question around payments. I think there are three things. And let me -- 30 seconds of context, and I'll specifically answer your question, because we talked about payments and money movement a lot. One huge element of what happens on our platform is, small businesses come in, they create an estimate, they invoice and then they need to get paid for that invoice once they do the work. And our penetration in that -- we talk often about we have $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. Our penetration there is still low. And so, it's just important to start there and not move off of that, because that's a huge growth opportunity. It's a huge area of investment. And by the way, why in this macro environment where everybody's payments volumes are not accelerating or they're significantly decelerating, we still have 25% total charge volume growth. So that's number one. There's a lot of octane left there, and we are significantly focused. I think the other one that we've traditionally not focused on at all, is this entire B2B network, which is digitizing business to business between our small businesses. We now have the capabilities. We launched the business network last quarter to millions of our QuickBooks customers. That is a big opportunity, of course, very low -- no penetration, because we didn't have it before, and it's 70% checks. So that's a big one. And then part of that is also just bill pay capabilities, which we've had on our platform through a couple of really strong partners. And now we're building that capability ourselves, because we believe that it can deliver a far seamless experience for our customers. And then, when you take all of that and go to mid-market, it's even a bigger opportunity, which is why we're seeing the strength in our mid-market growth, because of just the size of payments and payroll that takes place. So, hopefully, that answers your question Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you, Kash. Yeah, Scott. I love the question, because this is actually important for everybody to hear since you see the IRS reports on a weekly basis. It's almost \u2013 if I were to tell you all, it's almost hard for you all to pay attention to these reports because so much has changed and will continue to change. So let me start with context. Before COVID, before 2020, things were generally predictable, but things were continuing year in and year out to get pushed out to April. What do I mean by predictable. Generally, you would see a strong first peak, which went through mid-February and it would start end of January, and then you would sort of have very low volume and then you would have a lot of volume come in on the 14th and 15th of April. And what was happening every year, that curve was predictable \u2013 about what's happening is every year, more and more people pushed out to do their taxes on the 14 and 15 because there were solutions like ours where they could wait until last minute to do it. So that was pre-COVID. When COVID hit, when everybody sort of was locked up in their homes, when tax season got extended two years in a row, and now the fact that folks are actually working virtually, it completely blew up the curve and the habits of customers. And so what we are now seeing this season is initially, we saw a fast forming season similar to what would happen pre-COVID. A lot of people came in because they needed money. And what we're seeing now is \u2013 what we've been seeing, which is a lot of people are pushing out to complete their taxes sort of last minute. But what's very difficult, I know for you all to compare, we have a lot of internal data so we can assess what's happening is that it's hard to compare year-over-year, because there's so much that changed in the last several years. And again, what we're seeing this year is now people are at work, but remember, they're still generally working in a hybrid environment. So even days of the week, times of the day when their taxes is not comparable to last year. But generally speaking, fast forming and then a bunch of people are going to do their taxes in the last several days of April before taxes are due is the way you should think about it. Yes, yes, sure. First of all, let me start with my comments where the guidance for the company is derisked. That includes Credit Karma. So my comments weren't just about Credit Karma, it was really about the whole company because if you just do the math, it seems that we are significantly decelerating the second half of the year versus the first half of the year and that's the point I made, which is principally, we don't touch guidance until we get to our largest quarter, which is this quarter. And so therefore, the way to think about our guidance is that it's derisked. That includes Credit Karma. The second thing is, if you recall, when Michelle and I talked about when we reset the Credit Karma guidance to minus 15% to minus 10%, what we talked about is, one, we feel the new guidance was very prudent. We also really built in some deterioration in the second half of the year and we didn't count on our innovation having the kind of impact we initially had assumed in our first guidance. And I think that still stands. With that said, I actually feel very good about where we are. I would say we are where we want it to be because we have very high goals with Karma Guarantee. 59% of our members now having at least one Karma Guarantee offer is really a big deal. So I feel good in terms of the progress we're making on that front, the front of Credit Karma Money with the integration with TurboTax. Those are all -- our input goals in those areas are on track, and it will be fun to watch how they play out the rest of the year, but we're not relying on that to achieve our guidance. Yes, very welcome. Yes, Brent, two over points. The first one is you're always going to see toggling between online accounting growth rate and online services growth rate. What you really should pay attention to is the overall growth rate. With that said, to answer your question, we actually saw strength across the board. Mailchimp, our growth is what brought down the online services growth to 21% because it is growing slower then, of course, it's growing low teens, but it was really driven down by Mailchimp. And Mailchimp is growing low teens, similar to last quarter, but that was really the primary reason a little bit very small amount by payments now growing at 25%, but really, it's Mailchimp. No. It's really -- we have very clear priorities put great leaders in the business. I was actually just in Atlanta about three weeks ago, spent more than a day with the entire team, and it's just really execution. And I feel very good about the focus areas, the progress on our execution, it is in our control, which is sort of a great place to be in. It's not macro, it's us. Yes. Good question, Alex. Let me start with small business. And given that we have 10 million-plus small businesses on our platform and by the way, with the way they're digitizing it's probably best to just talk specifically about the data that we are seeing. If you go back to last quarter, what I had mentioned is, small businesses generally still have strong cash reserves. They're using some of those cash reserves to continue to invest in their business. And they're still hiring. They're still having a little bit of a hard time hiring, but they are still hiring. They couldn't find talent. But then there are sectors like financial services, real estate, auto that were down nearly 15% in revenue year-over-year. If I forwarded to the data that we're seeing now, this quarter, two things. One, they're continuing to hire, and they're actually finding it easier to hire. And those same industries that I just mentioned, real estate, financial services and auto have actually kicked off in performance. Their performance is better. Like, for instance, I think real estate and financial services are -- they were down like 15% plus, and now they're down less than 10% as an example. And auto, believe it or not, was down minus 2% versus the minus sort of 10% to 15%, it was down. So we're actually seeing an uptick and improved performance in our base in those areas that were actually hit the hardest. So that's sort of the macro environment that I would say. And I would actually reiterate what Michelle and I talked about earlier, which is, our focus and innovation on payments is working, because although consumer spending has moderated a bit, our total charge volume is growing 25%, which is quite healthy and significant. So that's what we're seeing on the small business side. On the Consumer side, two things I would say. And remember, we have nearly 100 million consumers on our platform. So this is really indicative of the world outside of our platform. Since March of last year, credit scores are down about 13 points and credit card balances are up a little bit over 20%. Those that are hit the hardest are those that are in the credit band of 600 to 660, where their average balance on their credit card is like $9,000. So that's the -- a little bit of the state of the world on the consumer side. Hopefully, that answers your question, Alex. Alex, I'm glad you got it in. I'm surprised it took till the top of the hour for somebody to ask, so thank you for asking. It's actually a really important question. And I want to take you all back to \u2013 AI is core to our strategy. And now that everybody is talking about AI, I'm actually delighted because hopefully, it will expose to all of you why four years ago, when we refreshed our strategy, it was about being an AI-driven expert platform. And the investments that we've made in data and AI is really what's fueled a lot of our innovation across the company. And as you heard us talk about at Investor Day, it's why we put Marion in front of you all, we're just at the beginning of the curve as to what's possible. So first and foremost, the investments around data and AI is, what's fueling our success. And we've been looking at generative AI. In fact, there are multiple areas across our platform, where we've launch some of the capabilities of generative AI because it's all about reducing work and finding ways to put more money in your pocket with confidence, and it actually helps our experts. The key areas that we are focused on working with a couple of companies in this area is accuracy. And it will become more accurate over time, but we deal with people's money. And that matters in terms of the advice that we give. For us, this is all an accelerant, which, by the way, we've been working on for many, many, many months before this became sort of the buzz. But AI is core to our strategy. So we're delighted with the possibilities of the future. You're very welcome. Yes. Well, listen, thank you, everybody, for your time. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Once again, I want to thank Michelle for 20 years at Intuit. She'll be back with us, by the way. She's with us through August, and delighted with Sandeep joining us as our new CFO in August. But with that said, we'll talk to you at next earnings until then, be safe, be good. Talk soon. Bye, everybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Regina. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong first quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to feel bullish about our momentum and execution across small business and tax. We're innovating at a high velocity using the power of our platform and modern technology capabilities to deliver new offerings at scale focusing on breakthrough adoption. We continue to be focused on putting more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. This is more important than ever in the current uncertain economic environment and helps us penetrate our large total addressable market of over $300 billion. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Revenue grew 29%, including 13 points from the addition of Mailchimp. Total revenue growth was fueled by the Small Business & Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 38% or 19% excluding Mailchimp and 25% revenue growth in the Consumer Group driven by a strong October peak with new customers and extension filers. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see charge volume growth, the number of employees paid, the hours worked per small business and cash reserves. These measures remain strong for those on our platform and inform our perspective on the health of small businesses. TurboTax had a robust finish to the tax season with a record number of innovations launched and tested in the October peak. I'm excited about this upcoming season, particularly our strategy to transform the assisted category, including the launch of Business Tax and TurboTax and Credit Karma platform integrations. Now turning to Credit Karma. At Investor Day and on our fourth quarter call earnings call, we shared that all Credit Karma verticals had been negatively impacted by the macro uncertainty. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into November, we saw further deterioration in all verticals. Consumer default rates remain relatively low by historical standards, reflecting strong consumer cash balances coming out of the pandemic. However, we continue to see partners pull back from extending credit, reflecting the uncertainty in the economic environment and the risk of deterioration in credit performance. Given this context, Credit Karma revenue came in lower than expected for the quarter. We are lowering our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for Credit Karma to a decline of 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 10% to 15% growth. At the same time, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for all other segments and reiterating our fiscal 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance. Our ability to maintain earnings power despite the lower Credit Karma revenue guidance shows the power of our diversified platform and our ability to balance platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our commitments. Regardless of the near-term macro volatility, we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% for Credit Karma driven by our vision and innovation to become the self-driving financial platform fueling prosperity for all consumers. At Investor Day, we shared how our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating our innovation and how our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate our success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across three of these Big Bets. Our first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our Big Bets. Our evolution from a siloed technology stack to a platform leveraging shared capabilities is well underway. Our development environment enables speed and innovation. Engineers now have 6x the velocity of deploying code, resulting in accelerated innovation compared to fiscal year 2020. Our AI and fintech capabilities are well positioned to solve our customers' biggest problems, such as our money innovations across payments and payroll, advancements in TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advance, just to name a few. And we're doing that today with over 730 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, 2 million AI models in production, 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and over $465 billion in money moved during fiscal year 2022. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customer face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. During the October tax peak, our team launched a record 50 innovations to test and learn. Our learnings can help us transform our go-to-market campaign for the assisted segment; revamp the end-to-end TurboTax Live platform experiences with faster access to money via Credit Karma; and better serve the investor, Latino and self-employed segments. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. With Mailchimp, we're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we launched a new brand campaign, refreshed our website and launched an improved first-time use experience for new customers that help them more quickly find and use the feature that aligns with their unique business needs. We also launched a one-hour assisted onboarding process for our high-value Mailchimp customers with the goal of guiding them to more advanced features to increase awareness and usage. This program was launched in a record four weeks by leveraging components of our virtual expert platform, another example of the power of the Intuit platform capabilities. As a result of these enhancements and others, we're seeing a positive impact on customer growth and expansion and a lift in customers converting to pay. Turning to our money portfolio. We've made a tremendous investment over the last few years to expand our suite of money offerings to help small businesses get paid, pay others and access capital and manage their money. We continue to see strength in our charge volume driven by easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront. This quarter, we made it even easier for more customers to access their cash quickly by removing friction and opening the funnel to more customers. We're also rolling out a new invoicing experience with a more streamlined workflow and improved design, which is driving an increase in the percentage of companies that send payment-enabled invoices. Looking ahead, we're tackling another big challenge for our small business customers, B2B payments. More than $2 trillion of invoices were managed in QuickBooks in fiscal year 2022. As we shared at Investor Day, we are launching the QuickBooks Business Network, which connects small business customers each other, making it easier for them to do business. It's currently in beta testing, and we expect to launch more broadly later this fiscal year. We're also building our own bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. We're excited about our opportunities for growth with Mailchimp and payments becoming the center of small business growth. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy and the power of our platform. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever for our customers. We have a large TAM with low penetration, secular shifts working in our favor, a diversified large-scale platform where we continue to invest heavily in innovation across our 5 Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers, resulting in top line growth and margin expansion. We're proud to be an employer of choice as well as the financial technology platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $76 million versus $195 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $662 million versus $555 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 versus $0.82 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.53 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 38% during the quarter and 19% on an organic basis, excluding $264 million in Mailchimp revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 60% in Q1 or 28% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business & Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 29% in Q1 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 109% in Q1. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 28%. Mailchimp revenue included in online services was $264 million, up low teens versus a year ago, in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, and we began to execute our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 172% in Q1 and 19% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. As a reminder, the subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with QBO pricing. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits during the quarter. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 2% to $425 million in Q1. This was below our expectations of mid-single-digit growth we shared at Investor Day due to further deterioration in all verticals the last few weeks of the quarter. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards, offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans. As the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, we're seeing an impact across all verticals. Sasan touched on this briefly earlier, but let me unpack what we're seeing. In credit cards, many financial institution partners have tightened eligibility, particularly in riskier segments. In personal loans, we saw continued pressure with many partners tightening eligibility further while increasing APRs. We continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. As a result, we are reducing our fiscal 2023 Credit Karma revenue guidance to a decline of 15% to 10%. This embeds the current trends we're seeing and additional conservatism in the remainder of the year despite the expected continued rollout of several new innovations. Consumer Group revenue was $150 million, reflecting a strong finish to the tax season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted category in the tax prep market as we head into the next tax season. We're focused on making TurboTax a compelling destination for filers who prefer assistance to complete their taxes accurately and quickly. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue of $34 million was in line with our expectations. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $7 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable January 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared last quarter, we have an operating system we use to run the Company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. As Sasan shared earlier, we are reiterating our operating income and earnings per share expectations for fiscal year 2023 despite our lower revenue expectations for Credit Karma. We're able to do this by reducing spend in areas where we expect to see lower returns near term. Last quarter, I mentioned we identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios, and the adjustments we have made are an example. Given the breadth of our offerings and the power of our diversified platform, we have the ability to maintain earnings power despite our expectation for lower Credit Karma revenue. At the same time, we have the ability to make the necessary platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our short- and long-term commitments. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our revenue guidance for Credit Karma as trends in all verticals further deteriorated in the last few weeks of the quarter and into November. We now expect revenue to decline 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance range of 10% to 15% revenue growth. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for all other segments and now expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12% versus the previous range of 14% to 16%. For the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, we continue to expect 19% to 20% revenue growth. And for the Consumer Group, we continue to expect 9% to 10% revenue growth. In both businesses, we expect the majority of our growth this year to come from customer growth and mix. We are reiterating our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. This demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified platform and business model. So to recap, for fiscal year 2023, we expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP loss per share of $0.29 to $0.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.45. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. As you all heard from Michelle and I, we're seeing continued momentum as a result of our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform, growing Intuit double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. And with that, let me turn it over to your questions.\nOperator: Our first question will come from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: Sasan, you lowered your Credit Karma growth now from 10% to 15% growth to decline now 15% to 10%. Just want to dig a little bit into your assumption for the remaining quarters in this fiscal year. Where do you see -- how conservative is this guidance? And I know that the Karma guarantee will be rolled out sometime later this year. Where can we see some kind of upside surprise if macro stays at the current level?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thanks for your question, Siti. So a couple of things. One, as you heard from Michelle, we took the current sort of trends that we were seeing in sort of end of October into November into account. But we also very intentionally included further conservatism, deterioration just to be prudent. And so when we look at things around delinquency rates and unemployment, which is really what financial institutions look at to make future decisions, although they are at historical lows, the assumption is that they're going to deteriorate. And so we just assumed that they will significantly deteriorate, and we wanted to include that in our go-forward guidance. We take a lot of pride in the commitments that we make at the Company level, and we want to make sure that we're very prudent in terms of the assumptions that we made with the guidance going forward. With that said, I think what I would amplify is our innovation that we talked about at Investor Day. Beyond things like Karma Guarantee, we are actually -- we have launched, it's almost at full scale, something called the Marketplace, where we're giving more exposure to personalize experiences around cards and personal loans to our members. And now with the integration of Mint and Credit Karma, which was part of our refreshed Big Bet three vision that we talked about at Investor Day, we expect in the future to have additional sort of capabilities and innovations for our prime customers, which has not been our sweet spot in -- on the Credit Karma platform. So we are leaning into our innovation and those possibilities. We are not counting on any of that impacting the growth rate that you just heard from Michelle and I for the fiscal year, and we just simply believe that's the right thing to do.\nSiti Panigrahi: Great. And then a quick follow-up on the small business side. That's pretty impressive quarter, and it grew 19% organically. And if I look at your guidance for remaining three quarters, you just have to grow 14% to hit your guidance. You already -- like you talked about price mix shift and -- or you already raised pricing 10% to 25%. So what are you seeing in the small business side? And what are your assumptions for the remaining of the year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Absolutely. First of all, I would start by saying we have a lot of visibility into things around consumer spending, which is charge volume. We see the number of employees, whether they're going up and down. We see a number of hours worked. We see cash reserves. And of course, there's our metrics around acquisition, retention, payments and payroll volume and also what we see across Mailchimp. And what we're seeing across the board is a continued flight to digitization. If you use our payments capability, you get paid faster, and cash flow is more critical in this environment. If you use our payroll capabilities, you're actually able to reduce errors and pay your employees and have money moved from your bank account to their bank account same day versus two weeks in advance. With the use of innovation that you've heard from us on Mailchimp, we're actually starting to see customer growth tick up. And so those are just illustrative examples are -- we're just continuing to see based on our innovation a flight to digitization, which is the strength that you heard from us in the first quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue the rest of the year. And we remain steadfast on our guidance until we see more quarters, but it is not at all about our sentiment about small business. We actually feel very good about what we're seeing across the board in small business.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrad Sills: Just a question on the reiterated operating income guide. You lowered top line by, it looks like, about $700 million, yet you're able to sustain your operating income guidance, which is impressive and it speaks to the flexibility in your model. Michelle, you alluded to some adjustments that were made, if you could just provide a little bit of color as to where those adjustments were made in the business?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes. Brad...\nSasan Goodarzi: Sorry, Michelle, go ahead. I was going to ask who the question was for. But Michelle, please go ahead.\nMichelle Clatterbuck: No worries. No worries. Thank you, Brad. Yes, it is one of the things that we feel very good about. As I talked about on a previous call, when we were going through our planning for this year, we were really looking at making sure we had identified areas that we could take action on, the levers we could pull if we did see the macro environment get worse. Those things look like marketing expenses, things that we just don't think are going to pay off in the near term; other areas like travel, discretionary spend. But we are protecting R&D and our innovation. And we are continuing to invest. Our investments and our head count continue to go up across the Company. And yes, Credit Karma, we have taken the revenue down with a revenue hit there. But when we look at really being able to manage our expenses, it is looking across the Company holistically and really focusing on the areas where we think we're not going to see as much return in the short term so that we can continue to focus longer term and drive the innovation.\nBrad Sills: Excellent. And this -- Sasan, one for you, if I may, please. Last year, we saw a little bit of moderation in TurboTax ASP growth. You talked a little bit about that at the Analyst Day. I think it was 4% on paid ARPU versus, I think, 8% in prior years. If you could elaborate a bit on what went on there. And should we see some acceleration here? Now that you're getting into more experience with TT Live and full service, might we actually see some acceleration in TurboTax ARPU?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Absolutely. I think the way to think about it is in the long term and from a trajectory perspective, we should see ARPU go up. And now every year, strategically, we make decisions in terms of where we may expand our free offering or where we may increase price based on the leverage that we see in the marketplace, which is primarily in our assisted offerings. And those were some of the adjustments that we made last year. And as we look into this year, we actually feel very good about our do-it-yourself platform lineup. And really, our biggest leverage is going to come from accelerating what we're seeing across the TurboTax Live platform, which is really where the growth is coming from. It's really where the ARPU comes from, and it's where our biggest opportunity is with a $20 billion TAM in front of us. And of course, overtime, opening up an additional $10 billion TAM with business taxes. So that was really the intent and the logic behind why ARPU was probably a little bit slower growth last year versus prior years. And I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to see ARPU growth into the future, and a lot of it will come from the assisted segment. And that's really part of our plan that we're executing against this coming year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Can you guys hear me?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Perfect.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Sasan, you guys are always very transparent, great disclosure. And my question is maybe a little bit bigger picture. Can you talk about the opportunity to open up and externalize into its platform services to third parties for developing their own apps with live expert functionality, rich data services, money movement perhaps, and the things that are making you so successful?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Absolutely. Great question. This was actually at Investor Day one of our, what we call Horizon 3 ideas that we have invested in, which is around externalizing services. So first and foremost, we do see a big problem space out there where developers and partners and firms look to access and have a need for things like around our virtual expert platform services to connect people to experts or had to use for our identity services and have a use for our fraud and risk capabilities. So there's a lot of services that we have across our platform that you heard Mariana talk about of which there is a need for those services externally. Now we want to be very choiceful and intentional what we choose to externalize and what we choose not to externalize and what problems we choose to solve and which ones we intentionally choose not to solve. But we do believe it as an opportunity, it's actually something that we funded about a little bit over 15 months ago, and we have a mission-based team that is working on it. And when we have more to share in terms of launches and anything that we think over time will be material for all of you to be aware, we'll be the first to share with you. But we do see it as an exciting Horizon 3 idea that's been funded and are excited about the prospects of it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: I wanted to ask on Mailchimp. So last quarter, you pointed out that you were kind of working on go-to-market a little bit. You wanted to adjust that. This sound -- this quarter, you sounded better, and it looks like you're using Mailchimp like the lead to go -- to attack the international markets more broadly. Can you speak a little bit about what you do there, the progress that you're making, where you are in that journey, please?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Absolutely. First of all, I'll just state that I'm really excited about Rania that we just put into the business and the leadership team that she is building in. It is the result of that leadership team where we are seeing accelerated innovation. And as I mentioned a moment ago, there's been a lot of innovation just in the last sort of three to four months in Mailchimp from an entirely new brand campaign where we communicate the benefit to how you can grow your business to SMBs, both on air and on -- through digital assets. We've redesigned our website. So when you come to us, you're very clear about the benefits that we offer, the choices that you have and why it can help fuel the success of your business to then revamping the first-time use experience, along with what we have just implemented for, I would say, higher-value, larger Mailchimp customers and new customers that we want to pursue, which is a one-hour assisted onboarding to help you get on to the platform to help you understand the benefits of the platform. And in context of what we've shared around international and Mailchimp as sort of the lead internationally, we are right now focused on localizing the language. Where we have localized language versus not, we have more than 13 points conversion variants. And so of course, localized language is one of our largest levers internationally along with having a playbook that we're putting in place around go-to-market to raise awareness. So a lot of those things we have already launched that I mentioned and the localizing languages we're working on as we speak. And a lot of what we -- what I just shared, we're starting to see a real impact from customer uptick, expansion revenue. And we're excited about the possibilities and the momentum that the leadership team is building.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Congrats on a good quarter. Sasan, you all are in a somewhat unique position that you get to see demand -- sort of demand on both the front-office side as well as sort of the back-office side of Mailchimp and then QuickBooks. I was wondering if you could give us any when you look at the demand indicators from a front-office perspective or a back-office perspective. Are they similar? Are they different? Is there anything you've noticed now that you got to have some insight into sort of that other part of the -- of essentially the operating ecosystem of your customers? Obviously, there's just a lot of discussion in the market right now between front-office and back-office demand. So I was wondering if you can enlighten us, I guess, with any of your thoughts on that.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Kirk. And let me try to be descriptive about it, so I'm not overly generic. I think our customers that we serve, the small businesses between zero to 100 employees don't as much think about back office, front office. They just really look to have a platform to be able to grow their business and to be able to manage their cash flow. So if you think about our QuickBooks platform, let me start there, and I'll get to a jump in a moment. Really, QuickBooks helps you manage your cash flow, all your money coming in and money going out. And the notion of digitization is really important for customers, which is why we're enjoying the growth that we just shared. And that really comes down to customers can use QuickBooks to be organized. They can get paid much faster with using our payments capabilities. They can get access to capital. They can have instant money flow from their bank to their employees' banks by using our payroll. If they're out in the field, they can use our time tracking so everything is automated. All those things are about digitization. And the way small businesses think about it is it actually helps them with their cash flow because we also -- with all those capabilities, project your cash flow. So that's the real big value sort of QuickBooks. And then you add to that Mailchimp. The real value of Mailchimp is don't think about it as these are not enterprise customers. These are smaller, small businesses that where their sort of lifeline comes from being able to reach out and manage their existing customers but also effectively be able to grow their customer base. And so the reason we're continuing to see an uptick based on our innovation and based on just good execution. And I think the best is yet ahead of us in Mailchimp is that is separate and distinct from do I spend more money on advertising dollars. When you use Mailchimp, you have the ability to use our tools with a subscription that you pay on a monthly basis to be able to in an automated way, reach out to your customers, market to new customers. And we're seeing sort of equal demand -- if I go back to your frame of front office versus back office, I think where there is slower spend and declining is spending money on advertising dollars. That is not what -- Mailchimp is not impacted by advertising dollars. It's actually a -- it's a platform that you use to be able to manage your customers even if you choose to spend less advertising dollars. You can still use Mailchimp very effectively to be able to manage your customers. So that's why the demand is strong with Mailchimp and QuickBooks, and that's really what we see across the platform.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Next quarter in Q1. The question that we're all going to get tomorrow from investors is the outlook derisked. So I wanted to dig into kind of like your guys thought process. When you're talking about Credit Karma, you told us that -- you looked at sort of the trends that happened in -- at the end of the quarter in the last couple of weeks, and you assume that those trends deteriorate a little bit further on a go-forward basis to get a conservative Credit Karma guide. Can you talk to us about -- like you didn't change any of the other numbers? All the other sort of business lines are kind of intact with your prior expectations. But is there any similar kind of derisking them? Like are you assuming any degradation in the underlying business for QBO or Mailchimp or like any of the other businesses in a similar way you are Credit Karma?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And I just want to acknowledge that you and others were pushing us on our Credit Karma side at Investor Day. And let me just start at the top level to share sort of what we've learned and what we've adjusted, and then I'll answer your question. When we look across tax, which is 35% of the Company; and then when you look at across small business, which is over 50% of the Company, so that's like 86% of the Company, we have sort of -- which includes Mailchimp, we have proven and tried KPIs that allows us to see things well into sort of the future not only to ensure that we're investing in all the right things, but also be able to be very intentional and thoughtful about how we guide because we take our guidance very seriously. One of the things that we learned with Credit Karma is there are two factors that we look at but we did not take into account: one is unemployment, the other is delinquency rates. And what I mean by that, not taking it into account as we view it, we look at it, and they're at historical lows. And the one thing that we learned from this process, what we are adjusting and have adjusted our KPIs is just looking at where they are today, but also projecting where they could be a year from now and ultimately projecting what could happen if we were sitting in the shoes of some of the partners that are on our platform. So that is a very important shift, which actually gets at the point you made around our Credit Karma guidance. We feel that it is absolutely derisked. We -- as you heard from Michelle and I, we have built a deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year because we have taken into account uptick in both unemployment and delinquency rates, and therefore, have put out a guidance that we believe is the risk. To go to the second part of your question, tax, which is 35% of the Company, that is really economically resilient. So let me focus my answer on Small Business. Because of our KPIs and the rich data that we have access to and what we see within Small Business, we actually feel like our guidance in Small Business is derisked because we make certain assumptions around how things will potentially play out the remainder of the year that we took into account when we set the initial guidance, and we still feel very good about the guidance. And you can see based on what we delivered in Q1, we can just do the math and see what it means for the rest of the year. So we feel very good about the way we set guidance in those two businesses. We feel very good about the guidance in those areas for the rest of the year. And hopefully, my explanation made sense around Credit Karma.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Yes, that's super helpful. And then just one clarification question. On Mailchimp, it looks like the revenues was basically flat, maybe down a little bit sequentially. I'm assuming there is a currency impact in there. Can you -- is there like a constant currency number that we could see kind of like how it sequentially?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. It's actually -- it is in constant currency. I mean maybe, Michele, I'll let you chime in here in a moment. But I think what I would say is we -- when you look at our innovation and when you look at our customer uptick and the expansion revenue that we're starting to see, it's actually very much in line with what we would have expected because a lot of our innovation that is in place is actually now accelerating the growth of the business. Because remember, this business was run for cash flow and profitability, and now we're running it for growth. And we're actually quite pleased with the impact that we're starting to see, and we would expect that to accelerate in the upcoming quarters. But Michelle, do you want to chime in on the currency version?\nMichelle Clatterbuck: Yes. The only thing I would clarify is that Mailchimp actually sold at U.S. dollars, and so there isn't a currency impact there for the international, even though 50% of their sales are outside the U.S.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Congrats on the results. Sasan and Michelle, curious to get your perspective, we don't like recessions, but this is a recession, maybe it's a recession that we've all been anticipating. It's most widely anticipated one. So what are the assumptions that you have incorporated in your soon you're forecasting for the foreseeable future? I mean, is it an uptick in attrition or maybe the expansion rates come down a little bit? I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what you've dialed in with your current go around of trajections. And also, Sasan, if you could talk about payments. You clearly demoed at the analyst event, very, very impressive. Clearly, it's got a lot of potential. What should we be expecting? What are you expecting in your payments business in the medium term to long term? What are your goals? Congrats.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kash. Just in terms of your question around assumptions, I think on Credit Karma, hopefully, what I just shared a moment ago resonated in that. We are assuming sort of further deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year or the remainder of the year, I should say. Despite a lot of innovation that is still coming to market because we're just -- we're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates getting worse, which means that financial institutions, although we're one of the last platforms they pull off of that they will be conservative in terms of their investment levels. So those are the assumptions that we've made for the remainder of the fiscal year for Credit Karma. And for Small Business, a lot of the strength that we're continuing to see is just -- it's a shift to digitization from folks that are already on our platform. So we have a lot of customers that are on our platform. If you remember, we used the figure of -- there's $2 trillion of invoices being managed on our platform, and we have over $100 million that is part of our -- well over $100 million as part of our payments charge volume, which means we have a huge opportunity to penetrate that within our existing base. And I use that just as an illustrative example, Kash. To answer your question, we're not making any assumptions around payments uptick because the macro environment will get better in the second half of the year. We're actually assuming that a lot of the growth that we are seeing is just continuing shift to digitization from those that are on our platform. And so we make customer acquisition assumptions. We make attrition assumptions. We'll look at assumptions around payments and payroll that are really in context of how we feel about the environment going forward. Although we're not seeing it within our SMB segment, we are assuming a level of conservatism as we think about the remainder of the year. And those are the assumptions that we've made for both Small Business and Credit Karma. And tax, again, tax is economically resilient. We pretty much make assumptions based on our penetration in the assisted segment. And that's really -- that and the total number of IRS returns is where our assumptions come from. And again, those are -- that's economically resilient. So that's how we think about the guide going forward as we just reiterated. In terms of payments, listen, payments is one of the areas that we're the most excited about. If I had to pick a couple of areas, it's Mailchimp, it's payments and it's what we're doing to go upmarket and with QuickBooks Advanced and mid-market. And with payments, we spent four or five years building out all of our fraud and risk capabilities, all of our AI capabilities, and we're just innovating very fast with that team. And a lot of the future around what we can do to digitize B2B around what's possible with bill pay, that -- those are yet to come and not even in our forecast going forward because we just believe that there's so much room for penetration attached going forward. So hopefully, our say and payments has been to your liking, but we think our best is yet ahead of us.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Sasan, I'm curious, I'm kind of honing in on Credit Karma and credit cards, which I believe is about half of the revenue. And please correct me if that's changed, perhaps gone up, based on what personal loans has done. But just how are you looking at credit cards? What are you seeing with consumers there? I understand it was the strength in that segment of the quarter versus personal loans, home loans, auto loans, auto insurance. What -- specifically in the credit cards, is that strengthening -- or maybe not strengthening, but weakening a lot less? Just honing in on that specific segment, what are you seeing from the consumer?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Scott. First of all, it is -- as you said, it's a large part of the overall Credit Karma platform. With that said, I'll start with context that when you look at the 129 million customers or members that we serve on Credit Karma, the majority of our focus has been sub-prime and near-prime customers. And that's really a lot of our personalized experiences are for those cohorts. And one of the things that we're very excited about that we have shared at Investor Day is we're also building out capabilities and innovation for prime customers. And that's why we shifted Mint over, and we're combining the Mint and Credit Karma platform. So that context is important because as you hear my answer, just hear it from the lens of the majority of where our business comes from is sub-prime and near-prime. In the future, we'll also have capabilities, innovation and ultimately, revenue that will come up front and prime as well, which positions us really well in the marketplace. And with all of that said, in essence, yes, we're continuing to see growth in credit cards, but we're actually assuming that, that will really deteriorate the rest of the year based on unemployment going up and delinquency rates going up. And as you heard from both Michelle and I, we have built conservatism into the remainder of the year. And so there's -- which will ultimately result in declining growth rate. But what we saw in Q1 and the growth rate of the 2%, a lot of the headwinds in other verticals was offset by credit cards. But we have assumed that, that will get worse over time.\nScott Schneeberger: Okay. Appreciate that. And then following on -- it's kind of more on the tax side, but overall, the guidance for the second quarter seems to be the most derisked with EPS down year-over-year. And that's an uncommon sequential change. But it sounds like the levers Michelle is pulling, it sounded like marketing and advertising was one of them. I infer that it's more in the small business side. But just curious on the tax side, are you doing anything differently now that we may have a more normal tax season versus the past few with regard to advertising timing or overall?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. I'm actually glad you asked about our second quarter guide of 8% to 9%. First of all, our momentum in Small Business continues into Q2. There are two elements that drive our guide of 8% to 9% revenue growth in second quarter. One is we always make assumptions for tax. As you know, tax is tricky between second quarter and third quarter. And we make assumptions around when the IRS will open, forms availability, and those assumptions drive what we assume will happen in our tax business. And in some cases, we have elements of our tax business that actually we've assumed may decline in the second quarter. So that drives our guidance overall at the Company level for Q2. And then Q2 generally has been seasonally the weakest quarter for Credit Karma because of the month of November, December and January and then just the number of holidays. It's seasonally the weakest quarter. So when you combine our assumptions with tax and you combine our assumptions with Credit Karma, that's where you get Q2 where it is. And hopefully, that answers your question.\nScott Schneeberger: It does.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAllan Verkhovski: This is Allan Verkhovski on for Alex Zukin. I think more people are warming up to your ability in hitting your SMB guide for the year despite the challenging macro. But I want to dig further into what you're seeing in the SMB segment today. Can you talk about what you saw around ARPC growth in the quarter, excluding the benefit you observed from the pricing increases that went into effect? It'd be helpful to get how much of a tailwind the pricing increase was in the quarter for QBO accounting and better understand the quarter how your growth levers, such as customer growth, upselling and cross-selling, were impacted from the macro, if at all?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Absolutely. The majority of our guide for the year and what we also saw in Q1 actually came from customer growth and mix, and mix includes things like QuickBooks Advanced. And you saw from our online services growth of 28%, we're seeing really sort of good growth from Payroll, Payments, Time Tracking. And that, of course, excludes Mailchimp, and we talk about Mailchimp separately. So I think the short answer to your question is we are seeing the type of balance that we would want, which is our growth coming from customer growth and mix and price will play an element -- a smaller element, but it plays an important element as we look at not only what we saw in Q1, but what we expect for the remainder of the year.\nAllan Verkhovski: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, if I may. On the Mailchimp front, I want to follow up to Keith's earlier point around Mailchimp revenues being sequentially relatively flat. Could you share maybe something more about maybe conversion rates? Or just a follow-up on the acceleration comment you made through the full year, just anything that could give us more color for how we think about potential revenue growth of Mailchimp for the full year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. I mean if you go back to when we closed the deal almost a year ago, one of the things that we were very clear about, in addition to our excitement around the asset and the fact that now combined with QuickBooks, we can have one growth platform that can be the source of truth for -- and the source of growth for a small business, one of the things that we reiterated was that this was really a business that was run for profitability and it was run for cash flow. And even particularly in COVID times, where you saw a lot of front-office company accelerates, Mailchimp really didn't because, again, it was more run for cash flow and profitability. And so we worked very hard in the last year to put a playbook in place in context of the priorities that we've shared to accelerate growth. And those priorities, they always take time to shift the business from being run for profitability and cash flow to be run for a growth business typically takes a couple of years. And we're actually starting to see a trajectory change within the first year. And we're quite demanding of ourselves in terms of the velocity that we would like to see. So really, what's happened there last year is we were taking a business that was, again, run for profitability, cash flow to revamping the website coming up with a new campaign, revamping the product. And when I say revamp, it's not done. We've not reached the destination. It's just the beginning of what's possible to really focus on high-value customers to position ourselves to go after mid-market to start ramping up what we can do internationally. All of these things, we're starting to now see indicators where in the quarter, although it was sequentially flat from a revenue perspective, we're seeing conversion from free to pay is up. We're seeing customer growth tick up. We're actually seeing expansion revenue, which means our customers are growing and they're upgrading what SKU they use. We're starting to see these, and these things really become future indicators of growth. And that's why the comment that I made earlier and Michelle made earlier around, we expect that the growth in Mailchimp to accelerate in the coming quarters because we're seeing the KPIs around customer growth, expansion retention, these things are starting to improve. So hopefully, that helps to answer your question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSteve Enders: I guess I just want to clarify a little bit on what you're seeing on the Credit Karma side and what you talked about historically on that front and what you're expecting for the guide here. I think before, you talk about expecting an acceleration kind of in the back half of the year as you kind of combine the cross-sell with TurboTax here. I guess, how are you thinking about that opportunity now given kind of where the macro is and what you're assuming versus the cross-sell that could potentially come here?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. We have taken -- thank you for the question. We have taken sort of a firewall approach here. One is we're very excited about the innovations that we talked about at Investor Day. And in fact, the only thing that's changed is we've added a few more innovations that we've launched within Credit Karma. The Marketplace that I shared earlier is one of them, where -- and it's almost at full scale where our customers see an additional tablet, a marketplace of all the products that are right for them in one place that brings more visibility and brings to the forefront products that are right for a specific cohort of customers. So in terms of the integration with TurboTax, you're going to see a far more robust experience this year with Credit Karma being integrated into TurboTax and vice versa. Credit Karma Guarantee continues to be on track in terms of a rollout to customer -- to members and financial institutions. All the innovations that we talked about, plus a few more are all on track, and we're equally as excited about the impact that it will have. And very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, what we talked about then was that these innovations were not reliant on a macro pickup. They're just -- they're going to deliver more benefits, and therefore, more monetization. Back to the word firewall, we're not counting on those innovations in our results when we think about the rest of the year. We're assuming current trends. We're assuming further conservatism for the remainder of the year. We're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates going up. And so therefore, that's informed our guide of minus 15% to minus 10%. And that's sort of separate and distinct from the innovation that we continue to be excited and focused on and are on track for the rollout.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And I guess just to clarify again on Mailchimp. I know that last quarter you were putting some changes in place to kind of improve conversion rates and really kind of rightsize or kind of build out some of the structure of that business. Like where are those changes you're making kind of at this point? And how should we kind of think about the level that so this kind of go in there to kind of more kind of rightsize that business?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Let me answer your question. I'm not sure what you mean by rightsize where -- is this -- we are very focused on investing in male and accelerating the growth combined with the QuickBooks platform. And I would say a couple of big things that we have put in place and are continuing to implement. One is really strengthening the leadership team at all levels. We're very excited about leaders that we -- had joined the Mailchimp family and with Radia's addition to the Mailchimp team with additional changes that we are making to continue to strengthen the team, very excited about the impact there because that's having a direct impact on innovation, which is the second point I want to make. I really like the velocity, particularly what I've seen in the last 90 days. And I actually hope to see Mailchimp being one of the highest-velocity innovative teams across the Company with the team that we have in place. And I think everything that I mentioned earlier that we have launched is a result of the impact of that team. And lastly, it's about impact. And we're starting to see the key performance indicators that I mentioned earlier uptick in the right direction, which means that almost a year in, it's not been quite a year, but almost a year in, I feel very good about sort of year two because we've put a lot of foundational things in place in year one. We have a lot of work still ahead of us. But a lot of the work is about turning this into a sort of a strong growth business and fueling the success of small businesses, and I feel like we are on that trajectory given what I've seen, particularly in the last 90 to 100 days.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Jester: Thanks for squeezing me in. Two quick ones. A lot of talk about the macro with regards to Credit Karma. I'd love to hear about how you're overlaying that macro on QuickBooks Capital and anything you might be doing differently there as the year progresses, given the uncertainty. And then secondarily, Sasan, you talked about some of the economic indicators you track for small business. Are you seeing consistency in the U.S. and international? Or is maybe one geography stronger than the other right now?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, absolutely. Let me start with your macro question and QuickBooks Capital. We have built incredible machine learning capabilities, where we literally can control the dial of which customers' capacity for customers on a daily basis. And QuickBooks Capital is very important for our customers, and it is not a material sort of revenue driver for the Company is, however, essential as part of our overall platform. So I think that what I would say is we're very good and has been very good. I think it's been proven, especially during the COVID times, to be able to adjust the doubt so that we offer capital only to those that we can see can pay it back. And remember, the loans that we typically give could be from 30 days to six months. And there's a ceiling for all of these loans. So we feel very good about the macro environment impact and how we manage our QuickBooks Capital within that context, and I think we've proven that during COVID. The second element of your question, I would love to sort of parse it out in two ways. One is even in the U.S., there are sectors within small business. Remember, we're very diversified in the small businesses that we serve. But there are segments within small businesses that have gotten hit hard, those that focus on auto sales, those that focus on financial services, those that focus on real estate. Some of their revenues are down 10% to 15%, but you don't really see that in our results because we're very, very diversified. We're not -- no one sector can really impact our overall results. So that's in context of the globe, but it's also in context of the U.S. Not every sector is created equal. Some sectors are hit hard, the ones that I just mentioned. I would say U.S. has been the strongest followed by Canada, and the ones that have been hit the hardest has been U.K., Australia and France. And again, our -- we're not -- we've not assumed any of this in our guidance, but our hope is those will, over time, begin to bounce back. We've not seen the bounce back yet, but they've been hit harder than the U.S.\nDaniel Jester: Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome. And I think that was the last question. And so maybe I can bring us to close by saying thank you for all of your wonderful questions. And be safe, and we look forward to seeing all of you for our second quarter earnings results. Until then, be safe. Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye.\nSasan Goodarzi: Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect",

            "name": "Michelle Clatterbuck",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $76 million versus $195 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $662 million versus $555 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 versus $0.82 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.53 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 38% during the quarter and 19% on an organic basis, excluding $264 million in Mailchimp revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 60% in Q1 or 28% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business & Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 29% in Q1 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 109% in Q1. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 28%. Mailchimp revenue included in online services was $264 million, up low teens versus a year ago, in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, and we began to execute our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 172% in Q1 and 19% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. As a reminder, the subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with QBO pricing. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits during the quarter. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 2% to $425 million in Q1. This was below our expectations of mid-single-digit growth we shared at Investor Day due to further deterioration in all verticals the last few weeks of the quarter. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards, offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans. As the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, we're seeing an impact across all verticals. Sasan touched on this briefly earlier, but let me unpack what we're seeing. In credit cards, many financial institution partners have tightened eligibility, particularly in riskier segments. In personal loans, we saw continued pressure with many partners tightening eligibility further while increasing APRs. We continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. As a result, we are reducing our fiscal 2023 Credit Karma revenue guidance to a decline of 15% to 10%. This embeds the current trends we're seeing and additional conservatism in the remainder of the year despite the expected continued rollout of several new innovations. Consumer Group revenue was $150 million, reflecting a strong finish to the tax season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted category in the tax prep market as we head into the next tax season. We're focused on making TurboTax a compelling destination for filers who prefer assistance to complete their taxes accurately and quickly. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue of $34 million was in line with our expectations. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $7 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable January 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared last quarter, we have an operating system we use to run the Company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. As Sasan shared earlier, we are reiterating our operating income and earnings per share expectations for fiscal year 2023 despite our lower revenue expectations for Credit Karma. We're able to do this by reducing spend in areas where we expect to see lower returns near term. Last quarter, I mentioned we identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios, and the adjustments we have made are an example. Given the breadth of our offerings and the power of our diversified platform, we have the ability to maintain earnings power despite our expectation for lower Credit Karma revenue. At the same time, we have the ability to make the necessary platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our short- and long-term commitments. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our revenue guidance for Credit Karma as trends in all verticals further deteriorated in the last few weeks of the quarter and into November. We now expect revenue to decline 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance range of 10% to 15% revenue growth. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for all other segments and now expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12% versus the previous range of 14% to 16%. For the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, we continue to expect 19% to 20% revenue growth. And for the Consumer Group, we continue to expect 9% to 10% revenue growth. In both businesses, we expect the majority of our growth this year to come from customer growth and mix. We are reiterating our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. This demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified platform and business model. So to recap, for fiscal year 2023, we expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP loss per share of $0.29 to $0.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.45. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Yes. Brad... No worries. No worries. Thank you, Brad. Yes, it is one of the things that we feel very good about. As I talked about on a previous call, when we were going through our planning for this year, we were really looking at making sure we had identified areas that we could take action on, the levers we could pull if we did see the macro environment get worse. Those things look like marketing expenses, things that we just don't think are going to pay off in the near term; other areas like travel, discretionary spend. But we are protecting R&D and our innovation. And we are continuing to invest. Our investments and our head count continue to go up across the Company. And yes, Credit Karma, we have taken the revenue down with a revenue hit there. But when we look at really being able to manage our expenses, it is looking across the Company holistically and really focusing on the areas where we think we're not going to see as much return in the short term so that we can continue to focus longer term and drive the innovation. Yes. The only thing I would clarify is that Mailchimp actually sold at U.S. dollars, and so there isn't a currency impact there for the international, even though 50% of their sales are outside the U.S."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Sasan Goodarzi",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong first quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to feel bullish about our momentum and execution across small business and tax. We're innovating at a high velocity using the power of our platform and modern technology capabilities to deliver new offerings at scale focusing on breakthrough adoption. We continue to be focused on putting more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. This is more important than ever in the current uncertain economic environment and helps us penetrate our large total addressable market of over $300 billion. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Revenue grew 29%, including 13 points from the addition of Mailchimp. Total revenue growth was fueled by the Small Business & Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 38% or 19% excluding Mailchimp and 25% revenue growth in the Consumer Group driven by a strong October peak with new customers and extension filers. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see charge volume growth, the number of employees paid, the hours worked per small business and cash reserves. These measures remain strong for those on our platform and inform our perspective on the health of small businesses. TurboTax had a robust finish to the tax season with a record number of innovations launched and tested in the October peak. I'm excited about this upcoming season, particularly our strategy to transform the assisted category, including the launch of Business Tax and TurboTax and Credit Karma platform integrations. Now turning to Credit Karma. At Investor Day and on our fourth quarter call earnings call, we shared that all Credit Karma verticals had been negatively impacted by the macro uncertainty. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into November, we saw further deterioration in all verticals. Consumer default rates remain relatively low by historical standards, reflecting strong consumer cash balances coming out of the pandemic. However, we continue to see partners pull back from extending credit, reflecting the uncertainty in the economic environment and the risk of deterioration in credit performance. Given this context, Credit Karma revenue came in lower than expected for the quarter. We are lowering our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for Credit Karma to a decline of 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 10% to 15% growth. At the same time, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for all other segments and reiterating our fiscal 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance. Our ability to maintain earnings power despite the lower Credit Karma revenue guidance shows the power of our diversified platform and our ability to balance platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our commitments. Regardless of the near-term macro volatility, we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% for Credit Karma driven by our vision and innovation to become the self-driving financial platform fueling prosperity for all consumers. At Investor Day, we shared how our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating our innovation and how our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate our success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across three of these Big Bets. Our first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our Big Bets. Our evolution from a siloed technology stack to a platform leveraging shared capabilities is well underway. Our development environment enables speed and innovation. Engineers now have 6x the velocity of deploying code, resulting in accelerated innovation compared to fiscal year 2020. Our AI and fintech capabilities are well positioned to solve our customers' biggest problems, such as our money innovations across payments and payroll, advancements in TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advance, just to name a few. And we're doing that today with over 730 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, 2 million AI models in production, 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and over $465 billion in money moved during fiscal year 2022. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customer face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. During the October tax peak, our team launched a record 50 innovations to test and learn. Our learnings can help us transform our go-to-market campaign for the assisted segment; revamp the end-to-end TurboTax Live platform experiences with faster access to money via Credit Karma; and better serve the investor, Latino and self-employed segments. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. With Mailchimp, we're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we launched a new brand campaign, refreshed our website and launched an improved first-time use experience for new customers that help them more quickly find and use the feature that aligns with their unique business needs. We also launched a one-hour assisted onboarding process for our high-value Mailchimp customers with the goal of guiding them to more advanced features to increase awareness and usage. This program was launched in a record four weeks by leveraging components of our virtual expert platform, another example of the power of the Intuit platform capabilities. As a result of these enhancements and others, we're seeing a positive impact on customer growth and expansion and a lift in customers converting to pay. Turning to our money portfolio. We've made a tremendous investment over the last few years to expand our suite of money offerings to help small businesses get paid, pay others and access capital and manage their money. We continue to see strength in our charge volume driven by easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront. This quarter, we made it even easier for more customers to access their cash quickly by removing friction and opening the funnel to more customers. We're also rolling out a new invoicing experience with a more streamlined workflow and improved design, which is driving an increase in the percentage of companies that send payment-enabled invoices. Looking ahead, we're tackling another big challenge for our small business customers, B2B payments. More than $2 trillion of invoices were managed in QuickBooks in fiscal year 2022. As we shared at Investor Day, we are launching the QuickBooks Business Network, which connects small business customers each other, making it easier for them to do business. It's currently in beta testing, and we expect to launch more broadly later this fiscal year. We're also building our own bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. We're excited about our opportunities for growth with Mailchimp and payments becoming the center of small business growth. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy and the power of our platform. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever for our customers. We have a large TAM with low penetration, secular shifts working in our favor, a diversified large-scale platform where we continue to invest heavily in innovation across our 5 Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers, resulting in top line growth and margin expansion. We're proud to be an employer of choice as well as the financial technology platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Great. Thank you, Michelle. As you all heard from Michelle and I, we're seeing continued momentum as a result of our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform, growing Intuit double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. And with that, let me turn it over to your questions. Yes. Thanks for your question, Siti. So a couple of things. One, as you heard from Michelle, we took the current sort of trends that we were seeing in sort of end of October into November into account. But we also very intentionally included further conservatism, deterioration just to be prudent. And so when we look at things around delinquency rates and unemployment, which is really what financial institutions look at to make future decisions, although they are at historical lows, the assumption is that they're going to deteriorate. And so we just assumed that they will significantly deteriorate, and we wanted to include that in our go-forward guidance. We take a lot of pride in the commitments that we make at the Company level, and we want to make sure that we're very prudent in terms of the assumptions that we made with the guidance going forward. With that said, I think what I would amplify is our innovation that we talked about at Investor Day. Beyond things like Karma Guarantee, we are actually -- we have launched, it's almost at full scale, something called the Marketplace, where we're giving more exposure to personalize experiences around cards and personal loans to our members. And now with the integration of Mint and Credit Karma, which was part of our refreshed Big Bet three vision that we talked about at Investor Day, we expect in the future to have additional sort of capabilities and innovations for our prime customers, which has not been our sweet spot in -- on the Credit Karma platform. So we are leaning into our innovation and those possibilities. We are not counting on any of that impacting the growth rate that you just heard from Michelle and I for the fiscal year, and we just simply believe that's the right thing to do. Yes. Sure. Absolutely. First of all, I would start by saying we have a lot of visibility into things around consumer spending, which is charge volume. We see the number of employees, whether they're going up and down. We see a number of hours worked. We see cash reserves. And of course, there's our metrics around acquisition, retention, payments and payroll volume and also what we see across Mailchimp. And what we're seeing across the board is a continued flight to digitization. If you use our payments capability, you get paid faster, and cash flow is more critical in this environment. If you use our payroll capabilities, you're actually able to reduce errors and pay your employees and have money moved from your bank account to their bank account same day versus two weeks in advance. With the use of innovation that you've heard from us on Mailchimp, we're actually starting to see customer growth tick up. And so those are just illustrative examples are -- we're just continuing to see based on our innovation a flight to digitization, which is the strength that you heard from us in the first quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue the rest of the year. And we remain steadfast on our guidance until we see more quarters, but it is not at all about our sentiment about small business. We actually feel very good about what we're seeing across the board in small business. Sorry, Michelle, go ahead. I was going to ask who the question was for. But Michelle, please go ahead. Sure. Absolutely. I think the way to think about it is in the long term and from a trajectory perspective, we should see ARPU go up. And now every year, strategically, we make decisions in terms of where we may expand our free offering or where we may increase price based on the leverage that we see in the marketplace, which is primarily in our assisted offerings. And those were some of the adjustments that we made last year. And as we look into this year, we actually feel very good about our do-it-yourself platform lineup. And really, our biggest leverage is going to come from accelerating what we're seeing across the TurboTax Live platform, which is really where the growth is coming from. It's really where the ARPU comes from, and it's where our biggest opportunity is with a $20 billion TAM in front of us. And of course, overtime, opening up an additional $10 billion TAM with business taxes. So that was really the intent and the logic behind why ARPU was probably a little bit slower growth last year versus prior years. And I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to see ARPU growth into the future, and a lot of it will come from the assisted segment. And that's really part of our plan that we're executing against this coming year. Yes. Perfect. Yes. Absolutely. Great question. This was actually at Investor Day one of our, what we call Horizon 3 ideas that we have invested in, which is around externalizing services. So first and foremost, we do see a big problem space out there where developers and partners and firms look to access and have a need for things like around our virtual expert platform services to connect people to experts or had to use for our identity services and have a use for our fraud and risk capabilities. So there's a lot of services that we have across our platform that you heard Mariana talk about of which there is a need for those services externally. Now we want to be very choiceful and intentional what we choose to externalize and what we choose not to externalize and what problems we choose to solve and which ones we intentionally choose not to solve. But we do believe it as an opportunity, it's actually something that we funded about a little bit over 15 months ago, and we have a mission-based team that is working on it. And when we have more to share in terms of launches and anything that we think over time will be material for all of you to be aware, we'll be the first to share with you. But we do see it as an exciting Horizon 3 idea that's been funded and are excited about the prospects of it. Yes. Absolutely. First of all, I'll just state that I'm really excited about Rania that we just put into the business and the leadership team that she is building in. It is the result of that leadership team where we are seeing accelerated innovation. And as I mentioned a moment ago, there's been a lot of innovation just in the last sort of three to four months in Mailchimp from an entirely new brand campaign where we communicate the benefit to how you can grow your business to SMBs, both on air and on -- through digital assets. We've redesigned our website. So when you come to us, you're very clear about the benefits that we offer, the choices that you have and why it can help fuel the success of your business to then revamping the first-time use experience, along with what we have just implemented for, I would say, higher-value, larger Mailchimp customers and new customers that we want to pursue, which is a one-hour assisted onboarding to help you get on to the platform to help you understand the benefits of the platform. And in context of what we've shared around international and Mailchimp as sort of the lead internationally, we are right now focused on localizing the language. Where we have localized language versus not, we have more than 13 points conversion variants. And so of course, localized language is one of our largest levers internationally along with having a playbook that we're putting in place around go-to-market to raise awareness. So a lot of those things we have already launched that I mentioned and the localizing languages we're working on as we speak. And a lot of what we -- what I just shared, we're starting to see a real impact from customer uptick, expansion revenue. And we're excited about the possibilities and the momentum that the leadership team is building. Yes. Sure, Kirk. And let me try to be descriptive about it, so I'm not overly generic. I think our customers that we serve, the small businesses between zero to 100 employees don't as much think about back office, front office. They just really look to have a platform to be able to grow their business and to be able to manage their cash flow. So if you think about our QuickBooks platform, let me start there, and I'll get to a jump in a moment. Really, QuickBooks helps you manage your cash flow, all your money coming in and money going out. And the notion of digitization is really important for customers, which is why we're enjoying the growth that we just shared. And that really comes down to customers can use QuickBooks to be organized. They can get paid much faster with using our payments capabilities. They can get access to capital. They can have instant money flow from their bank to their employees' banks by using our payroll. If they're out in the field, they can use our time tracking so everything is automated. All those things are about digitization. And the way small businesses think about it is it actually helps them with their cash flow because we also -- with all those capabilities, project your cash flow. So that's the real big value sort of QuickBooks. And then you add to that Mailchimp. The real value of Mailchimp is don't think about it as these are not enterprise customers. These are smaller, small businesses that where their sort of lifeline comes from being able to reach out and manage their existing customers but also effectively be able to grow their customer base. And so the reason we're continuing to see an uptick based on our innovation and based on just good execution. And I think the best is yet ahead of us in Mailchimp is that is separate and distinct from do I spend more money on advertising dollars. When you use Mailchimp, you have the ability to use our tools with a subscription that you pay on a monthly basis to be able to in an automated way, reach out to your customers, market to new customers. And we're seeing sort of equal demand -- if I go back to your frame of front office versus back office, I think where there is slower spend and declining is spending money on advertising dollars. That is not what -- Mailchimp is not impacted by advertising dollars. It's actually a -- it's a platform that you use to be able to manage your customers even if you choose to spend less advertising dollars. You can still use Mailchimp very effectively to be able to manage your customers. So that's why the demand is strong with Mailchimp and QuickBooks, and that's really what we see across the platform. Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And I just want to acknowledge that you and others were pushing us on our Credit Karma side at Investor Day. And let me just start at the top level to share sort of what we've learned and what we've adjusted, and then I'll answer your question. When we look across tax, which is 35% of the Company; and then when you look at across small business, which is over 50% of the Company, so that's like 86% of the Company, we have sort of -- which includes Mailchimp, we have proven and tried KPIs that allows us to see things well into sort of the future not only to ensure that we're investing in all the right things, but also be able to be very intentional and thoughtful about how we guide because we take our guidance very seriously. One of the things that we learned with Credit Karma is there are two factors that we look at but we did not take into account: one is unemployment, the other is delinquency rates. And what I mean by that, not taking it into account as we view it, we look at it, and they're at historical lows. And the one thing that we learned from this process, what we are adjusting and have adjusted our KPIs is just looking at where they are today, but also projecting where they could be a year from now and ultimately projecting what could happen if we were sitting in the shoes of some of the partners that are on our platform. So that is a very important shift, which actually gets at the point you made around our Credit Karma guidance. We feel that it is absolutely derisked. We -- as you heard from Michelle and I, we have built a deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year because we have taken into account uptick in both unemployment and delinquency rates, and therefore, have put out a guidance that we believe is the risk. To go to the second part of your question, tax, which is 35% of the Company, that is really economically resilient. So let me focus my answer on Small Business. Because of our KPIs and the rich data that we have access to and what we see within Small Business, we actually feel like our guidance in Small Business is derisked because we make certain assumptions around how things will potentially play out the remainder of the year that we took into account when we set the initial guidance, and we still feel very good about the guidance. And you can see based on what we delivered in Q1, we can just do the math and see what it means for the rest of the year. So we feel very good about the way we set guidance in those two businesses. We feel very good about the guidance in those areas for the rest of the year. And hopefully, my explanation made sense around Credit Karma. Yes. It's actually -- it is in constant currency. I mean maybe, Michele, I'll let you chime in here in a moment. But I think what I would say is we -- when you look at our innovation and when you look at our customer uptick and the expansion revenue that we're starting to see, it's actually very much in line with what we would have expected because a lot of our innovation that is in place is actually now accelerating the growth of the business. Because remember, this business was run for cash flow and profitability, and now we're running it for growth. And we're actually quite pleased with the impact that we're starting to see, and we would expect that to accelerate in the upcoming quarters. But Michelle, do you want to chime in on the currency version? Yes. Thanks for the question, Kash. Just in terms of your question around assumptions, I think on Credit Karma, hopefully, what I just shared a moment ago resonated in that. We are assuming sort of further deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year or the remainder of the year, I should say. Despite a lot of innovation that is still coming to market because we're just -- we're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates getting worse, which means that financial institutions, although we're one of the last platforms they pull off of that they will be conservative in terms of their investment levels. So those are the assumptions that we've made for the remainder of the fiscal year for Credit Karma. And for Small Business, a lot of the strength that we're continuing to see is just -- it's a shift to digitization from folks that are already on our platform. So we have a lot of customers that are on our platform. If you remember, we used the figure of -- there's $2 trillion of invoices being managed on our platform, and we have over $100 million that is part of our -- well over $100 million as part of our payments charge volume, which means we have a huge opportunity to penetrate that within our existing base. And I use that just as an illustrative example, Kash. To answer your question, we're not making any assumptions around payments uptick because the macro environment will get better in the second half of the year. We're actually assuming that a lot of the growth that we are seeing is just continuing shift to digitization from those that are on our platform. And so we make customer acquisition assumptions. We make attrition assumptions. We'll look at assumptions around payments and payroll that are really in context of how we feel about the environment going forward. Although we're not seeing it within our SMB segment, we are assuming a level of conservatism as we think about the remainder of the year. And those are the assumptions that we've made for both Small Business and Credit Karma. And tax, again, tax is economically resilient. We pretty much make assumptions based on our penetration in the assisted segment. And that's really -- that and the total number of IRS returns is where our assumptions come from. And again, those are -- that's economically resilient. So that's how we think about the guide going forward as we just reiterated. In terms of payments, listen, payments is one of the areas that we're the most excited about. If I had to pick a couple of areas, it's Mailchimp, it's payments and it's what we're doing to go upmarket and with QuickBooks Advanced and mid-market. And with payments, we spent four or five years building out all of our fraud and risk capabilities, all of our AI capabilities, and we're just innovating very fast with that team. And a lot of the future around what we can do to digitize B2B around what's possible with bill pay, that -- those are yet to come and not even in our forecast going forward because we just believe that there's so much room for penetration attached going forward. So hopefully, our say and payments has been to your liking, but we think our best is yet ahead of us. Yes. Sure, Scott. First of all, it is -- as you said, it's a large part of the overall Credit Karma platform. With that said, I'll start with context that when you look at the 129 million customers or members that we serve on Credit Karma, the majority of our focus has been sub-prime and near-prime customers. And that's really a lot of our personalized experiences are for those cohorts. And one of the things that we're very excited about that we have shared at Investor Day is we're also building out capabilities and innovation for prime customers. And that's why we shifted Mint over, and we're combining the Mint and Credit Karma platform. So that context is important because as you hear my answer, just hear it from the lens of the majority of where our business comes from is sub-prime and near-prime. In the future, we'll also have capabilities, innovation and ultimately, revenue that will come up front and prime as well, which positions us really well in the marketplace. And with all of that said, in essence, yes, we're continuing to see growth in credit cards, but we're actually assuming that, that will really deteriorate the rest of the year based on unemployment going up and delinquency rates going up. And as you heard from both Michelle and I, we have built conservatism into the remainder of the year. And so there's -- which will ultimately result in declining growth rate. But what we saw in Q1 and the growth rate of the 2%, a lot of the headwinds in other verticals was offset by credit cards. But we have assumed that, that will get worse over time. Yes. Sure. I'm actually glad you asked about our second quarter guide of 8% to 9%. First of all, our momentum in Small Business continues into Q2. There are two elements that drive our guide of 8% to 9% revenue growth in second quarter. One is we always make assumptions for tax. As you know, tax is tricky between second quarter and third quarter. And we make assumptions around when the IRS will open, forms availability, and those assumptions drive what we assume will happen in our tax business. And in some cases, we have elements of our tax business that actually we've assumed may decline in the second quarter. So that drives our guidance overall at the Company level for Q2. And then Q2 generally has been seasonally the weakest quarter for Credit Karma because of the month of November, December and January and then just the number of holidays. It's seasonally the weakest quarter. So when you combine our assumptions with tax and you combine our assumptions with Credit Karma, that's where you get Q2 where it is. And hopefully, that answers your question. Yes. Sure. Absolutely. The majority of our guide for the year and what we also saw in Q1 actually came from customer growth and mix, and mix includes things like QuickBooks Advanced. And you saw from our online services growth of 28%, we're seeing really sort of good growth from Payroll, Payments, Time Tracking. And that, of course, excludes Mailchimp, and we talk about Mailchimp separately. So I think the short answer to your question is we are seeing the type of balance that we would want, which is our growth coming from customer growth and mix and price will play an element -- a smaller element, but it plays an important element as we look at not only what we saw in Q1, but what we expect for the remainder of the year. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. I mean if you go back to when we closed the deal almost a year ago, one of the things that we were very clear about, in addition to our excitement around the asset and the fact that now combined with QuickBooks, we can have one growth platform that can be the source of truth for -- and the source of growth for a small business, one of the things that we reiterated was that this was really a business that was run for profitability and it was run for cash flow. And even particularly in COVID times, where you saw a lot of front-office company accelerates, Mailchimp really didn't because, again, it was more run for cash flow and profitability. And so we worked very hard in the last year to put a playbook in place in context of the priorities that we've shared to accelerate growth. And those priorities, they always take time to shift the business from being run for profitability and cash flow to be run for a growth business typically takes a couple of years. And we're actually starting to see a trajectory change within the first year. And we're quite demanding of ourselves in terms of the velocity that we would like to see. So really, what's happened there last year is we were taking a business that was, again, run for profitability, cash flow to revamping the website coming up with a new campaign, revamping the product. And when I say revamp, it's not done. We've not reached the destination. It's just the beginning of what's possible to really focus on high-value customers to position ourselves to go after mid-market to start ramping up what we can do internationally. All of these things, we're starting to now see indicators where in the quarter, although it was sequentially flat from a revenue perspective, we're seeing conversion from free to pay is up. We're seeing customer growth tick up. We're actually seeing expansion revenue, which means our customers are growing and they're upgrading what SKU they use. We're starting to see these, and these things really become future indicators of growth. And that's why the comment that I made earlier and Michelle made earlier around, we expect that the growth in Mailchimp to accelerate in the coming quarters because we're seeing the KPIs around customer growth, expansion retention, these things are starting to improve. So hopefully, that helps to answer your question. Yes. We have taken -- thank you for the question. We have taken sort of a firewall approach here. One is we're very excited about the innovations that we talked about at Investor Day. And in fact, the only thing that's changed is we've added a few more innovations that we've launched within Credit Karma. The Marketplace that I shared earlier is one of them, where -- and it's almost at full scale where our customers see an additional tablet, a marketplace of all the products that are right for them in one place that brings more visibility and brings to the forefront products that are right for a specific cohort of customers. So in terms of the integration with TurboTax, you're going to see a far more robust experience this year with Credit Karma being integrated into TurboTax and vice versa. Credit Karma Guarantee continues to be on track in terms of a rollout to customer -- to members and financial institutions. All the innovations that we talked about, plus a few more are all on track, and we're equally as excited about the impact that it will have. And very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, what we talked about then was that these innovations were not reliant on a macro pickup. They're just -- they're going to deliver more benefits, and therefore, more monetization. Back to the word firewall, we're not counting on those innovations in our results when we think about the rest of the year. We're assuming current trends. We're assuming further conservatism for the remainder of the year. We're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates going up. And so therefore, that's informed our guide of minus 15% to minus 10%. And that's sort of separate and distinct from the innovation that we continue to be excited and focused on and are on track for the rollout. Sure. Let me answer your question. I'm not sure what you mean by rightsize where -- is this -- we are very focused on investing in male and accelerating the growth combined with the QuickBooks platform. And I would say a couple of big things that we have put in place and are continuing to implement. One is really strengthening the leadership team at all levels. We're very excited about leaders that we -- had joined the Mailchimp family and with Radia's addition to the Mailchimp team with additional changes that we are making to continue to strengthen the team, very excited about the impact there because that's having a direct impact on innovation, which is the second point I want to make. I really like the velocity, particularly what I've seen in the last 90 days. And I actually hope to see Mailchimp being one of the highest-velocity innovative teams across the Company with the team that we have in place. And I think everything that I mentioned earlier that we have launched is a result of the impact of that team. And lastly, it's about impact. And we're starting to see the key performance indicators that I mentioned earlier uptick in the right direction, which means that almost a year in, it's not been quite a year, but almost a year in, I feel very good about sort of year two because we've put a lot of foundational things in place in year one. We have a lot of work still ahead of us. But a lot of the work is about turning this into a sort of a strong growth business and fueling the success of small businesses, and I feel like we are on that trajectory given what I've seen, particularly in the last 90 to 100 days. Yes, absolutely. Let me start with your macro question and QuickBooks Capital. We have built incredible machine learning capabilities, where we literally can control the dial of which customers' capacity for customers on a daily basis. And QuickBooks Capital is very important for our customers, and it is not a material sort of revenue driver for the Company is, however, essential as part of our overall platform. So I think that what I would say is we're very good and has been very good. I think it's been proven, especially during the COVID times, to be able to adjust the doubt so that we offer capital only to those that we can see can pay it back. And remember, the loans that we typically give could be from 30 days to six months. And there's a ceiling for all of these loans. So we feel very good about the macro environment impact and how we manage our QuickBooks Capital within that context, and I think we've proven that during COVID. The second element of your question, I would love to sort of parse it out in two ways. One is even in the U.S., there are sectors within small business. Remember, we're very diversified in the small businesses that we serve. But there are segments within small businesses that have gotten hit hard, those that focus on auto sales, those that focus on financial services, those that focus on real estate. Some of their revenues are down 10% to 15%, but you don't really see that in our results because we're very, very diversified. We're not -- no one sector can really impact our overall results. So that's in context of the globe, but it's also in context of the U.S. Not every sector is created equal. Some sectors are hit hard, the ones that I just mentioned. I would say U.S. has been the strongest followed by Canada, and the ones that have been hit the hardest has been U.K., Australia and France. And again, our -- we're not -- we've not assumed any of this in our guidance, but our hope is those will, over time, begin to bounce back. We've not seen the bounce back yet, but they've been hit harder than the U.S. You're very welcome. And I think that was the last question. And so maybe I can bring us to close by saying thank you for all of your wonderful questions. And be safe, and we look forward to seeing all of you for our second quarter earnings results. Until then, be safe. Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye. Goodbye."

We delivered very strong results for the fourth quarter and full-year, and made meaningful progress with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and Big Bets that position the company for durable growth in the future. Our full-year revenue grew 13% and we delivered strong operating margin expansion demonstrating the strength and momentum of our investments and innovation. As we exit the year, we are confident in delivering another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2025. Intuit is the global AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. Our strategy and five Big Bets position Intuit as a mission critical platform that delivers end-to-end solutions, driving sustained growth. We made an early bet on AI. We have a significant advantage with the scale of our data, investments in AI capabilities such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, and GenAI, and our large network of AI-powered virtual experts. This is enabling us to disrupt the categories in which we operate. We are transforming how we serve our customers by delivering done-for-you experiences, where we do the hard work for them, connecting them with AI-powered human expertise to fuel their success. With the introduction of GenAI, we are now delivering reimagined customer experiences and bolstering businesses' growth potential, while driving efficiencies in how work gets done within Intuit. This has enabled us to build our large AI-driven expert platform to fuel the success of consumers, small and mid-market businesses. The progress we've made has bolstered our confidence, leading us to accelerate investments in five key areas within our Big Bets to deliver greater impact in the future. I\u2019ll spend a moment unpacking the progress we\u2019ve made and our investment plans for the future: First, within Big Bet 1, we are delivering done-for-you experiences with Intuit Assist. In fiscal year 2024, we made strong progress making Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistant, available to millions of consumers and approximately 1 million small and mid-market businesses. We are accelerating our investments to rollout Intuit Assist at scale in the coming year. Second, within Big Bet 2, we are accelerating platform and go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI-powered experts across our business offerings. In fiscal year 2024, TurboTax Live revenue grew 17%, and full-service customers doubled while those new to TurboTax tripled. QuickBooks Live customers more than tripled. We expect our accelerated investment in these areas to deepen our penetration in very manual, high-priced, and dis-aggregated assisted categories. By digitizing how services are delivered, an integral part of our done-for-you platform experiences, we will become the AI-powered financial assistant for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. Next, within Big Bet 4, our money solutions, we are making additional investments to accelerate digitizing the experience end-to-end for consumers, small and mid-market businesses, from estimate, to invoicing, to getting paid and paying bills. In fiscal year 2024, the total online payment volume we facilitated on our platform grew 20%. We also helped small businesses access $2.4 billion in financing through QuickBooks Capital, up 28%, and we made significant progress digitizing B2B payments with our bill pay offering, for which monthly payment volume processed quadrupled over the last six months. In fiscal year 2025, we expect these accelerated investments to deliver best-in-class, seamless payments, capital, banking, bill pay, and invoicing solutions. Next, within Big Bet 5, we are doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in the platform and go-to-market motions. In fiscal year 2024, QBO Advanced customers grew 28%. In fiscal year 2025, we are accelerating investments to better serve customers who have more complex needs, such as more sophisticated accounting and reporting requirements, business intelligence, money solutions, human capital management, professional services, and customer acquisition solutions with Mailchimp, all assisted by AI-powered human experts. And finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks. We\u2019ve translated the Mailchimp offering into five different languages for markets where we see a large TAM. Looking ahead, we are bringing QuickBooks and Mailchimp together to create a single growth platform, differentiated in the markets where we have product market fit, including in Canada, U.K., and Australia. In other geographies, we are leading with Mailchimp's strong international footprint to help small businesses get customers as we continue to localize the offering. Wrapping up, with the progress and momentum we are delivering, and the accelerated investment areas I've shared, we are in a great position to win as an end-to-end platform with experiences that fuel the success of customers. Intuit is the AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. With that -- now let me hand it over to Sandeep.\nSandeep Aujla: Thanks, Sasan. We delivered very strong results in fiscal 2024 across the company, including total revenue growth of 13%, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 40 and 100 basis points, respectively, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 24% and 18%, respectively. Our fourth quarter results include: Revenue of $3.2 billion, up 17%. GAAP operating loss of $151 million, versus GAAP operating income of $17 million last year, reflecting a restructuring charge of $223 million recognized in the quarter related to the organizational changes we announced in July. Non-GAAP operating income of $730 million, versus $627 million last year, up 16%. GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.07, versus diluted earnings per share of $0.32 a year ago, also reflecting the restructuring charge. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99, versus $1.65 last year, up 21%. Turning to the business segments: In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, the revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and 19% for the full-year. This momentum demonstrates the power of our small and mid-market business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings as customers look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. Online ecosystem revenue grew 18% during the quarter and 20% for the full-year, driven by our progress serving customers with more complex needs and adoption of our ecosystem of services. As a result, online ecosystem ARPC grew 11% in fiscal 2024. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 17% in Q4 and 19% in fiscal 2024. Growth for the quarter and year was driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. We delivered growth in our declared strategic areas this year, with our emphasis on serving customers with more complex needs. This focus drove U.S. QBO customers excluding self-employed up 11%, QBO Advanced customers up 28%, while QBO self-employed customers declined 14%, resulting in total online paying customers up 6%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 19% in Q4, driven by payments, payroll, capital, and Mailchimp. For the full fiscal year 2024, Online services revenue grew 21%, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp and capital. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher effective prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q4 was 19%, relatively consistent with the range we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices, and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth continues to be impacted by the lapping of a larger benefit from price and line-up changes that we made last year in Q2 and Q3. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and line-up. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 11% in Q4 and 13% in fiscal 2024. Turning to desktop. We successfully concluded the three-year transition to a subscription model, which contributed to 25% desktop ecosystem revenue growth in Q4 and 16% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low-30s in Q4, and in the high-teens for fiscal year 2024. Our Q4 desktop ecosystem revenue growth also reflects the offering changes we made in early fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model. These changes resulted in approximately $60 million of desktop revenue recognized in Q4 and approximately $50 million recognized in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, all of which would have otherwise been recognized in Q1 of fiscal 2025. We also expect approximately $50 million of desktop revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in Q1 fiscal 2025 to shift to later quarters in fiscal 2025. In total, these changes lower Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue by approximately $160 million and are largely related to more frequent product updates, beginning in Q4 of fiscal 2024, to align the customer delivery experience to our subscription model. Accordingly, we expect Q1 desktop ecosystem revenue to decline approximately 20% for Q1, but for desktop ecosystem revenue to return to growth in Q2. Overall, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to grow in the low-single-digits in fiscal 2025. Turning to Credit Karme. Credit Karma revenue growth improved each quarter during fiscal 2024, from a 5%, decline in Q1 to 14% growth in Q4. On a product basis in Q4, auto insurance accounted for 6 points of growth, personal loans accounted for 5 points, credit cards accounted for 2 points, and Credit Karma Money accounted for 1 point. Full-year revenue was $1.7 billion, up 5%. We are pleased with the momentum driven by our relentless focus on what matters most to our members and partners. We made strong progress this year redesigning the Credit Karma app to enable members to see much more of their financial life and find the products right for them. We also introduced Intuit Assist to deliver personalized financial insights using data and AI, increased monetization in the underpenetrated Prime segment, and made it easier than ever for consumers to benefit from the Credit Karma and TurboTax product integration. I\u2019m proud of the progress the team made innovating on behalf of our members and partners. Consumer and ProTax Groups. Consumer Group revenue of $4.4 billion grew 7% in fiscal 2024 as we continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. TurboTax Live revenue grew 17%, and customers grew 11%. Full-service customers doubled, while those new to TurboTax tripled. We are pleased with the momentum we saw with TurboTax Live again this season. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $599 million in fiscal 2024, up 7%. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $255 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2.0 billion during fiscal 2024. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share, payable on October 18, 2024. This represents a 16% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, our fiscal 2025 guidance includes: Total company revenue of $18.16 billion to $18.347 billion, growth of 12% to 13%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, including online ecosystem revenue growth of approximately 20% and desktop ecosystem revenue growth in the low-single-digits. Our guidance also includes revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and 5% to 8% for Credit Karma. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $12.34 to $12.54, growth of 18% to 20%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $19.16 to $19.36, growth of 13% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2025. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $24 million restructuring charge related to the reorganization we announced in July. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 includes: Total company revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including: Small Business and Self-Employed group revenue growth of 6% to 7%, reflecting the revenue shift in Q1 resulting from the desktop offering changes that I noted earlier. We expect desktop ecosystem revenue to decline approximately 20% in Q1, and the online ecosystem, which is our growth catalyst, to accelerate to approximately 19% growth in Q1. For Credit Karma, we expect revenue to grow in Q1. And for Consumer Group and ProTax revenue to decline in Q1, as we are lapping the period a year ago that included the extended California tax filing deadline. GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.66, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.33 to $2.38. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $19 million restructuring charge that we expect to incur in Q1 related to the reorganization we announced in July. You can find our full fiscal 2025 and Q1 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. I will now shift to our long-term growth expectations for each of our business segments. First, small business. With the momentum we see in online ecosystem growth, we are reiterating our long-term revenue growth expectations for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group of 15% to 20%. As part of this, we continue to expect online paying ARPC growth of 10% to 20%, and we now expect online paying customer growth of 5% to 10%. This reflects our shift in emphasis towards ARPC as we scale mid-market, drive growth in services, and reshape how we go-to-market as one business platform to significantly increase adoption of all our offerings. While there are relatively fewer mid-market customers, the ARPC of mid-market QuickBooks Online customers is nearly 3 times higher than other QuickBooks Online customers. Turning to Credit Karma, we are excited about the opportunity ahead as we execute our strategy to more deeply penetrate our core verticals, scale in growth verticals and execute our consumer ecosystem strategy. With the learnings from operating in the current business cycle, we are updating our long-term revenue growth expectations to 10% to 15%, reflecting the current size and scale of the business, and as we focus on creating seamless, end-to-end experiences with TurboTax that benefit consumers from year-round. Finally, the Consumer Group. Based on the momentum we saw this season, and the significant runway we have ahead to penetrate our TAM, we expect assisted penetration to be the key driver of future growth. TurboTax Live revenue accounted for approximately 30% of Consumer Group revenue in fiscal 2024, and we expect it to become the majority of Consumer Group revenue in the coming years. With that context, while we are scaling assisted, we are adjusting the Consumer Group long-term revenue growth rate to 6% to 10% in this interim period, with TurboTax Live revenue expected to grow 15% to 20%. One final note before I wrap up. Starting in Q1, we will be changing the name of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group to Global Business Solutions Group. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, and our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks Sandeep. We are confident in our long term growth strategy, including double-digit revenue growth and operating income growing faster than revenue. We have the strategy to win given the green shoots we're observing, and with less than 5% penetration of our $300 billion in TAM, with a massive runway ahead. We look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day next month, where we\u2019ll unpack all of this and more. Let\u2019s now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Goodarzi. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Siti Panigrahi at Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Great. Thank you. If one question, then Sasan, I will focus on small business segment, 19% growth is pretty good in this environment, where we are hearing about SMB weakness. But I want to focus on your growth in \u201825 -- fiscal '25 and beyond. Now it looks like your focus is now driving growth through targeting mid-market. You talked about that and renamed that. So help us understand how big is that opportunity to expand into mid-market? And why is this the right time for Intuit to increase focus on mid-market? And is it mostly targeting this, your QuickBooks customer base? Or are you planning to gain share from other vendors?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. First of all, I want to start with our focus will continue to be Small Businesses that are formed and because we want to fundamentally continue to grow with them. With that as context, we've just simply doubled down on our focus on mid-market. And as you know, it's not new. This has been five years in the making. It's one of the five Bets that we declared more than five years ago. But I would just say, five years later, Siti, we are just building an incredible amount of momentum. With that as context, let me just now answer your question. One, the way to think about it is we now have a business suite. And our business suite provides all the capabilities to -- for our business to be able to grow their customers, manage their customers, be able to manage their cash flow, get their accounting done, all in 1 place. And with our really AI-powered innovation and AI-powered experts, we really have tilted the professional grade help and services to all of our businesses. And we are now at a place where we are really accelerating on two fronts. One, we are going to go to market as one platform versus pieces and parts to really accelerate services penetration because of the one thing we continue to hear from businesses is that they want to do everything in one place and now we have the business suite for them to do everything in one place. Secondarily is our acceleration in mid-market. We're actually excited to announce at Investor Day a platform that will take us even further up market, and that really positions us to not only grow with our customers but to really acquire new customers. I would just remind us that the majority of mid-market customers are nonconsumption. And they pay a lot of money to use multiple different apps, discrete apps that don't talk to each other. Excel spreadsheets, Google Sheets, shoe boxes, and paying for multiple different bookkeepers, marketing agents and ultimately, accountants. And now we have packaged all of that as one enterprise suite to be able to pursue and accelerate pursuing mid-market customers. And our ultimate goal is to go far beyond 10 to 100 employees. And so I think this is five years in the making. And to round out the answer to your question, this is both focusing on the smaller customers, but we're really doubling down on the larger customers and really being able to penetrate services. And that's really what gives us confidence in the 20% online ecosystem revenue growth at a far bigger scale that you heard from Sandeep, along with our acceleration in Q1.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. I look forward to hearing more at the investors' day.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about Consumer, the guide for the coming year, the updated mid-term guide. If you can just walk through a little bit of the puts and takes where -- why was that the right place to start the annual guide, what could drive upside surprise as the tax season progresses? And maybe, Sasan, just your view on kind of the macroeconomic backdrop that, that Consumer guide is set against?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, absolutely, Alex. Thank you for your question. Let me start with the last part of your question, which is around the macro environment. We have not assumed anything other than the current environment. We're not assuming any tailwinds coming from the macro environment. So that's really been one of the elements that's informed our guidance. It's really about our current trends that we're seeing our current momentum that we're seeing and really all focused on our own execution. So that's really the first part of your question. I would say the second part is just as a refresher, the total tax market is about $35 billion in TAM, $5 billion of that is do-it-yourself and about $30 billion is both -- is all assisted, but consumer and on the business side. We've got great momentum. As you know, TurboTax Live grew 17% this past year, but the number of full-service customers that we got double, new to the franchise tripled. And so we have a lot of momentum as we look ahead, and that's why we have a lot of confidence in really providing an expectation that we expect TurboTax Live to grow between 15% to 20%. And that really leads to -- we wanted to just adjust our long-term expectations to be really prudent because until TurboTax Live, which today is 30% of our franchise, growing high-double-digits, until that becomes a larger part of our franchise, we wanted to be prudent with our long-term expectation. I will just end with saying that DIY is actually very important, and I would parse it into two. One, we're actually growing quite rapidly, and I would say, high-single-digits with complex customers with higher income, and we're actually accelerating taking share. And based on our learnings this year and based on our trade-offs that we made this year and our focus this year, we're going to be quite assertive in continuing to pursue lower income customers this year because we have a lot of green shoots from this past year with our experiments of how to deliver benefits and monetize beyond tax with our Credit Karma platform. And so we're going to be leaning into that. And I'll just end with the final aspect of the question that you asked, really are upside to our guide, which is, I think, a question you asked around TurboTax comes from really two dimensions. One, accelerating in assisted tax beyond the 15% to 20%; and two, actually accelerating where we've seen a lot of green shoots, which is the more complex, higher income customers that are DIY. We have positioned ourselves for the innovation and the lineup that's required to win on both fronts in the coming years. So that's where our confidence comes from.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Sasan, I wanted to ask about the restructuring, which I know you take very seriously. We appreciate it wasn't motivated by cost savings, but rather to better position the company ahead. How are you thinking about reinvesting any savings as it takes time to staff back up to prior levels? Are there specific initiatives that dollars get allocated to? Any additional color would be great. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure, Brad. First of all, I just want to start with acknowledging we are a culture about talent and people and compassion and care. And this is a very, very tough decision. And we took great care of our teams internally, both those that are staying and getting them excited about why we're doing this and what's in the future and they remain extremely energized. But secondarily, taking great care of those that were impacted. And I just wanted to start there because these things are hard for us. We take it very seriously. We also believe that it's critically important to position the company for the future. And as we communicated, which is really the plan that we're executing against and a lot of what my upfront comments were, we are really taking all of the dollars and reinvesting it in five areas, which I articulated earlier in my prepared remarks. And really, our intent is to put all of those dollars back in the five areas that we've seen a lot of green shoots in this past several years. They accelerated towards really the latter part of last fiscal year, which is hence the decision to really double down in those five areas. So our intent is to allocate all of those dollars to those five areas. And of course, it's spread across marketing, customer success and additional headcount, engineering headcount in the areas that I mentioned. And we expect -- by the way, there's no expectation of any of these paying off in the coming year. None of our guidance that we provided resides on the added headcount back in. This is really positioning us for the next two, three years plus. That's an important note for all of you know because there's really no risk to our execution plan as we think about the coming year, but really this is about positioning us in the future. I'll just end with the following: we have a lot of confidence with the margin expansion that Sandeep articulated, and not only from the platform leverage that we're getting, but from all of our AI investments internally to drive a lot of efficiency and productivity.\nSandeep Aujla: Brad, the only thing I would add is we didn't have a standing start as we made that announcement. We were already contemplating as you probably saw from our open job listings, those had increased over the last quarter. We started building out our mid-market go-to-market function as well as scaling our marketing activities, particularly as we go after the assisted tax category, which has a different marketing timing than the DIY category.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks, Sandeep. Look forward to seeing you guys at Investor Day.\nSandeep Aujla: Thank you. We do this. We look forward to it as well.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Brent Thill at Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Sasan, when you think about the Mailchimp reacceleration, what do you need to put in place to enable that to get to the level you'd like to see?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. There are really three areas that we've been executing that are worth calling out that we're excited about. One is the integration with the QuickBooks platform. As I mentioned earlier, one of the biggest areas why we're able to accelerate our customer growth with U.S. QBO, customer growth of 11%, the QBO advanced to 28% is really creating a suite where our platform is all in one place. So that's one area that we are aggressively focused on data and tech integration. And of course, workflow integration, and we're making great progress on that front. That's number one. Number two is mid-market. That is an area where it was critical when we declared the acquisition of Mailchimp, we're building momentum. Both, by the way, what we're doing to integrate the offering, but also our go-to-market capabilities. As we announced, I think, last quarter, Greg Johnson is now back with Intuit. He runs all of our go-to-market for all of small business, and we've brought together our sales and marketing and customer success across Mailchimp and QuickBooks to be able to be better positioned for mid-market. And then last is international. Those are the three areas that we're very focused on. And when we look at our KPIs, we're making solid progress against those three areas, and that's one of the reasons why it leaves us excited about the coming year and the future.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the questions and congratulations on a really solid quarter. I wanted to ask about the acceleration in QBO into Q1. We've seen two quarters of deceleration in both QuickBooks online subscriptions and the online services. The confidence in the acceleration, is that based upon like price increases? Or is there something you're seeing in units or other parts of the business that are giving you guys confidence in guiding towards an acceleration for Q1? And then as a follow-up, talked a lot about where the reinvestment of the dollars or the heads from the headcount reduction came from. Can you give us a little bit of visibility of where those heads came out of? Like what are the parts of the business that you guys are paring back investment in?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Great. Thank you for your question, Keith. I'll start with your first question. Really, our acceleration comes from three areas. One, acceleration in services. And this is services across payments, across payroll, across our live platform and what we expect in Mailchimp. So that's one key area. The second key area is mid-market, where as we shared earlier, we've seen very good traction with QBO events, and we really continue to build out our go-to-market efforts on our platform capabilities. And that's informing by the way, what we're seeing in Q1, but also the fact that we shared earlier that we expect our online ecosystem revenue to be 20%, which is what it was this past year. And the third is price. Those three have played a big role in our acceleration. And the thing I would just call out on price, everything that we really learn and hear from our customers is because we have a business suite in one place, they're actually saving time they need less labor. They're able to drive customer growth based on our capabilities and better manage their cash flow because we're digitizing their cash flow. And that plays a very big role in terms of just the pricing power that we have, especially in our higher-end SKUs. But those are the three things that give us confidence into Q1 and beyond. And as you know, the majority of this business is subscription-based. So it's very predictable. In terms of the -- your second question around, well, where did the heads coming from in terms of the restructuring, there was really several key areas. I would say the largest area as we looked across the company and we looked at talent that we felt there was an opportunity for better performance. This was about 8% of our talent. These are, by the way, very talented folks that will lend great opportunities elsewhere. But it was across the company. It was not from any particular area, which, by the way, why there's really no execution risk from the actions that we took because this wasn't from one area. This was from across the company and talent that was we believe we have an opportunity to upgrade talent. So that was really one area. The second is, we really consolidated some of our technology talent across multiple sites, closing down Boise and Edmonton and consolidating technology talent in our key areas, Tel Aviv, Bangalore, Atlanta and Toronto. But those, I would say, were the main drivers of where the restructuring came from. And then, of course, we're allocating all of it to the 5 areas that I mentioned earlier.\nSandeep Aujla: The only thing I would add, Keith, to Sasan's first part of that question. If you recall in my prepared remarks, I talked about QBO U.S. growing 11%, advance growing 28%. These larger customers tend to adopt and use services at a higher rate than the self-employed that decline, so that's an important attribute to keep in mind. And secondly, on pricing, we look at pricing very carefully, our price volume mix and well over half of our growth comes from volume and mix. And at the company level, the contributions for price are relatively consistent year-over-year while they are slightly higher in the Small Business group. So that's the second component to keep into mind as we look at the trajectory heading into Q1.\nKeith Weiss: Super helpful. Thank you guys.\nSandeep Aujla: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much, team here. A nice finish to the fiscal year and quite positive on the guidance too. One, I couldn't help but notice that your Small Business, the Self-Employed Group is now running at the rate of $10 billion, I think, as of this most recent quarter, 10-ish. Very few companies in software -- in the enterprise software market hit the $10 billion. And congrats, you are there, you've done it with finance accounting for the most part you got payments and payroll. So this puts you on track with ServiceNow, I believe also tendering at a run rate business growing a little bit faster and you're moving upmarket, your SKU mix is decidedly more advanced and less so of lower-value units. So this has been, at least from my perspective, more successful, your tendering dollars and revenue, one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. So haven't come this far, where else could you go with this business? And I'm glad I'm not asking your tax question. Thank you so much\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you for the question, Kash. And also, by the way, the setup, as you saw in our guide we're guiding our Global Business Solutions Group to be north of $11 billion, growing 16% to 17% in the coming year, and particularly with online growing at 20%. And I would just tell you all of that has been done without really much, I would say, massive contribution from mid-market. So the best is yet to come because we are going to continue and if you look at where we are today versus three years ago, we truly have a business suite where we have all of the key capabilities for a business to be able to grow and run their business. And we've been investing in the last five years to be positioned to go after mid-market. And our ultimate goal is to have all of the big brand names, be on our mid-market platform, and we will announce something I think you'll find exciting at our Investor Day that really positions us to be able to serve these larger customers. And that's really when you look at the future -- when we look at the future, where we get really excited is that we're actually at where we are with an incredible franchise without really having a significant contribution from mid-market. And that's what excites us about the future because we want to continue to serve smaller businesses, but we now have a real opportunity to win in mid-market. And I would remind us of the following. It's probably the most important point that I'll make. Mid-market, when it comes to financial management platforms is actually not a crowded space. And so we have an incredible right to win. And this is really precisely what we hear from accountants and from mid-market businesses. We're really excited about the next chapter of taking our business group from we're $10 billion today to much larger as we look into the next three to five years.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, Sir. $10 onto $20. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, indeed. See you at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks. I\u2019ll echo my congrats on the quarter and upbeat guidance in the next year. I guess, Sasan, my question comes around sort of the Global Business Solutions Group. How are you thinking about Intuit Assist impact on that in the coming year. Where is that sort of in the integration process? I'd just be curious about how you see that empowering your customers, maybe growing, helping in areas like mid-market or attach rates on some of your other products in that area. So why don't you just answer that, discuss Intuit Assist on the small business side.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Kirk, thank you for the question. First of all, let me just start with we haven't accounted for or assumed anything in our guidance or around Intuit Assist for the coming year. So I just wanted to start there. Now let me get to your question. We actually have an incredible amount of momentum with Intuit Assist, you're going to see it at Investor Day. But let me start with the foundation of what I shared in the prepared remarks, which was we have about 1 million businesses that are engaging with Intuit Assist. And it is going to play a significant role in the future because that is actually the foundation of what we bet the company on six years ago, which was really around data and AI. But really the bet was about delivering experiences where we do the work for our customers. And so a number of areas that our customers are using today as part of the million that I mentioned is along the lines of marketing campaigns with proposed revenue that our customers could garner that we could then execute on the behalf of our customers. Things like taking, by the way, pictures of an estimate that you may have written on the go then you can take a picture of them, we will create a digitized estimate, invoice your payment schedule that you want, all within the platform. Send it to your customer, remind you in the business feed of, in essence, invoices that are overdue, capital that we can give you access to. And that's what I just mentioned are elements of what some of our customers are using today. And so we're really right now focused on sort of money in, money out because those are the most critical areas for our customers. And if I just take a step forward, ultimately, our entire goal because of our advantage, which is data and AI. Our goal is that we do all of the work for our customers. These examples I just illustrated is all on that path. Now what it means for us as a company beyond the -- of course, the benefit of helping drive revenue growth and profitability growth for businesses. What it means for us is, we believe it will have an impact in a couple of areas. One, new customer growth; particularly the smaller customers; but then two, adoption of our services because the examples I just mentioned, take a picture of a scribble note, upload a PDF file will create estimates invoicing progress payments that all turns into revenue for us. And that, by the way, doesn't even touch on the fact that embedded in our platform going forward is going to be AI-powered live expertise, which is a monetizable event ultimately with the goal of we do everything for you and with you. And so it will be an enormous sort of part of our experience and growth in the future. And we're making really good progress. All of which, by the way, will also show all of you at Investor Day. And I'll end with where I started. None of this is contemplated in our guidance, but it's a big part of our future, and we're excited about it.\nKirk Materne: Super. Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Kartik Mehta at Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Good evening, Sansa and Sandeep. Just a question on tax. Sasan, it seems as though you're executing on the live products, you're starting to execute on the full service. I'm just wondering what was the thought of maybe lowering guidance now, considering the momentum you're building in the business?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would start with -- it's actually one platform, and that's the power of our scale. Customers, ultimately, can do it themselves, they can do it with assistance or we'll do it for customers. And it's all on TurboTax platform and our experts, our virtual experts all sit on the same platform, except they're on the other side of the platform, which is leveraging the customers' data and AI capabilities to do their taxes for them or with them. So I just wanted to start with that foundational point that it's not a lot of different products. It's actually one platform, which is what gives us the scale that we're looking for. When we make decisions around long-term expectations, we don't make them lightly. In fact, I think it was 5.5 years ago, right when I became CEO, we had updated the long-term expectations of tax. And so we take these decisions very seriously. And really what -- and so it's something we've been thinking about for some time. And really, it comes down to a very a simple math equation. When you look at the TAM, which is $35 billion, $5 billion do it yourself and $30 billion assisted both consumer and business, that's where the largest growth opportunity is. That's where we're really growing high-double-digits, 17% with customers growing 11%. And it's 30% of the franchise today, and we are also being very aggressive with DIY, both complex higher-income customers. But based on some green shoots that we saw this year, we're also going to be very assertive with lower income folks that are in the do-it-yourself category. And in that context, we just felt like the time was right to not only guide prudently for the coming year. But also adjust the long-term expectations. And I want to reiterate what you heard from Sandeep it's an interim adjust. And once we get to sustained, growth double-digit, we'll then rethink the long-term guidance. But until then, that's what informed the decision that we made.\nKartik Mehta: And just one follow-up, Sasan, as you look at the health of the Small Business, any change as you look throughout the quarter? Any changes that may be give you concern or hope what's happening to your customers?\nSasan Goodarzi: The headline I would give you, Kartik, is stable. Across our small businesses, we generally, differs by the way, by sector, by state, by country. But at an Uber level, we see revenue and profitability up in this fiscal year for businesses that we serve. We see cash reserves still down 6% to 7% compared to last year, but it's way up compared to pre-pandemic levels. We also see hours worked higher. So headline is stable. And by the way, we see the same thing on the consumer side, which is stable.\nKartik Mehta: Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, very welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. It was great to hear about QBO Live, the number of clients more than tripling. Can you maybe spend a moment talking about what's resonating there? And as you sort of move more into the middle market, what's the opportunity for QBO Live to accelerate that more upmarket push?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me start with your question of what's resonated with the smaller businesses. For us, we've actually had product market fit, meaning that our experts on our platform can really help our businesses with bookkeeping, accounting, providing advice. Really, the biggest challenge that we've been working through in the last year is how to think about the benefit? How to think about the offering? How do we actually go to market because the great news is every business at some point in their life throughout a year, they're engaging a bookkeeper and an accountant. So we're not trying to create opportunity. The opportunity is there. It's just it's manual, it's disaggregated. It's high price. And so really, the biggest thing has been our focus on how do you really help the customer understand that this is now a part of our platform and that we can help them with all the key problems that they have. And I would say that, that's an area where we really uncovered how to do that, and we're accelerating. And I don't want to make you feel like we've reached the destination. I think we still have a lot of work to do in this area. But we\u2019ve really, I would say, cracked a nut that we're excited about, particularly around our decision to embed AI-powered experts into our offering as we look ahead. And lastly, this is a far bigger opportunity with larger customers because they expected. They expect a CFO for a hire and HR for hire. They expect an assistant to be able to help them with their books, with their accounting, with their employee inventory decisions. And so part of what you'll hear us talk about at Investor Day is as we're accelerating our focus with mid-market, with a business suite that has all the key capabilities that a business needs a big element of it is the expertise that it comes with. I think the differentiator for us is these are AI-powered experts that sit on the platform, can really provide a range of services for customers. But we believe it's a bigger opportunity as we move upmarket. And last thing, by the way, I'll end with, these are small sample sizes still. But the -- those that have live experts, the attach and use of services like payments and payroll actually higher, which really is a great benefit for customers and for us.\nDaniel Jester: Great, thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Very welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Arvind Ramnani at Piper Sandler.\nArvind Ramnani: Hi, this is Arvind. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of questions. In some of the prior calls, you have provided some additional color on some of the kind of benefits you're seeing with AI. And given [Technical Difficulty]\nSasan Goodarzi: In and out. We can now, please go ahead and continue.\nArvind Ramnani: Yes. I'm just trying to get some color on your -- some of the impact of AI that you've seen both from a revenue add but also from a cost perspective across your business, is there any additional information you're able to kind of provide in terms of quantification of those benefits you're starting to see?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you for your question. I think a couple of things I would say. First of all, we're seeing the impact of our usage and innovation across all of our platforms. Across Credit Karma, it's really driving a lot of the automation and do it for our customers within TurboTax, even with TurboTax full service, we're doing a lot of the work for experts so that they can serve more customers and, of course, across our business platform that I articulated the examples earlier. So I want to first be clear, this is broad-based across our entire platform. And we are really focused on how AI reimagines our internal work within Intuit as well. I would say the -- really, the revenue is immaterial this year, and we didn't account for anything in the coming year, but we believe it will be a large driver of growth in the future years. And the growth will be really usage of services, better conversion, better retention, and these are the green shoots that we're seeing with, for instance, our million businesses that are using it today. And in terms of our cost structure, remember, data and AI have been core to our investment thesis and our Bets over the last five, six years. And what we do is not capital intensive. At the same time, we're very intentional about the investments that we've had to make and any investments we need to make to win in this world of AI has been contemplated in the guidance that you heard from Sandeep. I don't know, Sandeep, if you add anything?\nSandeep Aujla: No, I think that covers. 1 thing to keep in mind as we compare us to possibly other companies in your portfolio, one point, AI sort of really been in our run rate. So I wouldn't expect any meaningful change in our cost structure. Secondly, we use AWS for a lot of the processing. So it's not like we're building up our own data centers. So that's also very asset light for us. And the other factor, as Sasan alluded to, we are quite frankly also seeing improvements in our own productivity. We are seeing improvements in our developer productivity. We're seeing improvements in our overall G&A productivity. So just factors to keep in mind that AI should not be not getting in the way of our commitment to continue to find operating leverage and continue to scale our margin over time.\nArvind Ramnani: Perfect. And just one quick follow-up. Just on TurboTax Live, as you're thinking of kind of directing questions or your customers to having kind of AI sort of answer it versus QuickBooks Live or sort of the kind of accountant or CPA. Obviously, the AI is going to be like a lower ARPU versus like directing someone who is basically like more like service-oriented. How do you balance that? Because does come at like a higher ARPU, but lower margin. And of course, AI is lower revenue, lower ARPU but higher margins. How do you balance it out?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. I think the premise of what you're articulating is not what we're seeing. We actually believe that based on all of our investments with data and AI, it's actually higher ARPU because it drives better attach of our services. It actually drives more attach of our human-powered expertise. And by the way, when our human-powered experts or AI-powered human experts get involved, they're actually quite effective and productive because they're sitting on our data and AI platform. So we're actually seeing two things. One, higher ARPU over time because of what I articulated, but also more effective and efficiency on our platform because we are as aggressive as we are in applying AI externally we are as aggressive internally based on what you just heard Sandeep talk about. So it's actually the reverse of the premise that you talked about in terms of what we see. I don't know, Sandeep, if you would add anything.\nSandeep Aujla: Yes. The thing to keep in mind is AI is -- the name of the game is confidence and eliminating fear, uncertainty and doubt. And by using AI, by using our AI powered experts, we're actually doing that at scale. And the important thing to keep in mind is it actually helping us open up the aperture of the customers we can serve and really go after penetrating a TAM. That's driving a lot of the success that you've seen in the assisted category. Some of those are fully outsourced to us, some of those that do it with me. So just something to keep in mind as you look at the strategic opportunities that this opens up for us as well.\nArvind Ramnani: That's been really helpful, Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Okay, wonderful. I wanted to ask a question around the platform for AI, the GenOS and the studio that you've outlined in the past, I know it's a little further out to start thinking about separate SKUs, and it sounds like this is more of a conversion and a retention play in the near term. But what were some of the learnings that you had over the course of the year in building out that platform for AI, harnessing the data and some of the platform components that you've outlined at the Analyst Day last year that are underpinning that.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. First of all, let me start with your question around the SKUs. This is a progression, and this is a really important element to call out. What you heard us talk about is that we believe, and we're seeing this in our proof points. And the green shoots that we're seeing is that, one, this will drive new customer growth because we will just make it far easier and simpler for a new customer to use our digital platform that comes with AI-powered experts. Two, we believe that it's an opportunity for the adoption of our services, which also includes Live. Services like payments, payroll, Mailchimp and our live platform, which is our AI-powered human experts. And those are significant customer and growth drivers for us. The progression is as we are focused on the innovation that we articulated earlier, things such as literally a customer being able to take a picture of a scribble note, upload a PDF document for us to be able to put together an estimate all the way to getting them paid following up with their customers, putting marketing campaigns together for them. The progression is we'll get to a place where we'll actually test stand-alone SKUs where the AI agent is doing everything for the customer. And that could be a stand-alone SKU that we could test sometime in the future, but you have to progress your way to that. And that's really what the element of progression talks to. The last thing, which I think was the other element of your question, what we're doing is really hard, which we love because it's hard to replicate. And what's hard about it is, first, you have to have the data. And we have a lot of data. It's our customers' data. But when you look at for every business, we have 500,000 data points. That means we are uniquely positioned to be able to help them with managing their cash flow because it's about their cash flow. It's not about something generic because we see all of their money coming in, money going out, the creditworthiness of their vendors, the employees that they have. And so the investments that we've made in the data has been more than ever crucial because then it allows us to leverage our GenOS platform, which is our GenAI capabilities and train the Intuit LLM on the customer's data to be able to then deliver the experiences that I was just articulating and our LLMS have agency and authority to be able to use other LLMs that could enhance the experience. So the biggest thing that we've learned to sort of punchline answer your question is the combination of the data investments, the investments we've made in knowledge engineering, machine learning and our LLM that really delivers accuracy performance cost effectively is extremely hard to copy because we live in a world of financial management, and that's really our biggest advantage going forward and really our biggest growth opportunity as we look ahead.\nBrad Sills: That's exciting. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions this afternoon. At this time, Mr. Goodarzi, I'd like to turn things back to you for any closing comments, sir.\nSasan Goodarzi: Well, listen, everybody, thank you for your time. Thank you for all of your questions, and we hope to see all of you at Investor Day. Be safe. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude Intuit's Fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 conference call. Again, thanks so much for joining us, everyone. We wish you all a great evening. Good-bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sandeep Aujla",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. We delivered very strong results in fiscal 2024 across the company, including total revenue growth of 13%, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 40 and 100 basis points, respectively, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 24% and 18%, respectively. Our fourth quarter results include: Revenue of $3.2 billion, up 17%. GAAP operating loss of $151 million, versus GAAP operating income of $17 million last year, reflecting a restructuring charge of $223 million recognized in the quarter related to the organizational changes we announced in July. Non-GAAP operating income of $730 million, versus $627 million last year, up 16%. GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.07, versus diluted earnings per share of $0.32 a year ago, also reflecting the restructuring charge. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99, versus $1.65 last year, up 21%. Turning to the business segments: In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, the revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and 19% for the full-year. This momentum demonstrates the power of our small and mid-market business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings as customers look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. Online ecosystem revenue grew 18% during the quarter and 20% for the full-year, driven by our progress serving customers with more complex needs and adoption of our ecosystem of services. As a result, online ecosystem ARPC grew 11% in fiscal 2024. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 17% in Q4 and 19% in fiscal 2024. Growth for the quarter and year was driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. We delivered growth in our declared strategic areas this year, with our emphasis on serving customers with more complex needs. This focus drove U.S. QBO customers excluding self-employed up 11%, QBO Advanced customers up 28%, while QBO self-employed customers declined 14%, resulting in total online paying customers up 6%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 19% in Q4, driven by payments, payroll, capital, and Mailchimp. For the full fiscal year 2024, Online services revenue grew 21%, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp and capital. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher effective prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q4 was 19%, relatively consistent with the range we've seen over the last several quarters. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices, and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth continues to be impacted by the lapping of a larger benefit from price and line-up changes that we made last year in Q2 and Q3. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and line-up. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 11% in Q4 and 13% in fiscal 2024. Turning to desktop. We successfully concluded the three-year transition to a subscription model, which contributed to 25% desktop ecosystem revenue growth in Q4 and 16% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low-30s in Q4, and in the high-teens for fiscal year 2024. Our Q4 desktop ecosystem revenue growth also reflects the offering changes we made in early fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model. These changes resulted in approximately $60 million of desktop revenue recognized in Q4 and approximately $50 million recognized in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, all of which would have otherwise been recognized in Q1 of fiscal 2025. We also expect approximately $50 million of desktop revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in Q1 fiscal 2025 to shift to later quarters in fiscal 2025. In total, these changes lower Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue by approximately $160 million and are largely related to more frequent product updates, beginning in Q4 of fiscal 2024, to align the customer delivery experience to our subscription model. Accordingly, we expect Q1 desktop ecosystem revenue to decline approximately 20% for Q1, but for desktop ecosystem revenue to return to growth in Q2. Overall, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to grow in the low-single-digits in fiscal 2025. Turning to Credit Karme. Credit Karma revenue growth improved each quarter during fiscal 2024, from a 5%, decline in Q1 to 14% growth in Q4. On a product basis in Q4, auto insurance accounted for 6 points of growth, personal loans accounted for 5 points, credit cards accounted for 2 points, and Credit Karma Money accounted for 1 point. Full-year revenue was $1.7 billion, up 5%. We are pleased with the momentum driven by our relentless focus on what matters most to our members and partners. We made strong progress this year redesigning the Credit Karma app to enable members to see much more of their financial life and find the products right for them. We also introduced Intuit Assist to deliver personalized financial insights using data and AI, increased monetization in the underpenetrated Prime segment, and made it easier than ever for consumers to benefit from the Credit Karma and TurboTax product integration. I'm proud of the progress the team made innovating on behalf of our members and partners. Consumer and ProTax Groups. Consumer Group revenue of $4.4 billion grew 7% in fiscal 2024 as we continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. TurboTax Live revenue grew 17%, and customers grew 11%. Full-service customers doubled, while those new to TurboTax tripled. We are pleased with the momentum we saw with TurboTax Live again this season. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $599 million in fiscal 2024, up 7%. In summary, I'm pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $255 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2.0 billion during fiscal 2024. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share, payable on October 18, 2024. This represents a 16% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, our fiscal 2025 guidance includes: Total company revenue of $18.16 billion to $18.347 billion, growth of 12% to 13%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, including online ecosystem revenue growth of approximately 20% and desktop ecosystem revenue growth in the low-single-digits. Our guidance also includes revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and 5% to 8% for Credit Karma. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $12.34 to $12.54, growth of 18% to 20%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $19.16 to $19.36, growth of 13% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2025. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $24 million restructuring charge related to the reorganization we announced in July. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 includes: Total company revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including: Small Business and Self-Employed group revenue growth of 6% to 7%, reflecting the revenue shift in Q1 resulting from the desktop offering changes that I noted earlier. We expect desktop ecosystem revenue to decline approximately 20% in Q1, and the online ecosystem, which is our growth catalyst, to accelerate to approximately 19% growth in Q1. For Credit Karma, we expect revenue to grow in Q1. And for Consumer Group and ProTax revenue to decline in Q1, as we are lapping the period a year ago that included the extended California tax filing deadline. GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.66, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.33 to $2.38. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $19 million restructuring charge that we expect to incur in Q1 related to the reorganization we announced in July. You can find our full fiscal 2025 and Q1 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. I will now shift to our long-term growth expectations for each of our business segments. First, small business. With the momentum we see in online ecosystem growth, we are reiterating our long-term revenue growth expectations for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group of 15% to 20%. As part of this, we continue to expect online paying ARPC growth of 10% to 20%, and we now expect online paying customer growth of 5% to 10%. This reflects our shift in emphasis towards ARPC as we scale mid-market, drive growth in services, and reshape how we go-to-market as one business platform to significantly increase adoption of all our offerings. While there are relatively fewer mid-market customers, the ARPC of mid-market QuickBooks Online customers is nearly 3 times higher than other QuickBooks Online customers. Turning to Credit Karma, we are excited about the opportunity ahead as we execute our strategy to more deeply penetrate our core verticals, scale in growth verticals and execute our consumer ecosystem strategy. With the learnings from operating in the current business cycle, we are updating our long-term revenue growth expectations to 10% to 15%, reflecting the current size and scale of the business, and as we focus on creating seamless, end-to-end experiences with TurboTax that benefit consumers from year-round. Finally, the Consumer Group. Based on the momentum we saw this season, and the significant runway we have ahead to penetrate our TAM, we expect assisted penetration to be the key driver of future growth. TurboTax Live revenue accounted for approximately 30% of Consumer Group revenue in fiscal 2024, and we expect it to become the majority of Consumer Group revenue in the coming years. With that context, while we are scaling assisted, we are adjusting the Consumer Group long-term revenue growth rate to 6% to 10% in this interim period, with TurboTax Live revenue expected to grow 15% to 20%. One final note before I wrap up. Starting in Q1, we will be changing the name of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group to Global Business Solutions Group. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, and our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Brad, the only thing I would add is we didn't have a standing start as we made that announcement. We were already contemplating as you probably saw from our open job listings, those had increased over the last quarter. We started building out our mid-market go-to-market function as well as scaling our marketing activities, particularly as we go after the assisted tax category, which has a different marketing timing than the DIY category. Thank you. We do this. We look forward to it as well. The only thing I would add, Keith, to Sasan's first part of that question. If you recall in my prepared remarks, I talked about QBO U.S. growing 11%, advance growing 28%. These larger customers tend to adopt and use services at a higher rate than the self-employed that decline, so that's an important attribute to keep in mind. And secondly, on pricing, we look at pricing very carefully, our price volume mix and well over half of our growth comes from volume and mix. And at the company level, the contributions for price are relatively consistent year-over-year while they are slightly higher in the Small Business group. So that's the second component to keep into mind as we look at the trajectory heading into Q1. Thank you. No, I think that covers. 1 thing to keep in mind as we compare us to possibly other companies in your portfolio, one point, AI sort of really been in our run rate. So I wouldn't expect any meaningful change in our cost structure. Secondly, we use AWS for a lot of the processing. So it's not like we're building up our own data centers. So that's also very asset light for us. And the other factor, as Sasan alluded to, we are quite frankly also seeing improvements in our own productivity. We are seeing improvements in our developer productivity. We're seeing improvements in our overall G&A productivity. So just factors to keep in mind that AI should not be not getting in the way of our commitment to continue to find operating leverage and continue to scale our margin over time. Yes. The thing to keep in mind is AI is -- the name of the game is confidence and eliminating fear, uncertainty and doubt. And by using AI, by using our AI powered experts, we're actually doing that at scale. And the important thing to keep in mind is it actually helping us open up the aperture of the customers we can serve and really go after penetrating a TAM. That's driving a lot of the success that you've seen in the assisted category. Some of those are fully outsourced to us, some of those that do it with me. So just something to keep in mind as you look at the strategic opportunities that this opens up for us as well."

            "content": "Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We delivered very strong results for the fourth quarter and full-year, and made meaningful progress with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and Big Bets that position the company for durable growth in the future. Our full-year revenue grew 13% and we delivered strong operating margin expansion demonstrating the strength and momentum of our investments and innovation. As we exit the year, we are confident in delivering another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2025. Intuit is the global AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. Our strategy and five Big Bets position Intuit as a mission critical platform that delivers end-to-end solutions, driving sustained growth. We made an early bet on AI. We have a significant advantage with the scale of our data, investments in AI capabilities such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, and GenAI, and our large network of AI-powered virtual experts. This is enabling us to disrupt the categories in which we operate. We are transforming how we serve our customers by delivering done-for-you experiences, where we do the hard work for them, connecting them with AI-powered human expertise to fuel their success. With the introduction of GenAI, we are now delivering reimagined customer experiences and bolstering businesses' growth potential, while driving efficiencies in how work gets done within Intuit. This has enabled us to build our large AI-driven expert platform to fuel the success of consumers, small and mid-market businesses. The progress we've made has bolstered our confidence, leading us to accelerate investments in five key areas within our Big Bets to deliver greater impact in the future. I'll spend a moment unpacking the progress we've made and our investment plans for the future: First, within Big Bet 1, we are delivering done-for-you experiences with Intuit Assist. In fiscal year 2024, we made strong progress making Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistant, available to millions of consumers and approximately 1 million small and mid-market businesses. We are accelerating our investments to rollout Intuit Assist at scale in the coming year. Second, within Big Bet 2, we are accelerating platform and go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI-powered experts across our business offerings. In fiscal year 2024, TurboTax Live revenue grew 17%, and full-service customers doubled while those new to TurboTax tripled. QuickBooks Live customers more than tripled. We expect our accelerated investment in these areas to deepen our penetration in very manual, high-priced, and dis-aggregated assisted categories. By digitizing how services are delivered, an integral part of our done-for-you platform experiences, we will become the AI-powered financial assistant for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. Next, within Big Bet 4, our money solutions, we are making additional investments to accelerate digitizing the experience end-to-end for consumers, small and mid-market businesses, from estimate, to invoicing, to getting paid and paying bills. In fiscal year 2024, the total online payment volume we facilitated on our platform grew 20%. We also helped small businesses access $2.4 billion in financing through QuickBooks Capital, up 28%, and we made significant progress digitizing B2B payments with our bill pay offering, for which monthly payment volume processed quadrupled over the last six months. In fiscal year 2025, we expect these accelerated investments to deliver best-in-class, seamless payments, capital, banking, bill pay, and invoicing solutions. Next, within Big Bet 5, we are doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in the platform and go-to-market motions. In fiscal year 2024, QBO Advanced customers grew 28%. In fiscal year 2025, we are accelerating investments to better serve customers who have more complex needs, such as more sophisticated accounting and reporting requirements, business intelligence, money solutions, human capital management, professional services, and customer acquisition solutions with Mailchimp, all assisted by AI-powered human experts. And finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks. We've translated the Mailchimp offering into five different languages for markets where we see a large TAM. Looking ahead, we are bringing QuickBooks and Mailchimp together to create a single growth platform, differentiated in the markets where we have product market fit, including in Canada, U.K., and Australia. In other geographies, we are leading with Mailchimp's strong international footprint to help small businesses get customers as we continue to localize the offering. Wrapping up, with the progress and momentum we are delivering, and the accelerated investment areas I've shared, we are in a great position to win as an end-to-end platform with experiences that fuel the success of customers. Intuit is the AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. With that -- now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Thanks Sandeep. We are confident in our long term growth strategy, including double-digit revenue growth and operating income growing faster than revenue. We have the strategy to win given the green shoots we're observing, and with less than 5% penetration of our $300 billion in TAM, with a massive runway ahead. We look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day next month, where we'll unpack all of this and more. Let's now open it up to your questions. Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. First of all, I want to start with our focus will continue to be Small Businesses that are formed and because we want to fundamentally continue to grow with them. With that as context, we've just simply doubled down on our focus on mid-market. And as you know, it's not new. This has been five years in the making. It's one of the five Bets that we declared more than five years ago. But I would just say, five years later, Siti, we are just building an incredible amount of momentum. With that as context, let me just now answer your question. One, the way to think about it is we now have a business suite. And our business suite provides all the capabilities to -- for our business to be able to grow their customers, manage their customers, be able to manage their cash flow, get their accounting done, all in 1 place. And with our really AI-powered innovation and AI-powered experts, we really have tilted the professional grade help and services to all of our businesses. And we are now at a place where we are really accelerating on two fronts. One, we are going to go to market as one platform versus pieces and parts to really accelerate services penetration because of the one thing we continue to hear from businesses is that they want to do everything in one place and now we have the business suite for them to do everything in one place. Secondarily is our acceleration in mid-market. We're actually excited to announce at Investor Day a platform that will take us even further up market, and that really positions us to not only grow with our customers but to really acquire new customers. I would just remind us that the majority of mid-market customers are nonconsumption. And they pay a lot of money to use multiple different apps, discrete apps that don't talk to each other. Excel spreadsheets, Google Sheets, shoe boxes, and paying for multiple different bookkeepers, marketing agents and ultimately, accountants. And now we have packaged all of that as one enterprise suite to be able to pursue and accelerate pursuing mid-market customers. And our ultimate goal is to go far beyond 10 to 100 employees. And so I think this is five years in the making. And to round out the answer to your question, this is both focusing on the smaller customers, but we're really doubling down on the larger customers and really being able to penetrate services. And that's really what gives us confidence in the 20% online ecosystem revenue growth at a far bigger scale that you heard from Sandeep, along with our acceleration in Q1. Thank you for your question. Yes, absolutely, Alex. Thank you for your question. Let me start with the last part of your question, which is around the macro environment. We have not assumed anything other than the current environment. We're not assuming any tailwinds coming from the macro environment. So that's really been one of the elements that's informed our guidance. It's really about our current trends that we're seeing our current momentum that we're seeing and really all focused on our own execution. So that's really the first part of your question. I would say the second part is just as a refresher, the total tax market is about $35 billion in TAM, $5 billion of that is do-it-yourself and about $30 billion is both -- is all assisted, but consumer and on the business side. We've got great momentum. As you know, TurboTax Live grew 17% this past year, but the number of full-service customers that we got double, new to the franchise tripled. And so we have a lot of momentum as we look ahead, and that's why we have a lot of confidence in really providing an expectation that we expect TurboTax Live to grow between 15% to 20%. And that really leads to -- we wanted to just adjust our long-term expectations to be really prudent because until TurboTax Live, which today is 30% of our franchise, growing high-double-digits, until that becomes a larger part of our franchise, we wanted to be prudent with our long-term expectation. I will just end with saying that DIY is actually very important, and I would parse it into two. One, we're actually growing quite rapidly, and I would say, high-single-digits with complex customers with higher income, and we're actually accelerating taking share. And based on our learnings this year and based on our trade-offs that we made this year and our focus this year, we're going to be quite assertive in continuing to pursue lower income customers this year because we have a lot of green shoots from this past year with our experiments of how to deliver benefits and monetize beyond tax with our Credit Karma platform. And so we're going to be leaning into that. And I'll just end with the final aspect of the question that you asked, really are upside to our guide, which is, I think, a question you asked around TurboTax comes from really two dimensions. One, accelerating in assisted tax beyond the 15% to 20%; and two, actually accelerating where we've seen a lot of green shoots, which is the more complex, higher income customers that are DIY. We have positioned ourselves for the innovation and the lineup that's required to win on both fronts in the coming years. So that's where our confidence comes from. Yes. Thank you, Alex. Yes, sure, Brad. First of all, I just want to start with acknowledging we are a culture about talent and people and compassion and care. And this is a very, very tough decision. And we took great care of our teams internally, both those that are staying and getting them excited about why we're doing this and what's in the future and they remain extremely energized. But secondarily, taking great care of those that were impacted. And I just wanted to start there because these things are hard for us. We take it very seriously. We also believe that it's critically important to position the company for the future. And as we communicated, which is really the plan that we're executing against and a lot of what my upfront comments were, we are really taking all of the dollars and reinvesting it in five areas, which I articulated earlier in my prepared remarks. And really, our intent is to put all of those dollars back in the five areas that we've seen a lot of green shoots in this past several years. They accelerated towards really the latter part of last fiscal year, which is hence the decision to really double down in those five areas. So our intent is to allocate all of those dollars to those five areas. And of course, it's spread across marketing, customer success and additional headcount, engineering headcount in the areas that I mentioned. And we expect -- by the way, there's no expectation of any of these paying off in the coming year. None of our guidance that we provided resides on the added headcount back in. This is really positioning us for the next two, three years plus. That's an important note for all of you know because there's really no risk to our execution plan as we think about the coming year, but really this is about positioning us in the future. I'll just end with the following: we have a lot of confidence with the margin expansion that Sandeep articulated, and not only from the platform leverage that we're getting, but from all of our AI investments internally to drive a lot of efficiency and productivity. Yes. There are really three areas that we've been executing that are worth calling out that we're excited about. One is the integration with the QuickBooks platform. As I mentioned earlier, one of the biggest areas why we're able to accelerate our customer growth with U.S. QBO, customer growth of 11%, the QBO advanced to 28% is really creating a suite where our platform is all in one place. So that's one area that we are aggressively focused on data and tech integration. And of course, workflow integration, and we're making great progress on that front. That's number one. Number two is mid-market. That is an area where it was critical when we declared the acquisition of Mailchimp, we're building momentum. Both, by the way, what we're doing to integrate the offering, but also our go-to-market capabilities. As we announced, I think, last quarter, Greg Johnson is now back with Intuit. He runs all of our go-to-market for all of small business, and we've brought together our sales and marketing and customer success across Mailchimp and QuickBooks to be able to be better positioned for mid-market. And then last is international. Those are the three areas that we're very focused on. And when we look at our KPIs, we're making solid progress against those three areas, and that's one of the reasons why it leaves us excited about the coming year and the future. Yes. Great. Thank you for your question, Keith. I'll start with your first question. Really, our acceleration comes from three areas. One, acceleration in services. And this is services across payments, across payroll, across our live platform and what we expect in Mailchimp. So that's one key area. The second key area is mid-market, where as we shared earlier, we've seen very good traction with QBO events, and we really continue to build out our go-to-market efforts on our platform capabilities. And that's informing by the way, what we're seeing in Q1, but also the fact that we shared earlier that we expect our online ecosystem revenue to be 20%, which is what it was this past year. And the third is price. Those three have played a big role in our acceleration. And the thing I would just call out on price, everything that we really learn and hear from our customers is because we have a business suite in one place, they're actually saving time they need less labor. They're able to drive customer growth based on our capabilities and better manage their cash flow because we're digitizing their cash flow. And that plays a very big role in terms of just the pricing power that we have, especially in our higher-end SKUs. But those are the three things that give us confidence into Q1 and beyond. And as you know, the majority of this business is subscription-based. So it's very predictable. In terms of the -- your second question around, well, where did the heads coming from in terms of the restructuring, there was really several key areas. I would say the largest area as we looked across the company and we looked at talent that we felt there was an opportunity for better performance. This was about 8% of our talent. These are, by the way, very talented folks that will lend great opportunities elsewhere. But it was across the company. It was not from any particular area, which, by the way, why there's really no execution risk from the actions that we took because this wasn't from one area. This was from across the company and talent that was we believe we have an opportunity to upgrade talent. So that was really one area. The second is, we really consolidated some of our technology talent across multiple sites, closing down Boise and Edmonton and consolidating technology talent in our key areas, Tel Aviv, Bangalore, Atlanta and Toronto. But those, I would say, were the main drivers of where the restructuring came from. And then, of course, we're allocating all of it to the 5 areas that I mentioned earlier. Thank you for the question, Kash. And also, by the way, the setup, as you saw in our guide we're guiding our Global Business Solutions Group to be north of $11 billion, growing 16% to 17% in the coming year, and particularly with online growing at 20%. And I would just tell you all of that has been done without really much, I would say, massive contribution from mid-market. So the best is yet to come because we are going to continue and if you look at where we are today versus three years ago, we truly have a business suite where we have all of the key capabilities for a business to be able to grow and run their business. And we've been investing in the last five years to be positioned to go after mid-market. And our ultimate goal is to have all of the big brand names, be on our mid-market platform, and we will announce something I think you'll find exciting at our Investor Day that really positions us to be able to serve these larger customers. And that's really when you look at the future -- when we look at the future, where we get really excited is that we're actually at where we are with an incredible franchise without really having a significant contribution from mid-market. And that's what excites us about the future because we want to continue to serve smaller businesses, but we now have a real opportunity to win in mid-market. And I would remind us of the following. It's probably the most important point that I'll make. Mid-market, when it comes to financial management platforms is actually not a crowded space. And so we have an incredible right to win. And this is really precisely what we hear from accountants and from mid-market businesses. We're really excited about the next chapter of taking our business group from we're $10 billion today to much larger as we look into the next three to five years. Yes, indeed. See you at Investor Day. Yes, Kirk, thank you for the question. First of all, let me just start with we haven't accounted for or assumed anything in our guidance or around Intuit Assist for the coming year. So I just wanted to start there. Now let me get to your question. We actually have an incredible amount of momentum with Intuit Assist, you're going to see it at Investor Day. But let me start with the foundation of what I shared in the prepared remarks, which was we have about 1 million businesses that are engaging with Intuit Assist. And it is going to play a significant role in the future because that is actually the foundation of what we bet the company on six years ago, which was really around data and AI. But really the bet was about delivering experiences where we do the work for our customers. And so a number of areas that our customers are using today as part of the million that I mentioned is along the lines of marketing campaigns with proposed revenue that our customers could garner that we could then execute on the behalf of our customers. Things like taking, by the way, pictures of an estimate that you may have written on the go then you can take a picture of them, we will create a digitized estimate, invoice your payment schedule that you want, all within the platform. Send it to your customer, remind you in the business feed of, in essence, invoices that are overdue, capital that we can give you access to. And that's what I just mentioned are elements of what some of our customers are using today. And so we're really right now focused on sort of money in, money out because those are the most critical areas for our customers. And if I just take a step forward, ultimately, our entire goal because of our advantage, which is data and AI. Our goal is that we do all of the work for our customers. These examples I just illustrated is all on that path. Now what it means for us as a company beyond the -- of course, the benefit of helping drive revenue growth and profitability growth for businesses. What it means for us is, we believe it will have an impact in a couple of areas. One, new customer growth; particularly the smaller customers; but then two, adoption of our services because the examples I just mentioned, take a picture of a scribble note, upload a PDF file will create estimates invoicing progress payments that all turns into revenue for us. And that, by the way, doesn't even touch on the fact that embedded in our platform going forward is going to be AI-powered live expertise, which is a monetizable event ultimately with the goal of we do everything for you and with you. And so it will be an enormous sort of part of our experience and growth in the future. And we're making really good progress. All of which, by the way, will also show all of you at Investor Day. And I'll end with where I started. None of this is contemplated in our guidance, but it's a big part of our future, and we're excited about it. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would start with -- it's actually one platform, and that's the power of our scale. Customers, ultimately, can do it themselves, they can do it with assistance or we'll do it for customers. And it's all on TurboTax platform and our experts, our virtual experts all sit on the same platform, except they're on the other side of the platform, which is leveraging the customers' data and AI capabilities to do their taxes for them or with them. So I just wanted to start with that foundational point that it's not a lot of different products. It's actually one platform, which is what gives us the scale that we're looking for. When we make decisions around long-term expectations, we don't make them lightly. In fact, I think it was 5.5 years ago, right when I became CEO, we had updated the long-term expectations of tax. And so we take these decisions very seriously. And really what -- and so it's something we've been thinking about for some time. And really, it comes down to a very a simple math equation. When you look at the TAM, which is $35 billion, $5 billion do it yourself and $30 billion assisted both consumer and business, that's where the largest growth opportunity is. That's where we're really growing high-double-digits, 17% with customers growing 11%. And it's 30% of the franchise today, and we are also being very aggressive with DIY, both complex higher-income customers. But based on some green shoots that we saw this year, we're also going to be very assertive with lower income folks that are in the do-it-yourself category. And in that context, we just felt like the time was right to not only guide prudently for the coming year. But also adjust the long-term expectations. And I want to reiterate what you heard from Sandeep it's an interim adjust. And once we get to sustained, growth double-digit, we'll then rethink the long-term guidance. But until then, that's what informed the decision that we made. The headline I would give you, Kartik, is stable. Across our small businesses, we generally, differs by the way, by sector, by state, by country. But at an Uber level, we see revenue and profitability up in this fiscal year for businesses that we serve. We see cash reserves still down 6% to 7% compared to last year, but it's way up compared to pre-pandemic levels. We also see hours worked higher. So headline is stable. And by the way, we see the same thing on the consumer side, which is stable. Yes, very welcome. Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me start with your question of what's resonated with the smaller businesses. For us, we've actually had product market fit, meaning that our experts on our platform can really help our businesses with bookkeeping, accounting, providing advice. Really, the biggest challenge that we've been working through in the last year is how to think about the benefit? How to think about the offering? How do we actually go to market because the great news is every business at some point in their life throughout a year, they're engaging a bookkeeper and an accountant. So we're not trying to create opportunity. The opportunity is there. It's just it's manual, it's disaggregated. It's high price. And so really, the biggest thing has been our focus on how do you really help the customer understand that this is now a part of our platform and that we can help them with all the key problems that they have. And I would say that, that's an area where we really uncovered how to do that, and we're accelerating. And I don't want to make you feel like we've reached the destination. I think we still have a lot of work to do in this area. But we've really, I would say, cracked a nut that we're excited about, particularly around our decision to embed AI-powered experts into our offering as we look ahead. And lastly, this is a far bigger opportunity with larger customers because they expected. They expect a CFO for a hire and HR for hire. They expect an assistant to be able to help them with their books, with their accounting, with their employee inventory decisions. And so part of what you'll hear us talk about at Investor Day is as we're accelerating our focus with mid-market, with a business suite that has all the key capabilities that a business needs a big element of it is the expertise that it comes with. I think the differentiator for us is these are AI-powered experts that sit on the platform, can really provide a range of services for customers. But we believe it's a bigger opportunity as we move upmarket. And last thing, by the way, I'll end with, these are small sample sizes still. But the -- those that have live experts, the attach and use of services like payments and payroll actually higher, which really is a great benefit for customers and for us. Yes. Very welcome. In and out. We can now, please go ahead and continue. Yes. Thank you for your question. I think a couple of things I would say. First of all, we're seeing the impact of our usage and innovation across all of our platforms. Across Credit Karma, it's really driving a lot of the automation and do it for our customers within TurboTax, even with TurboTax full service, we're doing a lot of the work for experts so that they can serve more customers and, of course, across our business platform that I articulated the examples earlier. So I want to first be clear, this is broad-based across our entire platform. And we are really focused on how AI reimagines our internal work within Intuit as well. I would say the -- really, the revenue is immaterial this year, and we didn't account for anything in the coming year, but we believe it will be a large driver of growth in the future years. And the growth will be really usage of services, better conversion, better retention, and these are the green shoots that we're seeing with, for instance, our million businesses that are using it today. And in terms of our cost structure, remember, data and AI have been core to our investment thesis and our Bets over the last five, six years. And what we do is not capital intensive. At the same time, we're very intentional about the investments that we've had to make and any investments we need to make to win in this world of AI has been contemplated in the guidance that you heard from Sandeep. I don't know, Sandeep, if you add anything? Yes. I think the premise of what you're articulating is not what we're seeing. We actually believe that based on all of our investments with data and AI, it's actually higher ARPU because it drives better attach of our services. It actually drives more attach of our human-powered expertise. And by the way, when our human-powered experts or AI-powered human experts get involved, they're actually quite effective and productive because they're sitting on our data and AI platform. So we're actually seeing two things. One, higher ARPU over time because of what I articulated, but also more effective and efficiency on our platform because we are as aggressive as we are in applying AI externally we are as aggressive internally based on what you just heard Sandeep talk about. So it's actually the reverse of the premise that you talked about in terms of what we see. I don't know, Sandeep, if you would add anything. Thank you. Sure. First of all, let me start with your question around the SKUs. This is a progression, and this is a really important element to call out. What you heard us talk about is that we believe, and we're seeing this in our proof points. And the green shoots that we're seeing is that, one, this will drive new customer growth because we will just make it far easier and simpler for a new customer to use our digital platform that comes with AI-powered experts. Two, we believe that it's an opportunity for the adoption of our services, which also includes Live. Services like payments, payroll, Mailchimp and our live platform, which is our AI-powered human experts. And those are significant customer and growth drivers for us. The progression is as we are focused on the innovation that we articulated earlier, things such as literally a customer being able to take a picture of a scribble note, upload a PDF document for us to be able to put together an estimate all the way to getting them paid following up with their customers, putting marketing campaigns together for them. The progression is we'll get to a place where we'll actually test stand-alone SKUs where the AI agent is doing everything for the customer. And that could be a stand-alone SKU that we could test sometime in the future, but you have to progress your way to that. And that's really what the element of progression talks to. The last thing, which I think was the other element of your question, what we're doing is really hard, which we love because it's hard to replicate. And what's hard about it is, first, you have to have the data. And we have a lot of data. It's our customers' data. But when you look at for every business, we have 500,000 data points. That means we are uniquely positioned to be able to help them with managing their cash flow because it's about their cash flow. It's not about something generic because we see all of their money coming in, money going out, the creditworthiness of their vendors, the employees that they have. And so the investments that we've made in the data has been more than ever crucial because then it allows us to leverage our GenOS platform, which is our GenAI capabilities and train the Intuit LLM on the customer's data to be able to then deliver the experiences that I was just articulating and our LLMS have agency and authority to be able to use other LLMs that could enhance the experience. So the biggest thing that we've learned to sort of punchline answer your question is the combination of the data investments, the investments we've made in knowledge engineering, machine learning and our LLM that really delivers accuracy performance cost effectively is extremely hard to copy because we live in a world of financial management, and that's really our biggest advantage going forward and really our biggest growth opportunity as we look ahead. Yes, thank you. Well, listen, everybody, thank you for your time. Thank you for all of your questions, and we hope to see all of you at Investor Day. Be safe. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations.\nKim Watkins: Thanks, David. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward- looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter with solid momentum across the company as we executed our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Third quarter revenue grew 12%. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% despite an uncertain macro environment, demonstrating the importance of our platform in fueling success for small businesses and our momentum serving the mid-market. Consumer Group revenue grew 9%, and Credit Karma revenue grew 8%, driven by the impact of innovation for members and the benefits of TurboTax and Credit Karma product integration. I\u2019m proud of our performance, and the momentum we are seeing across the company. Turning to tax. We continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM in the US. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories. We are well positioned to penetrate the assisted TAM by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform. Let me share several proof points. This season we made good progress against our multi-year strategy to transform the assisted experience for customers. TurboTax Live, our assisted offering, including our do-it-with-me and full service tax offerings for both consumers and businesses is our largest durable growth opportunity. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and revenue to grow 17% in fiscal 2024. TurboTax Live revenue is expected to be $1.4 billion, representing approximately 30% of total Consumer Group revenue growing at a significant scale. This gives us confidence that we can digitize a very manual, disaggregated, and high priced assisted category. Now let me spend a few minutes going deeper in several areas. First, TurboTax Live full service is resonating with consumers as we continue to innovate, making it simpler for customers to get their taxes done virtually. We expect TurboTax Live full service customers to double this fiscal year, with those new to TurboTax to triple. Our full service offering has a product recommendation score of 85, one of the highest at Intuit. Our learnings and insights from this season bolster our confidence in the continued opportunity we have to disrupt the assisted tax category. Second, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax segment and higher value customers over the pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. Third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, played a big role in our TurboTax experience this year. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of done for you, where the hard work is done automagically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. More than 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to explain their refund, answer questions, and help deliver confidence that their return was completed accurately this year. This is data and GenAI working at scale, for both our customers and our AI powered experts helping customers virtually. I\u2019m excited about what we are working on for next season to accelerate innovation and deliver even more customer benefits. And fourth, we delivered solid results with the product integration across Credit Karma and TurboTax. We grew the number of customers that filed with TurboTax from the embedded Credit Karma experience by 76%, and tax refunds deposited in a Credit Karma Money account by 28%. We also delivered strong growth in Credit Karma Money revenue this quarter. This product integration also drove new members to Credit Karma, consistent with our goal of driving higher engagement and monetization for Credit Karma over time. Given these results, we see big opportunities ahead to deliver on our vision to help consumers make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save more, pay off debt, and take steps to improve their financial health. To significantly accelerate creating seamless, end-to-end consumer experiences that customers benefit from year-round, we are more closely aligning TurboTax and Credit Karma under Mark Notarainni, General Manager of the Consumer Group, who will oversee both segments. I\u2019m excited to share that Joe Kauffman, currently President of Credit Karma and part of the leadership team for the last nine years, will be leading Credit Karma as of August 1, reporting to Mark. Additionally, Ken Lin will retire from Intuit around the end of this calendar year. I can\u2019t thank Ken enough for his friendship, leadership, and impact across Intuit. In summary, we made strong progress this tax season that sets us up for continued success in the future. Now, let\u2019s take a look ahead. The era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime. It is reinventing customer experiences, creating new monetization possibilities, and structurally changing how we work within Intuit to deliver for customers. We are very well positioned to take advantage of this era with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets that pursue the largest customer problems and growth drivers for Intuit. As part of our financial planning process, we have identified key areas within our Big Bets where we plan to accelerate investments to deliver greater impact. These include: Big Bet 1 GenAI to deliver done- for-you experiences with Intuit Assist, Big Bet 2 go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI powered experts across our small business offerings, Big Bet 4, our money solutions, to digitize the experience end-to-end for consumers and small businesses, from estimate, to invoicing, to getting paid and paying bills, Big Bet 5, doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in the platform and go-to-market motions; and finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks. To increase our investments in the outlined focus areas given the green shoots we are observing, we are taking a hard look at what work we can stop doing and where we can reallocate investments, to accelerate top line growth while remaining committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Wrapping up, we are excited about the opportunity ahead, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep.\nSandeep Aujla: Thanks, Sasan. We delivered a solid third quarter of fiscal 2024 across the company. Our third quarter results include, revenue of $6.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $3.1 billion, versus $2.8 billion last year, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating income of $3.7 billion, versus $3.4 billion last year, up 11%%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.42, versus $7.38 a year ago, up 14%. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.88, versus $8.92 last year, up 11%. Now turning to the business segments. Consumer group revenue of $3.7 billion grew 9% in Q3, reflecting the progress we made transforming the assisted experience for consumers and small businesses this season. Our strategy is working. We expect TurboTax Live revenue to grow 17% to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024, representing approximately 30% of overall Consumer Group revenue, driving total average revenue per return up approximately 10%. I\u2019m pleased with the sustained growth we\u2019re seeing in our TurboTax Live business. Overall retention is expected to be up 3 points year-over-year in fiscal 2024, close to pre-COVID levels, demonstrating the strength of our offerings and highlighting the benefits we are delivering to our customers. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax and higher ARPR customers over the pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. As a result, we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and total online paying units to grow approximately 2% in fiscal 2024, versus total IRS returns growth of 1%. Due to yielding share with pay-nothing and lower ARPR customers, we expect our share of total consumer returns to decline approximately 80 basis points this year, and total TurboTax units to decline 1%. We are raising our full year Consumer Group revenue growth guidance to $4.440 billion to $4.455 billion, which is at the top end of our previously provided guidance. I\u2019m proud of the progress we made this season, and the learnings we had reinforce our confidence in the future. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long-term given the size and trajectory of TurboTax Live. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect ProTax Group revenue growth of 6% to 7%. Turning to the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. The revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue which grew 19%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q3, driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. As I shared last quarter, we continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market, through continued focus on both go-to-market motions and product innovations. Mid-market customers drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services on our platform, although they are a smaller subset of the total customer TAM. This, coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem offerings to existing customers, shifts the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q3, driven by payments, payroll, and Mailchimp. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher effective prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q3 was 22%. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices, and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth in Mailchimp decelerated this quarter, as we were lapping a larger benefit from price and line-up changes that we made last year. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and line-up. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Shifting to the Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high-teens. At the end of this fiscal year, we will complete the three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. As I shared last quarter, starting next fiscal year, we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue, to grow in the high-single digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining Desktop Plus subscription customers, who tend to be more complex and higher value, to migrate seamlessly to either QBO or our Desktop Enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains our growth catalyst longer-term. As a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 18%, up from the prior guidance of 16% to 17%. We continue to expect Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 15% to 20% long-term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $443 million in Q3, up 8%. On a product basis, Credit Karma Money accounted for 3 points of growth, credit cards and auto insurance each accounted for 2 points, and personal loans accounted for 1 point. We saw strength in Credit Karma Money from TurboTax customers choosing to deposit their refund in a Credit Karma Money account, and we are seeing a return to growth in the insurance segment. However, the overall picture remains mixed, reflecting uncertain macro trends as we continued to see select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q3. We are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a growth of 2%, versus our prior guidance range of plus or minus 3% growth. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $584 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on July 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes, total company revenue growth of 13%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 21% to 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 18% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 16%, up from prior guidance of 12% to [16%] (ph) growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 28% to 29%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 15% growth; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 17%, up from prior guidance of 12% to 14% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 includes, revenue growth of 13% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.30, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Finally, as Sasan shared earlier, we have made strong progress on our five Big Bets and see opportunities to invest further in select focus areas to accelerate our pace of progress and deliver greater impact. Therefore, as part of our annual financial planning process, we are taking a hard look at reallocating investments. We remain committed to our financial principles, growing revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster -- slower than revenue, leading to expanding operating margin in fiscal 2025 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Sandeep. Let me close with three points. First, we're very well positioned to take advantage of the largest technological shifts of our era given Intuit strategy and five Big Bets with AI at the center as all we do. Second, given the green shoots we're observing, we are doubling down in key areas of our bets to accelerate growth. Third, we continue to recruit great technical and leadership talent across the company to accelerate our progress. In that context, I'd like to share that Greg Johnson recently returned as Executive Vice President, Intuit, Chief Commercial Officer and Global Small Business & Self-Employed Group Chief Revenue Officer. Greg is a world-class leader with nearly 10 years of experience at Intuit, leading TurboTax as the Head of Marketing and then as General Manager. I'm thrilled to have Greg back in Intuit. Now let's open it up to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And a really nice quarter in that, you guys really flexed the ability to use the portfolio to outperform on the top line and outperform on the bottom line. And in what has been a pretty difficult earnings season actually taking earnings up we hear your full year EPS is coming off. So that's all great to see. I wanted to ask about the tax business overall. The shift towards kind of the high end, the higher ARPC customers seems more pronounced this year probably than what I was expecting, and I think most people were expecting. I think the underlying question most investors have is like, why can\u2019t we do both right? Why can\u2019t we price for the low end and get those customers on board as well as attracting those higher ARPC customers? Is that available to you? Or do you need to be shifting more upmarket?\nSasan Goodarzi: Hey, Keith, thank you very much for the complement and your question. Let me address your question in a couple of ways. First of all, I'll start with some of what we already shared, but it's important context in that we're really bullish in terms of what we saw with TurboTax Live going after the assisted segment because now you have a $1.4 billion business growing at 17%. And with that being 30% of the total TurboTax franchise, when we flip that over to, now it becomes 50%, 60% of the franchise, it really accelerates the growth of the entire TurboTax franchise. And what we demonstrated this year, I would almost say for the first time is, we moved the needle of taking share and assisted. When you look at the fact that -- although IRS grew 1%, most of that growth all happened in DIY, mainly with sort of three simple filer customers, assisted was flat, and that's where we took share. And I think that is a first sort of time of a sign that we're starting to build a flywheel effect that gives us a lot of confidence as we look into the future. I think the second thing that I would say is we -- because of our Credit Karma and TurboTax platform, we actually see the customers that are just really looking for a free tax software and are bouncing between platforms, and we are not interested in those customers. We're not interested in pursuing those customers, the cost of acquisition to get those customers when they simply are bouncing between platforms. We're really focused on quality of the customers, particularly because now we've just scratched the service in the assisted segment and what really matters is now accelerating the share take in the assisted segment. So that's really how we're thinking about it and what gives us confidence in not only what we delivered, but particularly in the future.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks so much guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDaniel Jester: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just actually want to expand on the comments you've made on. So on one hand, you talked about focusing more on sort of the higher end of the market, but you're also talking about deepening the integration between Credit Karma and TurboTax in the future. And so can you just maybe expand a little bit more, especially around the Credit Karma and TurboTax integration, what we should be expecting going forward? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, absolutely. This year, particularly, we're very excited about what we saw and actually what didn't work. And let me, if I could, hit on both. First and foremost, Credit Karma has over 40 million monthly active users and a larger chunk of those 40 million plus active users are actually doing their taxes using the assisted method. And so that's an enormous opportunity for us. This year, we embedded the TurboTax experience within Credit Karma, and we're very aggressive pursuing those customers. And in fact, we drove traffic north of $10 million within Credit Karma, those that were interested in doing their taxes with TurboTax. That's why it resulted in a 76% growth of the number of TurboTax customers that use the embedded experience within Credit Karma. At the same time, what we are constructively dissatisfied are two very basic things that did not work well this year. One with seamless log in, the second was performance of the app. And what I mean by seamless log in is, out of those 10 million-plus customers that were in the bucket of traffic, about 25% of them when they click to start doing their taxes with us or have us do it for them, they didn't have any instruction. They could just get started right away, where 75% of them could not. There was a lot of friction. And that was just an element of time. We were not able to get to all the work that was required to get everyone to experience, in essence, no log in. And that's a big deal, and we're all over it already. The second is performance of the app. We worked very hard to embed the TurboTax experience within Credit Karma, but the performance of the app was not where it needs to be. When I say performance of the app, some of the time that it took was like eight to seven seconds just for the app to be able to load. That's unacceptable, and we saw a lot of drop off. Both of those are in our control. Both of those, we are already working on. But I share that as an example of -- we saw a huge green shoot with our focus this year on every Credit Karma member becoming a TurboTax customer. And there's two very basic things that we're constructively dissatisfied with that gives us actually a lot of confidence as we look into the future. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nDaniel Jester: That\u2019s great. Thanks for the context.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. And Sasan, I want to ask about your vision and strategy for the Money platform. I have a multipart question there. We have seen you expanded invoice to bill pay. Would love to get your progress so far, any feedback there in the last couple of quarters. But also, we saw that you recently acquired Proper Finance and also made some hiring -- senior executive hiring in the money platform side. So I'd love to hear your strategy in which direction it's going in a money platform.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure, Siti, thank you for the question. Let me actually talk about the focus around money on two dimensions that we're very, very excited about. And as you also heard in our prepared remarks, this is an area where we are accelerating our investments. We are seeing a lot of green shoots with all the work that we've been doing in the last several years, really digitizing the whole process of estimating invoicing to getting paid and having multiple paying options along with the bill pay capabilities that we've built that we are now rolling out to our customers. We're seeing a lot of green shoots in both of those areas. You saw in a pretty tough macro environment. Our payments overall total payments volume was up 22%, and that's an area where we're accelerating our investment. That's on the small business side. The thing that we're also excited about is money focused across the TurboTax Credit Karma platform. We saw a lot of green shoots this year with a 20% or 28% increase of the number of customers that put their refund on a Credit Karma Money account. We're excited about it, not because of the 28%. We actually believe that could be far bigger. But because of the areas of friction that we are going to remove and the fact that we have opportunities to give much earlier access to their tax refund and actually monetize it. So those are the two areas across our small business and consumer platform that we are focused on and we're accelerating our investments across both of those platforms in the coming year.\nSandeep Aujla: And Siti on the acquisition, you mentioned, as we've shared with you in the past, we are continually looking at by the partner, and that was a small technology tuck-in that we did to build some of the core money movement and risk management capabilities within our small business group.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Markgraff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAlex Markgraff: Great. Thank you for taking my questions, Sasan. Just one for you on TurboTax. Just looking at recent Investor Day slides and sort of the long-term growth framework for the business. When we look at this total TurboTax share of IRS returns, I think implies sort of a positive share gain over the long term. And I'm just curious, I understand the focus in the assisted category. Should we be thinking about that input differently as it relates to total IRS returns going forward, just given what we're seeing at the lower end of the spectrum?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Alex, great question. Let me just -- one minute of context, and then I'll answer your question. Based on our estimates, we believe the IRS total returns will grow about 1%. And the majority of that, if not all of that will happen in the do-it-yourself category. The assisted category is generally flat, which is why we led with the fact that we are taking share. With that as context, it actually does not change our long-term goal post of we want to be able to increase share of total IRS returns. We also want to get there in the right way. So this year, I'm very comfortable with where we ended up because our entire focus was the assisted segment and high value, high average revenue per return filers. But over time, as TurboTax Live goes from being 30% of our franchise, growing at 17% to being 70% of our franchise. So that's when you're going to see us start moving the needle on increasing our share of the total IRS returns. And by the way, I would also liken this, although it's not directly at your question, I would liken this to the online desktop mix, if you think about the last five to 10 years in small business. We always said that once online becomes more than 50% of small business and then 60% and 70% over time because it's growing faster, it will actually accelerate the growth rate of the small business group. That is exactly what's happened. And we believe that same thing will happen in TurboTax as TurboTax Live goes from 30% to 70% one day, and that's what will result in our total share increasing of total IRS.\nAlex Markgraff: Okay. Thank you.\nSandeep Aujla: One other point of context, if I may add, Alex, that's important to understand that even on the simple filers, there is a customer segmentation that is critical for us to keep in mind. We are -- we remain focused on the simple filers through both TurboTax and Credit Karma, but we are not focused on are the simple filers that have a higher propensity to change platforms year after year because we frankly don't think those -- that's a good return on our investment, and there's no opportunity for us to grow and earn revenue there. So I just want to make sure that customer segmentation was also pronounced in what you were hearing.\nAlex Markgraff: Understood. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yeah, thanks very much. Sasan, can you just touch upon Mailchimp a little bit? I was kind of curious what your thought is for the business into the back half of the year, given the fact that I think some people think on the small business side, cutting back on sort of go-to-market is often a place they might look to trim. Can you just talk about sort of what you're seeing there? And what gives you confidence that perhaps this is an opportunity for you guys to take share in that area? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Great question. First of all, I'll reiterate what you heard from us earlier. The fact that the revenue decelerated was primarily because we're lapping a big price increase and some lineup changes from last year. The fundamental health of the business is consistent with what it was last quarter. So that's number one. Number two, our durable focus remains the same, which is -- we are integrating Mailchimp and QuickBooks. I'd be happy to talk about that more, if there are questions about it, two, mid-market, third, international. And we're being really very aggressive in international. In fact, I was just most recently in London, spent time with our new leader in Mailchimp that leads EMEA, that came from another company where he has built a really a large international business, and two, visited a number of customers and partners, and we're being very aggressive with our approach in what we've done with the platform, what we're doing with our pricing and then the marketing investments that we are making as we look ahead. And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, there are five areas where we are accelerating our investment. This is one of them. And so we're quite excited about the possibilities given the green shoots that we're seeing.\nKirk Materne: Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Sasan, you still remain the best predictor of small business. You've got the best read. And I'm curious what -- you said green shoots, I speak by that observation. And in a macro environment, which gets tougher, you guys have shown the ability to execute really well. So what are the other things in your toolkit that you have been able to unpack that if the macro environment continues to stay where it is? One of the things that could help them to continue to outperform these expectations for the small business segment. Thank you so much and congrats.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, and great to hear from you. The -- one of our fundamental execution philosophies that we have at the company is conviction on the long-term, ambitious testing and experimentation in the short term so that we can be nimble, we can learn and we can adjust. And really, the answer to your question is the five areas that you heard that we're accelerating our investments. I mean we are seeing green shoots with our learnings and insights with Intuit Assist, and we're accelerating our investments in GenAI. We -- as I talked about earlier, for the first time, we were increasing our share in the assisted segment. And so we're accelerating a number of areas with TurboTax Live. We are also embedding an expert within QuickBooks Live, within our entire small business platform where every offering will actually come with an embedded expert because we believe, based on green shoots that we've seen, that will improve conversion, it will also improve retention. And mid-market, I mean, we have been really assertive in building out capabilities in the platform. We have been asserted in building out our customer-facing capabilities from leadership all the way down to our frontline sales folks, and we're seeing great green shoots there to accelerate not only growing with our customers, but I'm hunting for new ones. And as you know, mid-market is not just about getting the customers, it's all the services that comes with the it, payments, payroll, live platform capability. So, Kash, those are the, I would say, key green shoots that we are seeing, all of which we are accelerating our investments currently, by the way, in the quarter and as we head into next year.\nKash Rangan: Fantastic. Thanks. Glad to hear that.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Tanks very much. Sasan, as you sort of think about the overall economic environment, you did a great job there with Kash's question. But for the first time, I think, as long as you provided the data, payroll wasn't the number one growth driver on the online ecosystem. So maybe you can dig in there and give us a little sort of color on what's going on within the payroll business and if we should expect growth to continue to moderate there. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Well, let me start actually with the -- what we're seeing on our platform with respect to the health of small businesses, if I could just do that for a moment. One of the things that we are seeing, if we look back from today versus the last three to four months, we're actually seeing some improvement in profitability of small businesses on our platform. And that's a good sign compared to the last couple of years. Now within that, the -- depending on the sector that you're in, your performance is driven by the environment. And so for instance, manufacturing -- areas like manufacturing, professional services, auto repair, their profits are actually up nearly 20%, where real estate lending, their profits are actually down 15%. So the net of it is overall, we've seen improvement, depending on the sector you're in, your performance varies. But the net of all of that is that cash reserves are down 8% compared to this time last year, but up over 16% compared to pre-COVID. So what you should take away is small businesses are healthier but their cash reserves have been impacted. And for those that are on our platform, by the way, over four years, their cash reserves are over 60% higher than those that have only been with us for a year. Last thing I would just say is hours worked is actually up compared to the last quarter. Specific to your payroll question, let me ask Sandeep to answer specifically what you asked about payroll.\nSandeep Aujla: Brad, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to see customers in our payroll business, adopting our solutions. They continue to take our higher-end offerings as well. The reason for the difference you called out is, I'll point to the payments business where the charge volume went to 22% growth in the quarter versus 20% the prior quarter. So that's the key item to call out in that sequencing.\nBrad Reback: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question. Sasan, it's great to hear about the strong performance in full service this season. Can you double-click into which assisted filers, you feel you did a good job capturing, which might have been a little bit more resistant than your expectations? And how do you think about driving momentum in full service going forward?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Brad, great question. I was actually in San Diego all day yesterday with the TurboTax team doing deep dives on all of these durable priorities. One of them was full service. First of all, I would tell you that across all of the states, across different income levels, across all complexities, very consistent. And I would say that if you heard -- not if you heard, if you reflect back on what I said in the remarks, that our new customers in full service tripled, an outsized element of that was those that are sort of younger, the millennials, and they are actually embracing full service as a cohort more than others, not by an incredible amount, but it stands out for us. So I think what we learned -- and that's a big deal by the way. What we learned is, we were successful just in one area. But I'll tell you the biggest area we are constructively dissatisfied when you look at our overall assisted performance. We were very aggressive with our go-to-market and not just spend but the beginnings of being able to recommend an expert, the beginnings of when you search for a local expert us showing up. There's a lot of infrastructure that we built. We drive a lot of traffic to our front doors. Where we are constructively dissatisfied is, we have to work on our shopping experience. When you walk into somebody's firm, a store or somebody's home to have them do your taxes for you, you're not presented with a set of SKUs. You just go in there and you exchange documents and they do their taxes for you. Our shopping experience has to be improved. That's where we saw the biggest drop off. So what we have a lot of confidence in is the demand that we created. And by the way, the performance. But the demand that we created was exceptional. We need to get better at the shopping experience. It's one of the areas where -- by the way we saw this during the season, and there's a lot of work that's being done to actually leverage AI to personalize the experiences so that when we get a customer that comes in, that comes from an assisted method, they're actually greeted by an expert versus greeted with which SKU do you want to pick.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much for the color, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Enders: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe I just want to start on -- or want to ask about the AI and the assistant or the AI Intuit Assist solution that's now out of market. I guess -- what are kind of the proof points that you've seen? Or how is it kind of manifesting in kind of improving experience or driving monetizable outcomes for Intuit so far?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Steve, thank you for the question. I'm actually pleased with our progress, and I'll share some of the proof points, and I will also just remind us, we're still in the early days, but a lot has changed in the last three months. So let me share what those are. First of all, in TurboTax, 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to better understand the refund outcome and be able to get their questions answered. And not just the customer but Intuit Assist help our experts be much more efficient and effective in helping our customers. And as you can imagine, we would not have rolled that out to 24 million folks if that wasn't accretive to conversion. The second is Credit Karma. In Credit Karma, we have over 40 million monthly active users, and we have rolled out Intuit Assist capabilities, and I'll share what those are in a moment, to nearly half of our 40 million monthly active users. And what we have rolled out are the following things: one, to help you make a decision. And so by the way, if any of you on the call are Credit Karma users, and you happen to have iOS, unless you are in a holdout cell, you'll be able to see everything that I am articulating. So you will see things like Intuit Assist that we'll show you see why, see comparisons, let me help you. And when you engage, it helps you actually understand and have a conversation about which card is right for you. In the past, we always were able to use your data to deliver personalized experiences for you. In this case, personalized cards that are right for you, but now we can have a conversation with you and help you understand why one is better than the other. That's one huge element. The other is help you make financial decisions, help you understand how to build your credit, help you understand how to better save money, help you understand which cards are best to use and which cards you should reduce your utilization. That's what we've rolled out. And again, as you can imagine, we would not have rolled that out to almost 20 million Credit Karma members if it wasn't accretive to better monetization. And then the last couple of examples that I would use is on the small business side, where Mailchimp, nearly 300,000 customers have Intuit Assist available to them, particularly and specifically around personalized marketing campaigns, where you can -- where we help you put a campaign together, images, text, et cetera. And in -- across the QuickBooks platform, we have capabilities available to nearly 30,000-ish customers. And the capability is really about turning unstructured data into money and personalized feed. What that means is taking your e-mail as an example, and taking everything that's in your e-mail and turning it into an invoice that's paid and labeled so that you can get paid faster, and that's a monetizable event for us. And then business feeds that helps you orient to what's most important insight for the day, which ultimately depending on what you engage with is a monetizable event for us. So we've made a lot of progress in the last 90 days. And we're even more hopeful about what's possible in the future. I'll just end with -- it's early days, but it's amazing the progress that the team has made in the last 90 days.\nSteve Enders: Great to hear. Thanks for the context there.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around TurboTax Full Service. I know it's been a couple of seasons now under your belt here. What are some of the areas that you've learned from? What are some of the areas you've outperformed with full service. What are some of the learnings from a couple of tax seasons now under your belt? And what have you identified for the future in order to target that segment more aggressively? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Brad, thank you for your question. First of all, I would say, this actually was the first real season with full service. Last year, it was still -- although we rolled that out, it was still at the experiment level. With that said, to answer your question, a couple of things. One, because we were quite aggressive with our go-to-market, we learned that we can create a lot of demand. And we created a lot of demand not only by talking about the fact that we can do your taxes in less than a day, we can help extend your money and give you early access or immediate access to your money. But there is a lack of price transparency in the entire assisted segment, where you don't really know what you're going to pay until you walk into somebody's store or a firm. And we did a lot of testing to understand how important price is. We learned that it matters a lot. And so we created a lot of demand. That's number one. Number two, when you search locally for an expert or -- and/or if we showed you in when you engage with full services, there's an expert near you, the conversion rates were significantly higher than when we didn't so up in search. And that, by the way, is just an element of time. We'll be able to get all of what we were doing this year rolled out across all of our customers. But that's an enormous learning that local matters. People want to be able to search for pro-near-me, folks want to know that their expert is nearby, and we saw a significant expert or conversion lift. Last thing that we saw as a great proof point is, I think this was more towards the middle, towards the end of season, you could recommend your expert. That had a big conversion one. But we were not able to scale that for the entire season or to all of our customers, which we plan to do next year. So those are the big insights and the big learnings. And last, I'll just end with the following, which is what I mentioned a moment ago, we have a lot of work to do on our shopping experience. And to simply put it, when you walk into somebody's firm or a store, you're not presented with a SKU in a lineup. You just walk in and get -- have them get your taxes done. And that's what we are working on, which is, in essence, when you pick full service, you're greeted by the expert versus a pricing lineup to make a choice. And that with an enormous learning this year, all of which we're currently working on for next year that give us a lot of confidence.\nBrad Sills: Very clear. Thanks, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Sasan, this is primarily on TurboTax and on do-it-yourself in TurboTax. I think, I heard Sandeep say that overall consumer retention or TurboTax retention was 3 points yet there was some share loss, obviously, on the low end and seemingly in do-it-yourself. The full service metrics and overall TurboTax Live sound great. So I think you have good retention there, good new customer acquisition. But in the do-it-yourself in the paid customer, are you doing okay in share there? And what are you doing in that category specifically paid, do-it-yourself to build-share going forward. Because when you answered Alex's question earlier about growing share, it sounds like all like in the assisted category, and that's great. It's a great opportunity. Just curious, in the paid categories, what your opportunities are going forward? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for the question. And Sandeep, please feel fear to build. I would say that overall, we feel good about our paid share because if you -- and we cut it multiple different ways internally. But if you look at what we've shared in our remarks, total IRS grew 1%. Our total paying customers grew 2%, and our retention grew 3 points. So we actually feel good about our paying share. I think what you heard us remark on is, where we lost share, which we're okay with because it was actually an intentional focus on the things that we've talked about today, was on customers that are, in essence, simple filers that are bouncing between platforms. And that's the area where we articulated earlier that we lost share. So that's the way I would have you think about our performance is when it comes to paying share, we actually feel good about our performance.\nSandeep Aujla: Scott, I would also add that you should have not take away that we are yielding any ground on the paying of DIY customers. Our marketing investments, we are focused on attracting both customers to our platform. Our experiences are helping those customers better understand their returns and gain better confidence leading to better conversion. And we remain relentlessly focused on improving our product experience for those customers. So in addition to the assisted category, which we are excited to disrupt the $31 billion market across consumer and small business, we also are focused on taking share. It was a paying DIY customer.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thank you both.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome, Scott.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Sasan, you talked earlier in the prepared remarks about desktop and the changes here in the coming year. Can you kind of link that up maybe a little bit is what we've seen in QuickBooks Advanced? And how -- if there's kind of more opportunity to bring desktop guys over and what you're seeing here on board?\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Let me -- thank you for the question. And let me answer your question, but if I'm not answering your question directly, please come at me again. I think what you heard us talk about earlier is, one, we've been in the middle of a business model shift moving all of our desktop customers to subscription. And at the same time, we've been building capabilities on our online platform. So eventually, all of our desktop customers have a destination, which is online. And we believe, over time, all of our desktop customers at one point will be on our online platform. With that said, the thing that I would say is that we've really built out a lot of our capabilities on QuickBooks Advanced. And in fact, we are aggressively building a number of capabilities that we'll be excited to talk to all of you about at Investor Day, really targeting even larger customers. And I think we'll be far better positioned to take on some of our larger enterprise customers that may choose to want to come to our online platform. And that's really the essence of what we were talking about earlier. As you think about our desktop franchise looking ahead, one, we have desktop enterprise that's growing high single digits. Number two, we view that we can get most of our customers over time to go to our online platform and price to value also plays an important role. And with all that said, I just think we're better positioned for some of our larger customers that come to our QB Advanced over time. And that's what really gives us confidence as we look into the future.\nSandeep Aujla: No, I was just going to add, the question was also about just the progress we are feeling about Advanced. What I would say across the mid-market and as I alluded in my prepared remarks, we continue to feel good about the progress we're making with the mid-market, including with QuickBooks Online Advanced and with the desktop enterprise product, which grew in the in the high teens. So that's an area we continue to feel good about, the add I would have.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Welcome.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Daniela on for Taylor. Thanks for taking my question. So it looks like the Small Business & Self-Employed growth in the quarter was run by stable to our accounting growth and an acceleration in that stock. So as we look into 4Q, how much of the implied 17% for Small Business & Self-Employed growth is being driven by desktop versus stability in the online segment? And given that so many SMB software companies saw incremental pressure in 1Q, can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of SMP Health and how that is influencing your guide? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Let me get us started. Sandeep, please jump in if you have any perspective to add. I'm not sure I understood the premise of your question, so let me just share what you should take away. What you should take away is the strength of our small business franchise is being driven by our online performance. Overall, it grew 18% or our online actually grew 19%, our services grew 20% and we actually feel very good about the trajectory of the business. And as we talked about, as we look ahead, we believe that desktop will continue to grow once the business model shift comes to an end, but that continued growth will come from the fact that half of desktop is enterprise, and it's growing high -- we anticipate it to grow high single digits. But the takeaway should be that in a macro environment, that is somewhat uncertain. Our online performance for small business has been quite strong, very resilient, and we're actually seeing a lot of engagement and usage by our customers just because it's really helping them manage their cash flow. It's helping them grow their business, and I think we're very well positioned in this environment.\nSandeep Aujla: And what I would add, in addition to Sasan's comments about the health of the SMB market is a reminder that 80% of our small business group's revenue is subscription-based. And when you look at those businesses, the part of that is not related to subscription, largely on our services side. Couple of factors just to underline, we saw our payments charge volume increased 22% in Q3, which was faster than what we saw in Q2. And we continue to see good adoption of our payroll offerings by customers as well as a mix shift towards the high end of payroll offerings. So heading into Q4, we feel good about our online ecosystem growth, which remains our growth catalyst going into the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. Appreciate you fitting me on. The small business segment growth is holding in strong if we look at the international online ecosystem revenue growth, trailing at 12% in constant currency. Sasan, are there plays you see to potentially jump-start overseas growth? Is there anything you're experimenting with around Mailchimp that could help with tip of the spear there into broader international reach? Or what else do you see that yield potentially better growth down the line? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with the fact that the Mailchimp lapping price increase from last year and some of the lineup changes that we talked about earlier impacts international growth, just since 50% of Mailchimp's revenue is international. So that was a big driver of why 12%. And two, yes, absolutely, given the green shoots that we are seeing with Mailchimp internationally and where we have product market fit with QuickBooks and Mailchimp, one of the five areas that we are accelerating our investments is, in fact, international. So we're excited about what's possible as we look at.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: I'll now turn the program back to our speakers for any closing remarks. I do apologize. We will actually take our next question. I apologize again. We were going to take our question from Alex Zukin, but they have removed themselves from the queue. I will return the call to our speakers for any closing remarks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Well, listen, everybody, thank you so much for attending. Thank you for your wonderful questions, and we will see you at our next earnings. Be safe. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This does conclude today's progress. Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call.",

            "name": "Sandeep Aujla",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. We delivered a solid third quarter of fiscal 2024 across the company. Our third quarter results include, revenue of $6.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $3.1 billion, versus $2.8 billion last year, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating income of $3.7 billion, versus $3.4 billion last year, up 11%%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.42, versus $7.38 a year ago, up 14%. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.88, versus $8.92 last year, up 11%. Now turning to the business segments. Consumer group revenue of $3.7 billion grew 9% in Q3, reflecting the progress we made transforming the assisted experience for consumers and small businesses this season. Our strategy is working. We expect TurboTax Live revenue to grow 17% to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024, representing approximately 30% of overall Consumer Group revenue, driving total average revenue per return up approximately 10%. I'm pleased with the sustained growth we're seeing in our TurboTax Live business. Overall retention is expected to be up 3 points year-over-year in fiscal 2024, close to pre-COVID levels, demonstrating the strength of our offerings and highlighting the benefits we are delivering to our customers. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax and higher ARPR customers over the pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. As a result, we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and total online paying units to grow approximately 2% in fiscal 2024, versus total IRS returns growth of 1%. Due to yielding share with pay-nothing and lower ARPR customers, we expect our share of total consumer returns to decline approximately 80 basis points this year, and total TurboTax units to decline 1%. We are raising our full year Consumer Group revenue growth guidance to $4.440 billion to $4.455 billion, which is at the top end of our previously provided guidance. I'm proud of the progress we made this season, and the learnings we had reinforce our confidence in the future. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long-term given the size and trajectory of TurboTax Live. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect ProTax Group revenue growth of 6% to 7%. Turning to the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. The revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue which grew 19%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q3, driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. As I shared last quarter, we continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market, through continued focus on both go-to-market motions and product innovations. Mid-market customers drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services on our platform, although they are a smaller subset of the total customer TAM. This, coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem offerings to existing customers, shifts the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q3, driven by payments, payroll, and Mailchimp. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher effective prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q3 was 22%. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices, and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth in Mailchimp decelerated this quarter, as we were lapping a larger benefit from price and line-up changes that we made last year. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and line-up. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Shifting to the Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high-teens. At the end of this fiscal year, we will complete the three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. As I shared last quarter, starting next fiscal year, we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue, to grow in the high-single digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining Desktop Plus subscription customers, who tend to be more complex and higher value, to migrate seamlessly to either QBO or our Desktop Enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains our growth catalyst longer-term. As a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 18%, up from the prior guidance of 16% to 17%. We continue to expect Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 15% to 20% long-term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $443 million in Q3, up 8%. On a product basis, Credit Karma Money accounted for 3 points of growth, credit cards and auto insurance each accounted for 2 points, and personal loans accounted for 1 point. We saw strength in Credit Karma Money from TurboTax customers choosing to deposit their refund in a Credit Karma Money account, and we are seeing a return to growth in the insurance segment. However, the overall picture remains mixed, reflecting uncertain macro trends as we continued to see select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q3. We are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a growth of 2%, versus our prior guidance range of plus or minus 3% growth. In summary, I'm pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $584 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on July 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes, total company revenue growth of 13%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 21% to 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 18% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 16%, up from prior guidance of 12% to [16%] (ph) growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 28% to 29%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 15% growth; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 17%, up from prior guidance of 12% to 14% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 includes, revenue growth of 13% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.30, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Finally, as Sasan shared earlier, we have made strong progress on our five Big Bets and see opportunities to invest further in select focus areas to accelerate our pace of progress and deliver greater impact. Therefore, as part of our annual financial planning process, we are taking a hard look at reallocating investments. We remain committed to our financial principles, growing revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster -- slower than revenue, leading to expanding operating margin in fiscal 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. And Siti on the acquisition, you mentioned, as we've shared with you in the past, we are continually looking at by the partner, and that was a small technology tuck-in that we did to build some of the core money movement and risk management capabilities within our small business group. One other point of context, if I may add, Alex, that's important to understand that even on the simple filers, there is a customer segmentation that is critical for us to keep in mind. We are -- we remain focused on the simple filers through both TurboTax and Credit Karma, but we are not focused on are the simple filers that have a higher propensity to change platforms year after year because we frankly don't think those -- that's a good return on our investment, and there's no opportunity for us to grow and earn revenue there. So I just want to make sure that customer segmentation was also pronounced in what you were hearing. Brad, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to see customers in our payroll business, adopting our solutions. They continue to take our higher-end offerings as well. The reason for the difference you called out is, I'll point to the payments business where the charge volume went to 22% growth in the quarter versus 20% the prior quarter. So that's the key item to call out in that sequencing. Scott, I would also add that you should have not take away that we are yielding any ground on the paying of DIY customers. Our marketing investments, we are focused on attracting both customers to our platform. Our experiences are helping those customers better understand their returns and gain better confidence leading to better conversion. And we remain relentlessly focused on improving our product experience for those customers. So in addition to the assisted category, which we are excited to disrupt the $31 billion market across consumer and small business, we also are focused on taking share. It was a paying DIY customer. No, I was just going to add, the question was also about just the progress we are feeling about Advanced. What I would say across the mid-market and as I alluded in my prepared remarks, we continue to feel good about the progress we're making with the mid-market, including with QuickBooks Online Advanced and with the desktop enterprise product, which grew in the in the high teens. So that's an area we continue to feel good about, the add I would have. And what I would add, in addition to Sasan's comments about the health of the SMB market is a reminder that 80% of our small business group's revenue is subscription-based. And when you look at those businesses, the part of that is not related to subscription, largely on our services side. Couple of factors just to underline, we saw our payments charge volume increased 22% in Q3, which was faster than what we saw in Q2. And we continue to see good adoption of our payroll offerings by customers as well as a mix shift towards the high end of payroll offerings. So heading into Q4, we feel good about our online ecosystem growth, which remains our growth catalyst going into the future."

            "content": "Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter with solid momentum across the company as we executed our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Third quarter revenue grew 12%. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% despite an uncertain macro environment, demonstrating the importance of our platform in fueling success for small businesses and our momentum serving the mid-market. Consumer Group revenue grew 9%, and Credit Karma revenue grew 8%, driven by the impact of innovation for members and the benefits of TurboTax and Credit Karma product integration. I'm proud of our performance, and the momentum we are seeing across the company. Turning to tax. We continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM in the US. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories. We are well positioned to penetrate the assisted TAM by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform. Let me share several proof points. This season we made good progress against our multi-year strategy to transform the assisted experience for customers. TurboTax Live, our assisted offering, including our do-it-with-me and full service tax offerings for both consumers and businesses is our largest durable growth opportunity. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and revenue to grow 17% in fiscal 2024. TurboTax Live revenue is expected to be $1.4 billion, representing approximately 30% of total Consumer Group revenue growing at a significant scale. This gives us confidence that we can digitize a very manual, disaggregated, and high priced assisted category. Now let me spend a few minutes going deeper in several areas. First, TurboTax Live full service is resonating with consumers as we continue to innovate, making it simpler for customers to get their taxes done virtually. We expect TurboTax Live full service customers to double this fiscal year, with those new to TurboTax to triple. Our full service offering has a product recommendation score of 85, one of the highest at Intuit. Our learnings and insights from this season bolster our confidence in the continued opportunity we have to disrupt the assisted tax category. Second, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax segment and higher value customers over the pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. Third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, played a big role in our TurboTax experience this year. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of done for you, where the hard work is done automagically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. More than 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to explain their refund, answer questions, and help deliver confidence that their return was completed accurately this year. This is data and GenAI working at scale, for both our customers and our AI powered experts helping customers virtually. I'm excited about what we are working on for next season to accelerate innovation and deliver even more customer benefits. And fourth, we delivered solid results with the product integration across Credit Karma and TurboTax. We grew the number of customers that filed with TurboTax from the embedded Credit Karma experience by 76%, and tax refunds deposited in a Credit Karma Money account by 28%. We also delivered strong growth in Credit Karma Money revenue this quarter. This product integration also drove new members to Credit Karma, consistent with our goal of driving higher engagement and monetization for Credit Karma over time. Given these results, we see big opportunities ahead to deliver on our vision to help consumers make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save more, pay off debt, and take steps to improve their financial health. To significantly accelerate creating seamless, end-to-end consumer experiences that customers benefit from year-round, we are more closely aligning TurboTax and Credit Karma under Mark Notarainni, General Manager of the Consumer Group, who will oversee both segments. I'm excited to share that Joe Kauffman, currently President of Credit Karma and part of the leadership team for the last nine years, will be leading Credit Karma as of August 1, reporting to Mark. Additionally, Ken Lin will retire from Intuit around the end of this calendar year. I can't thank Ken enough for his friendship, leadership, and impact across Intuit. In summary, we made strong progress this tax season that sets us up for continued success in the future. Now, let's take a look ahead. The era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime. It is reinventing customer experiences, creating new monetization possibilities, and structurally changing how we work within Intuit to deliver for customers. We are very well positioned to take advantage of this era with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets that pursue the largest customer problems and growth drivers for Intuit. As part of our financial planning process, we have identified key areas within our Big Bets where we plan to accelerate investments to deliver greater impact. These include: Big Bet 1 GenAI to deliver done- for-you experiences with Intuit Assist, Big Bet 2 go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI powered experts across our small business offerings, Big Bet 4, our money solutions, to digitize the experience end-to-end for consumers and small businesses, from estimate, to invoicing, to getting paid and paying bills, Big Bet 5, doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in the platform and go-to-market motions; and finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks. To increase our investments in the outlined focus areas given the green shoots we are observing, we are taking a hard look at what work we can stop doing and where we can reallocate investments, to accelerate top line growth while remaining committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Wrapping up, we are excited about the opportunity ahead, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Great. Thank you, Sandeep. Let me close with three points. First, we're very well positioned to take advantage of the largest technological shifts of our era given Intuit strategy and five Big Bets with AI at the center as all we do. Second, given the green shoots we're observing, we are doubling down in key areas of our bets to accelerate growth. Third, we continue to recruit great technical and leadership talent across the company to accelerate our progress. In that context, I'd like to share that Greg Johnson recently returned as Executive Vice President, Intuit, Chief Commercial Officer and Global Small Business & Self-Employed Group Chief Revenue Officer. Greg is a world-class leader with nearly 10 years of experience at Intuit, leading TurboTax as the Head of Marketing and then as General Manager. I'm thrilled to have Greg back in Intuit. Now let's open it up to your questions. Hey, Keith, thank you very much for the complement and your question. Let me address your question in a couple of ways. First of all, I'll start with some of what we already shared, but it's important context in that we're really bullish in terms of what we saw with TurboTax Live going after the assisted segment because now you have a $1.4 billion business growing at 17%. And with that being 30% of the total TurboTax franchise, when we flip that over to, now it becomes 50%, 60% of the franchise, it really accelerates the growth of the entire TurboTax franchise. And what we demonstrated this year, I would almost say for the first time is, we moved the needle of taking share and assisted. When you look at the fact that -- although IRS grew 1%, most of that growth all happened in DIY, mainly with sort of three simple filer customers, assisted was flat, and that's where we took share. And I think that is a first sort of time of a sign that we're starting to build a flywheel effect that gives us a lot of confidence as we look into the future. I think the second thing that I would say is we -- because of our Credit Karma and TurboTax platform, we actually see the customers that are just really looking for a free tax software and are bouncing between platforms, and we are not interested in those customers. We're not interested in pursuing those customers, the cost of acquisition to get those customers when they simply are bouncing between platforms. We're really focused on quality of the customers, particularly because now we've just scratched the service in the assisted segment and what really matters is now accelerating the share take in the assisted segment. So that's really how we're thinking about it and what gives us confidence in not only what we delivered, but particularly in the future. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. This year, particularly, we're very excited about what we saw and actually what didn't work. And let me, if I could, hit on both. First and foremost, Credit Karma has over 40 million monthly active users and a larger chunk of those 40 million plus active users are actually doing their taxes using the assisted method. And so that's an enormous opportunity for us. This year, we embedded the TurboTax experience within Credit Karma, and we're very aggressive pursuing those customers. And in fact, we drove traffic north of $10 million within Credit Karma, those that were interested in doing their taxes with TurboTax. That's why it resulted in a 76% growth of the number of TurboTax customers that use the embedded experience within Credit Karma. At the same time, what we are constructively dissatisfied are two very basic things that did not work well this year. One with seamless log in, the second was performance of the app. And what I mean by seamless log in is, out of those 10 million-plus customers that were in the bucket of traffic, about 25% of them when they click to start doing their taxes with us or have us do it for them, they didn't have any instruction. They could just get started right away, where 75% of them could not. There was a lot of friction. And that was just an element of time. We were not able to get to all the work that was required to get everyone to experience, in essence, no log in. And that's a big deal, and we're all over it already. The second is performance of the app. We worked very hard to embed the TurboTax experience within Credit Karma, but the performance of the app was not where it needs to be. When I say performance of the app, some of the time that it took was like eight to seven seconds just for the app to be able to load. That's unacceptable, and we saw a lot of drop off. Both of those are in our control. Both of those, we are already working on. But I share that as an example of -- we saw a huge green shoot with our focus this year on every Credit Karma member becoming a TurboTax customer. And there's two very basic things that we're constructively dissatisfied with that gives us actually a lot of confidence as we look into the future. So hopefully, that answers your question. Very welcome. Sure, Siti, thank you for the question. Let me actually talk about the focus around money on two dimensions that we're very, very excited about. And as you also heard in our prepared remarks, this is an area where we are accelerating our investments. We are seeing a lot of green shoots with all the work that we've been doing in the last several years, really digitizing the whole process of estimating invoicing to getting paid and having multiple paying options along with the bill pay capabilities that we've built that we are now rolling out to our customers. We're seeing a lot of green shoots in both of those areas. You saw in a pretty tough macro environment. Our payments overall total payments volume was up 22%, and that's an area where we're accelerating our investment. That's on the small business side. The thing that we're also excited about is money focused across the TurboTax Credit Karma platform. We saw a lot of green shoots this year with a 20% or 28% increase of the number of customers that put their refund on a Credit Karma Money account. We're excited about it, not because of the 28%. We actually believe that could be far bigger. But because of the areas of friction that we are going to remove and the fact that we have opportunities to give much earlier access to their tax refund and actually monetize it. So those are the two areas across our small business and consumer platform that we are focused on and we're accelerating our investments across both of those platforms in the coming year. Very welcome. Yeah, Alex, great question. Let me just -- one minute of context, and then I'll answer your question. Based on our estimates, we believe the IRS total returns will grow about 1%. And the majority of that, if not all of that will happen in the do-it-yourself category. The assisted category is generally flat, which is why we led with the fact that we are taking share. With that as context, it actually does not change our long-term goal post of we want to be able to increase share of total IRS returns. We also want to get there in the right way. So this year, I'm very comfortable with where we ended up because our entire focus was the assisted segment and high value, high average revenue per return filers. But over time, as TurboTax Live goes from being 30% of our franchise, growing at 17% to being 70% of our franchise. So that's when you're going to see us start moving the needle on increasing our share of the total IRS returns. And by the way, I would also liken this, although it's not directly at your question, I would liken this to the online desktop mix, if you think about the last five to 10 years in small business. We always said that once online becomes more than 50% of small business and then 60% and 70% over time because it's growing faster, it will actually accelerate the growth rate of the small business group. That is exactly what's happened. And we believe that same thing will happen in TurboTax as TurboTax Live goes from 30% to 70% one day, and that's what will result in our total share increasing of total IRS. You're welcome. Yeah. Great question. First of all, I'll reiterate what you heard from us earlier. The fact that the revenue decelerated was primarily because we're lapping a big price increase and some lineup changes from last year. The fundamental health of the business is consistent with what it was last quarter. So that's number one. Number two, our durable focus remains the same, which is -- we are integrating Mailchimp and QuickBooks. I'd be happy to talk about that more, if there are questions about it, two, mid-market, third, international. And we're being really very aggressive in international. In fact, I was just most recently in London, spent time with our new leader in Mailchimp that leads EMEA, that came from another company where he has built a really a large international business, and two, visited a number of customers and partners, and we're being very aggressive with our approach in what we've done with the platform, what we're doing with our pricing and then the marketing investments that we are making as we look ahead. And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, there are five areas where we are accelerating our investment. This is one of them. And so we're quite excited about the possibilities given the green shoots that we're seeing. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah. Thank you, and great to hear from you. The -- one of our fundamental execution philosophies that we have at the company is conviction on the long-term, ambitious testing and experimentation in the short term so that we can be nimble, we can learn and we can adjust. And really, the answer to your question is the five areas that you heard that we're accelerating our investments. I mean we are seeing green shoots with our learnings and insights with Intuit Assist, and we're accelerating our investments in GenAI. We -- as I talked about earlier, for the first time, we were increasing our share in the assisted segment. And so we're accelerating a number of areas with TurboTax Live. We are also embedding an expert within QuickBooks Live, within our entire small business platform where every offering will actually come with an embedded expert because we believe, based on green shoots that we've seen, that will improve conversion, it will also improve retention. And mid-market, I mean, we have been really assertive in building out capabilities in the platform. We have been asserted in building out our customer-facing capabilities from leadership all the way down to our frontline sales folks, and we're seeing great green shoots there to accelerate not only growing with our customers, but I'm hunting for new ones. And as you know, mid-market is not just about getting the customers, it's all the services that comes with the it, payments, payroll, live platform capability. So, Kash, those are the, I would say, key green shoots that we are seeing, all of which we are accelerating our investments currently, by the way, in the quarter and as we head into next year. Thank you. Sure. Well, let me start actually with the -- what we're seeing on our platform with respect to the health of small businesses, if I could just do that for a moment. One of the things that we are seeing, if we look back from today versus the last three to four months, we're actually seeing some improvement in profitability of small businesses on our platform. And that's a good sign compared to the last couple of years. Now within that, the -- depending on the sector that you're in, your performance is driven by the environment. And so for instance, manufacturing -- areas like manufacturing, professional services, auto repair, their profits are actually up nearly 20%, where real estate lending, their profits are actually down 15%. So the net of it is overall, we've seen improvement, depending on the sector you're in, your performance varies. But the net of all of that is that cash reserves are down 8% compared to this time last year, but up over 16% compared to pre-COVID. So what you should take away is small businesses are healthier but their cash reserves have been impacted. And for those that are on our platform, by the way, over four years, their cash reserves are over 60% higher than those that have only been with us for a year. Last thing I would just say is hours worked is actually up compared to the last quarter. Specific to your payroll question, let me ask Sandeep to answer specifically what you asked about payroll. Very welcome. Yeah, Brad, great question. I was actually in San Diego all day yesterday with the TurboTax team doing deep dives on all of these durable priorities. One of them was full service. First of all, I would tell you that across all of the states, across different income levels, across all complexities, very consistent. And I would say that if you heard -- not if you heard, if you reflect back on what I said in the remarks, that our new customers in full service tripled, an outsized element of that was those that are sort of younger, the millennials, and they are actually embracing full service as a cohort more than others, not by an incredible amount, but it stands out for us. So I think what we learned -- and that's a big deal by the way. What we learned is, we were successful just in one area. But I'll tell you the biggest area we are constructively dissatisfied when you look at our overall assisted performance. We were very aggressive with our go-to-market and not just spend but the beginnings of being able to recommend an expert, the beginnings of when you search for a local expert us showing up. There's a lot of infrastructure that we built. We drive a lot of traffic to our front doors. Where we are constructively dissatisfied is, we have to work on our shopping experience. When you walk into somebody's firm, a store or somebody's home to have them do your taxes for you, you're not presented with a set of SKUs. You just go in there and you exchange documents and they do their taxes for you. Our shopping experience has to be improved. That's where we saw the biggest drop off. So what we have a lot of confidence in is the demand that we created. And by the way, the performance. But the demand that we created was exceptional. We need to get better at the shopping experience. It's one of the areas where -- by the way we saw this during the season, and there's a lot of work that's being done to actually leverage AI to personalize the experiences so that when we get a customer that comes in, that comes from an assisted method, they're actually greeted by an expert versus greeted with which SKU do you want to pick. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah, Steve, thank you for the question. I'm actually pleased with our progress, and I'll share some of the proof points, and I will also just remind us, we're still in the early days, but a lot has changed in the last three months. So let me share what those are. First of all, in TurboTax, 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to better understand the refund outcome and be able to get their questions answered. And not just the customer but Intuit Assist help our experts be much more efficient and effective in helping our customers. And as you can imagine, we would not have rolled that out to 24 million folks if that wasn't accretive to conversion. The second is Credit Karma. In Credit Karma, we have over 40 million monthly active users, and we have rolled out Intuit Assist capabilities, and I'll share what those are in a moment, to nearly half of our 40 million monthly active users. And what we have rolled out are the following things: one, to help you make a decision. And so by the way, if any of you on the call are Credit Karma users, and you happen to have iOS, unless you are in a holdout cell, you'll be able to see everything that I am articulating. So you will see things like Intuit Assist that we'll show you see why, see comparisons, let me help you. And when you engage, it helps you actually understand and have a conversation about which card is right for you. In the past, we always were able to use your data to deliver personalized experiences for you. In this case, personalized cards that are right for you, but now we can have a conversation with you and help you understand why one is better than the other. That's one huge element. The other is help you make financial decisions, help you understand how to build your credit, help you understand how to better save money, help you understand which cards are best to use and which cards you should reduce your utilization. That's what we've rolled out. And again, as you can imagine, we would not have rolled that out to almost 20 million Credit Karma members if it wasn't accretive to better monetization. And then the last couple of examples that I would use is on the small business side, where Mailchimp, nearly 300,000 customers have Intuit Assist available to them, particularly and specifically around personalized marketing campaigns, where you can -- where we help you put a campaign together, images, text, et cetera. And in -- across the QuickBooks platform, we have capabilities available to nearly 30,000-ish customers. And the capability is really about turning unstructured data into money and personalized feed. What that means is taking your e-mail as an example, and taking everything that's in your e-mail and turning it into an invoice that's paid and labeled so that you can get paid faster, and that's a monetizable event for us. And then business feeds that helps you orient to what's most important insight for the day, which ultimately depending on what you engage with is a monetizable event for us. So we've made a lot of progress in the last 90 days. And we're even more hopeful about what's possible in the future. I'll just end with -- it's early days, but it's amazing the progress that the team has made in the last 90 days. Yeah, very welcome. Brad, thank you for your question. First of all, I would say, this actually was the first real season with full service. Last year, it was still -- although we rolled that out, it was still at the experiment level. With that said, to answer your question, a couple of things. One, because we were quite aggressive with our go-to-market, we learned that we can create a lot of demand. And we created a lot of demand not only by talking about the fact that we can do your taxes in less than a day, we can help extend your money and give you early access or immediate access to your money. But there is a lack of price transparency in the entire assisted segment, where you don't really know what you're going to pay until you walk into somebody's store or a firm. And we did a lot of testing to understand how important price is. We learned that it matters a lot. And so we created a lot of demand. That's number one. Number two, when you search locally for an expert or -- and/or if we showed you in when you engage with full services, there's an expert near you, the conversion rates were significantly higher than when we didn't so up in search. And that, by the way, is just an element of time. We'll be able to get all of what we were doing this year rolled out across all of our customers. But that's an enormous learning that local matters. People want to be able to search for pro-near-me, folks want to know that their expert is nearby, and we saw a significant expert or conversion lift. Last thing that we saw as a great proof point is, I think this was more towards the middle, towards the end of season, you could recommend your expert. That had a big conversion one. But we were not able to scale that for the entire season or to all of our customers, which we plan to do next year. So those are the big insights and the big learnings. And last, I'll just end with the following, which is what I mentioned a moment ago, we have a lot of work to do on our shopping experience. And to simply put it, when you walk into somebody's firm or a store, you're not presented with a SKU in a lineup. You just walk in and get -- have them get your taxes done. And that's what we are working on, which is, in essence, when you pick full service, you're greeted by the expert versus a pricing lineup to make a choice. And that with an enormous learning this year, all of which we're currently working on for next year that give us a lot of confidence. Yeah. You're very welcome. Yeah. Thank you for the question. And Sandeep, please feel fear to build. I would say that overall, we feel good about our paid share because if you -- and we cut it multiple different ways internally. But if you look at what we've shared in our remarks, total IRS grew 1%. Our total paying customers grew 2%, and our retention grew 3 points. So we actually feel good about our paying share. I think what you heard us remark on is, where we lost share, which we're okay with because it was actually an intentional focus on the things that we've talked about today, was on customers that are, in essence, simple filers that are bouncing between platforms. And that's the area where we articulated earlier that we lost share. So that's the way I would have you think about our performance is when it comes to paying share, we actually feel good about our performance. You're very welcome, Scott. Sure. Let me -- thank you for the question. And let me answer your question, but if I'm not answering your question directly, please come at me again. I think what you heard us talk about earlier is, one, we've been in the middle of a business model shift moving all of our desktop customers to subscription. And at the same time, we've been building capabilities on our online platform. So eventually, all of our desktop customers have a destination, which is online. And we believe, over time, all of our desktop customers at one point will be on our online platform. With that said, the thing that I would say is that we've really built out a lot of our capabilities on QuickBooks Advanced. And in fact, we are aggressively building a number of capabilities that we'll be excited to talk to all of you about at Investor Day, really targeting even larger customers. And I think we'll be far better positioned to take on some of our larger enterprise customers that may choose to want to come to our online platform. And that's really the essence of what we were talking about earlier. As you think about our desktop franchise looking ahead, one, we have desktop enterprise that's growing high single digits. Number two, we view that we can get most of our customers over time to go to our online platform and price to value also plays an important role. And with all that said, I just think we're better positioned for some of our larger customers that come to our QB Advanced over time. And that's what really gives us confidence as we look into the future. Welcome. Yeah, sure. Let me get us started. Sandeep, please jump in if you have any perspective to add. I'm not sure I understood the premise of your question, so let me just share what you should take away. What you should take away is the strength of our small business franchise is being driven by our online performance. Overall, it grew 18% or our online actually grew 19%, our services grew 20% and we actually feel very good about the trajectory of the business. And as we talked about, as we look ahead, we believe that desktop will continue to grow once the business model shift comes to an end, but that continued growth will come from the fact that half of desktop is enterprise, and it's growing high -- we anticipate it to grow high single digits. But the takeaway should be that in a macro environment, that is somewhat uncertain. Our online performance for small business has been quite strong, very resilient, and we're actually seeing a lot of engagement and usage by our customers just because it's really helping them manage their cash flow. It's helping them grow their business, and I think we're very well positioned in this environment. You're very welcome. Yeah. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with the fact that the Mailchimp lapping price increase from last year and some of the lineup changes that we talked about earlier impacts international growth, just since 50% of Mailchimp's revenue is international. So that was a big driver of why 12%. And two, yes, absolutely, given the green shoots that we are seeing with Mailchimp internationally and where we have product market fit with QuickBooks and Mailchimp, one of the five areas that we are accelerating our investments is, in fact, international. So we're excited about what's possible as we look at. Yeah, very welcome. Well, listen, everybody, thank you so much for attending. Thank you for your wonderful questions, and we will see you at our next earnings. Be safe. Bye-bye."

We had another strong quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform. We\u2019re executing on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew by 11%, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2024 full year guidance of 11% to 12% revenue growth while expanding operating margins. Let\u2019s start with tax. We are confident in our innovation and game plan to win, and are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance of 7% to 8% revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories, which we have barely started to penetrate. We are well-positioned to disrupt the assisted category by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform, to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. By leveraging the power of our platform and ecosystem, we\u2019re also extending TurboTax to our Credit Karma members and QuickBooks Online small business customers by enabling them to complete their taxes and access expertise directly within these products. Let me share more about our \u2013 the areas of focus this season. First, we can serve consumers however they want to file, virtually or in-person, while providing confidence their taxes are being done accurately and they are getting their maximum refund. More than 80% of U.S. filers live within a 10 mile radius of a TurboTax expert. These experts use Intuit\u2019s Virtual Expert Platform that\u2019s powered by data and AI, to deliver best-in-class service. While it\u2019s early in the season, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with customers. We\u2019re seeing strong growth and the offering has a Product Recommendation Score of 88 season-to-date, one of the highest at Intuit. Second, small businesses can file their taxes with TurboTax and, if a small business is a QuickBooks Online customer, they can file their taxes with an expert. With these offerings, they can maximize their refund, and get advice from experts when they need it. Our campaigns and easy to use experience are driving strong early interest. Business tax returns have a much higher average revenue per return because they are more complex and we expect them to contribute to average revenue per return expansion over time. Third, we\u2019re more deeply integrating Credit Karma and TurboTax, making it even more seamless for Credit Karma members to file with TurboTax directly in the Credit Karma app, with exclusive offers for members, whether they want to file themselves or with an expert. We\u2019re also unlocking the benefits of the Credit Karma platform for tax filers to make smart money decisions. This includes earlier access to their refund or, for those that qualify, access to an interest-free Refund Advance loan in as little as 30 seconds after IRS acceptance, when depositing their refund into a Credit Karma Money account. This is designed to lead to higher engagement and monetization in Credit Karma over time. Fourth, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, is live in TurboTax this season. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of \"done for you,\" where the hard work is done \"automagically\" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. For example, customers are using Intuit Assist to better understand their refund. In early results, Intuit Assist\u2019s helpfulness rating is 1.5x greater than our legacy explanations, indicating Intuit Assist is helping deliver confidence to TurboTax customers. Our focus this tax season further showcases how our Big Bets have accelerated innovation and growth for the future. We\u2019re leveraging the power of data and AI with Intuit Assist to revolutionize the speed to benefit for customers, disrupting the assisted consumer and business tax categories by connecting people with experts virtually, and bringing the TurboTax and Credit Karma experience together to unlock smart money decisions. We are off to a great start in tax. Let me now highlight progress across two of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to \"revolutionize speed to benefit.\" Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our other Big Bets. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform, with data and AI fueling innovation across the platform. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business, and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer which fuels what\u2019s possible with AI. And with our GenAI Operating System, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough GenAI experiences across our platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost efficient way. As I mentioned earlier, with Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of \"done for you,\" where the hard work is done \"automagically\" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their success. Intuit Assist is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade, and is in the hands of select customers now. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform, driving customer growth, accelerated adoption of services and live offerings. I\u2019m excited about the rapid pace at which we are innovating, testing, learning, and adapting to deliver our core benefits of more money, no work and complete confidence for customers. Let me share a few updates. First TurboTax, as I shared earlier, Intuit Assist is live in the product this season and is delivering increased confidence to our customers. Second, Mailchimp, to help small businesses grow revenue and save them time, we\u2019re providing AI-powered automations and content generation using Intuit Assist. Third, QuickBooks, Intuit Assist is in beta and is designed to help small businesses optimize cash flow and make confident decisions to grow their business. New customers who were previously running their business manually will be able to get started quickly by sharing their email, website and bank account information. Their unstructured data will be translated into benefits for them, such as generating customized pay-enabled invoices that save time and enable customers to get paid faster, experiencing the benefits of switching to a digital platform. And for existing customers, we will translate their data and analyze their money in and money out transactions into insights and recommendations. Intuit Assist will do the work for our customers in the background with suggested automated actions that increases customer productivity by saving time and leading to better outcomes such as getting paid faster and updating capital. Furthermore, we intend to provide an option to connect and interact with an expert to help provide insights and make decisions specific to their financial situation and fuel their success at the moments that matter most, such as closing their books. Fourth, Credit Karma, Intuit Assist for Credit Karma is in beta and we\u2019re excited about the rapid innovation and the progress we\u2019re making to help connect members to financial products that are right for them, saving them time and money. We\u2019re focused on using GenAI to interact with members to help answer their questions in a highly personalized way when shopping for financial products. Customers can interact, learn more, and ask questions to help make confident decisions. Intuit Assist will engage more members with a wide range of financial needs beyond Credit. We recently expanded by 6x the number of topics we can provide help on and now address items like major purchases, home buying, savings, and more. We believe this can drive increased member engagement and conversion, and drive higher revenue per monthly active user. We remain excited with our early progress with Intuit Assist across the company. It\u2019s changing our relationship with customers as we move from being a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that customers can rely on daily to power their prosperity. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. In Mailchimp, we\u2019re focused on better serving mid market customers across different stages of their lifecycle to drive higher engagement and retention. After we have successfully onboarded them, we\u2019re pairing larger customers with an account manager to help them understand and adopt the breadth of Mailchimp\u2019s capabilities. We\u2019re seeing green shoots from account management, which gives us confidence in the future. Customers who have engaged with an account manager have higher monthly revenue retention. We believe this will also drive higher ARPC over time. Intuit Assist is live in Mailchimp\u2019s higher end offerings and is designed to help customers develop personalized marketing campaigns and drive their revenue growth. We\u2019re offering customers three AI-powered automations today, including new customer welcome, abandoned shopping cart and recovering lost customers. Automations are time consuming to set up, but can drive higher revenue. Intuit Assist personalized automations are 50% more likely to be activated by customers. Intuit Assist is also reducing work by generating new content and editing existing content for marketing campaigns. Recent improvements have driven GenAI text generation adoption rates by more than 70% over the past several months, reducing work for our customers. Getting paid fast remains a big challenge for small businesses. We are uniquely positioned to help customers with our end-to-end money platform and innovations such as easy discovery, auto-enabled payments, payment-enabled invoices, instant deposit and get paid up front, which are all helping our customers get paid faster and drive adoption of payments. Total online payment volume growth was 20% in the quarter. We are beginning to roll out a new payment-enabled invoicing experience that will provide more benefits to customers, including more ways to get paid. While early, we\u2019re seeing that customers who use the new invoicing experience are engaging more driving increase in customer adoption of our payment rails to get their invoices paid. We\u2019re also making progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. The number of connections in our QuickBooks business network has doubled since August, and we\u2019re pleased with the initial adoption of our bill pay offering. To better serve small businesses, during the quarter, we began rolling out faster payment timelines for qualified customers that reduce payment time by 40%, including a paid next-day ACH option and batch payments, allowing customers to hold on to their cash longer and save time. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We\u2019re honored to be recognized by Bloomberg as one of the top 50 Companies to Watch in 2024 and to be ranked 22 on this year\u2019s Just 100, and the highest ranked customer or software company on the list. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep.\nSandeep Aujla: Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered another strong quarter, despite the IRS opening approximately one week later this year. We achieved healthy operating margins and are on track to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to deliver operating leverage across the business. Our Q2 results include revenue of $3.4 billion, up 11%, GAAP operating income of $369 million versus $270 million last year, up 37%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion versus $856 million last year, up 17%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 versus $0.60 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.20 last year, up 20%. Turning to our business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 21%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 19% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on both go-to-market and product innovations. While mid-market customers are a smaller subset of the total small business TAM, they drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services across our platform. This coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem services to existing customers, shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 24% in Q2, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher end offerings. Within payments, the revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow, higher effective prices and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16% in Q2. Now moving to our Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens. We are more than two years into a three-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In fiscal 2025, the tailwinds from the three-year transition will be behind us, but we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktops subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or our desktop enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term. Shifting to our Consumer and ProTax Groups. Our full year outlook remains unchanged, even though Consumer Group revenue declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting an approximately one week later IRS opened this year. We are confident in our game plan to win this season and are reiterating our guidance for Consumer Group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Turning to the ProTax Group, the revenue grew 8% to $274 million in Q2, reflecting the timing of when tax forms were delivered, which is a driver for revenue recognition. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, flat to a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in Credit Karma Money, credit cards and auto loans offset by decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance. We saw select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q2, reflecting expected macro trends. And as a reminder, Q2 is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 to benefit from additional Credit Karma Money revenue during tax season. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year. Now shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $536 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on our market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on April 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12% and GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%; non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%. GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $7.77 to $7.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.31 to $9.38. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full year fiscal 2024 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Sandeep. And just to quickly wrap up, we\u2019re very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy, our progress with our five big bets, and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe that this will change our relationship with our customers, becoming their trusted advisors, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With that, let\u2019s open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Sasan and Sandeep, I want to dig into the health of the small business. Just two part question, on the online accounting system, revenue seems to be in line, our expectation site to decel. Is there any one-time factor that influenced and how should you think about second half, given that\u2019s an easy comp? And other part is on the services, while we\u2019re pleasantly surprised, it\u2019s accelerated. And you talked about some of this payroll payments and Mailchimp. Is there anything like you are doing differently, specifically drilling into the Mailchimp, how is that part of the business doing?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. Maybe I\u2019ll start us off. And Sandeep, please jump in as you wish. I mean as the headline that I would give Siti is that we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that we have, the growth that we\u2019ve experienced. When you think about it in context of the current macro environment, we\u2019re continuing to see larger, higher value customers, mid market customers want to shift to digitization. And the more we spend time with them, with our account managers, with our sales folks, with our customer success folks, they tend to have a tendency of wanting to move more of their services to us because for the most part, we are already the standard of financial management solutions that they use for their financial records. But they see it as an opportunity to get paid faster, manage their workforce to be able to use our capabilities, to be able to market to their customers. And so the net of it that I would leave you with is I like our momentum in this macro environment. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes in our online accounting and online services. And so I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. The most important element to take away is the 21% overall online growth. And our services are strong and we continue to innovate with our services. And I expect that we\u2019ll continue to lead digitization and transformation for our small businesses. Sandeep, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything, but those would be the headlines for me, Siti.\nSandeep Aujla: Yes. Sasan, good coverage [ph]. Siti, what I would also remind you of is, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, there are three imperatives that you focus on as a management team, new customer acquisition, driving adoption of our platform and being better together across our platform. And with that in new customer acquisition, our team continues to focus on mid-market customers. As you call those mid-market customers, they\u2019re a larger, richer revenue pool. They have higher customer acquisition costs, but they also take a little longer to ramp up because most of the size of the price in those mid-market customers on services revenue, which ramps up as opposed to accounting, which you start booking as soon as they become a customer, so just a dynamic to keep in mind. That\u2019s why in my prepared remarks, I called out that our growth formula will continue to start leaning more towards ARPC going forward. And the second component of the services is basically us executing on our focus of driving adoption of our platform.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks. Great execution, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hi, congratulations to Sasan and Sandeep. Really good call here. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us an update on what\u2019s happening in the SMB market. Looks like enterprise spending seems to be stabilizing. I know that you\u2019re not really enterprise except for QuickBooks Advanced, but how did you characterize the outlook for small businesses given that the economy is on stable footing and we don\u2019t have the worries that we had going into calendar 2022? Thank you so much once again.\nSasan Goodarzi: Kash, great to hear from you. Great question. I would \u2013 let me categorize the answer in two buckets. First of all, facts are friendly, and let me start with some facts. What we see across our base is that cash reserves are down 11% year-over-year. That\u2019s really what small businesses care about. But it\u2019s actually up 115% over pre-pandemic levels. And so the takeaway you should have in that is small businesses are being challenged in this macro environment. Consumers are spending less dollars, but they\u2019re actually healthier at the aggregate level than they were several years ago. In fact, what I would call out is the number of hours worked is higher this year, several points compared to last year. So that just the strength of the work that they\u2019re doing, being able to have access to talent is in a better position for small businesses compared to last year. And that, by the way, as you can imagine differs by country and by sector, sectors like real estate, IT spending is struggling if the sector small business is in, but things like professional services, auto repairs is actually quite healthy. Last thing I would end with is the higher value customers more the mid-market customers are healthier than those that are small and just starting out, which by the way, we\u2019ve seen this in our 20 plus years, right, we\u2019ve seen this is a normal trend whereby the larger businesses have a lot more levers to be able to pull and they\u2019re generally healthier. Lastly, our view, and we\u2019re not economists, but we see a lot of data. Our view is that 2024 is going to be a lot of the same for small businesses. We don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s going to be any kind of an economic tailwind as we think about the next \u2013 the rest of the calendar year.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much and nice job in Q2. Maybe a tax question, just with the slower start to the season, Sasan, and we appreciate every season is more and more backend loaded, but can you talk about what it is that you\u2019re seeing in the funnel and anything else that supports your confidence in the full year consumer guide? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure, Brad. First of all, I\u2019ll amplify what you started out with. Having been in the tax business and ran it more than ten years ago and watching our trends in the last ten years. Every season there\u2019s a push to a later start, and it\u2019s just a consumer behavior, and we\u2019re seeing that this year, so that\u2019s not anything unique. There\u2019s two things that I would call out that are strategic to us, that are worth calling out, because we see green shoots in both with the early part of season. One is full service. Just as a refresher, there\u2019s nearly 100 million consumers and small businesses that spend about $30 billion to have somebody else do their taxes for them. And we really leaned into our overall full service experience, we really leaned into our campaigns, both on air, digital. Very basic things, by the way, that we didn\u2019t used to have the capabilities of that we\u2019re now building, which is if you use an expert and you love that expert, that you can recommend that expert to a friend, that, that\u2019s basics. But the infrastructure that we\u2019re building to really disrupt the full service space is a necessity. And we feel very good about the green shoots that we\u2019re seeing, both on the consumer front and on the business tax front. And I\u2019ll remind you that this is our first year leaning all the way into business tax. So it\u2019s beyond early, but everything that we\u2019ve seen just indicates that this is enormous opportunity for us. So that\u2019s on the full service front. The second I would mention is Credit Karma. This is really an area where we have nearly 45 million monthly active users. They engage more than five times a month, and the majority of those monthly active users actually use a different method and not TurboTax. And so we\u2019ve really heavily invested in the experience, whether you want to do it yourself in the app or you want us to do it for you, which is full service and compelling offerings that we\u2019ve been testing and scaling. And we also like the green shoots there. So those are the two things that I would call out, and it really positions us for share of spend. I\u2019ll end with the following, which is we\u2019ve set the goal line in taxes, our share of total IRS returns, and really what matters is the share of spend that we\u2019re getting. And full service is essential for that, both this year and in the future.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks, Sasan. Great color, and keep up the good work. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. I was hoping we could go back to the mix of online services, and maybe you could just help us compare and contrast in more detail what you\u2019re seeing from a growth perspective across the payroll payments and Mailchimp business? And is there a float aspect at all to the payroll portion of the business that might be helping reinforce some of the margin strength you\u2019re seeing? Given headwinds from the slower start to tax? I think a lot of focus on just the EPS strength in the quarter. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sure. Do you mind repeating the last part of your question?\nMichael Turrin: Yes. Just wondering if there\u2019s at all on the payroll side a flow component that might be also just softly helping margin outside of the consumer headwinds you\u2019re seeing.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Let me start with the overall services question that you asked and Sandeep will weigh in here with some of the facts that you asked around flow. I think the thing that I would just say around services goes back to my earlier comment, which is we\u2019re just spending a lot more time with higher value customers really helping them understand what we can do to digitize their businesses, and by the way, continuing to improve our offerings. And so as we talked about earlier, our total online payments growth this quarter was 20% in a fairly tough macro environment. That\u2019s because we continue to invest in making the experience easier, providing multiple methods to get paid instant deposit, getting paid upfront. So those really help with, in essence, payments adoption. Our payroll adoption has been strong, particularly larger customers and with full service, and we\u2019re continuing to really invest in some of the most important foundational elements with Mailchimp that higher value customers are adopting, and particularly some of the things that I called out with intuitive. So it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s a combination of all of our services and the focus on higher value customers that is really helping us with some of the services adoption. Maybe. Sandeep, I\u2019ll turn it over to you on the float and anything else you want to add.\nSandeep Aujla: Sure. So thanks, Sasan. Michael, the float component is a very small part of our payroll business, as one thing that we really aim to do for our small businesses is to hold their cash as little as possible. So float is not a big component for us. And I think the overarching theme of your question was the ability for Intuit to preserve the earnings power of the company despite the one week delay in the IRS opening. I think Sasan touched on that. And it\u2019s also some of the great work that the team has been doing around acquiring larger customers around the lineup, work we did to make the higher end SKUs in payroll more attractive to those customers. The work the team is doing around mid market account management and Mailchimp. So it\u2019s a plethora of activities that continues to give us confidence across portfolio of assets that we have here at Intuit.\nMichael Turrin: Appreciate the details there. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yes, hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe another one on online services. So if I heard you correctly earlier, it sounds like you guys are expecting a more stable macro environment as we move throughout the year. So can you just talk about what that means for the durability of the acceleration in online services that we just saw to 24% year-over-year? Could you actually see online services hang in here at these levels? Was there anything one-time in nature? And just curious, as the macro remains more challenging, how the pricing lever could be used there to help you guys during this time? Thanks so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, sure. Taylor, let me add a few things if I could. First of all, I\u2019ll start with we don\u2019t view the macro environment as entirely remaining stable. We think it\u2019s going to continue to be uncertain. So we\u2019re not sort of banking on any of our growth coming from any type of a tailwind from the macro environment. We think 2024 will be somewhat choppy, like 2023 was from a macro environment perspective. And we see it in the consumer \u2013 credit scores of consumers. As you know, we see over 100 million members across Credit Karma. And their credit scores in the last couple of years are down almost 20 points. Gen Z credit card balances are up over 60% and those are just a couple of illustrative examples that consumers are strained. So the first uber-point would be that we think the environment is stable to uncertain and we\u2019re not trying to outguess the economy, but really focus on our customers and our innovation, which gets to the second point, and that is we have confidence in the guidance that we provided of the 16% to 17% for the year, even in context of the macro environment, just because we continue to really emphasize and focus with our high value mid-market customers digitization. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s leading to our overall 21% online growth that we talked about. And that\u2019s what gives us confidence in our guidance. And really, as we look into the future, our entire focus is really all about our innovation and our go-to-market to win, despite the tough economic environment.\nSandeep Aujla: Taylor, the one thing I would add, and just to build on Sasan\u2019s point, you asked a question around pricing, pricing power. Our tenant around pricing is around the power of our offerings and the innovation we\u2019re building into the offerings. And the perceived actual value that we\u2019re delivering to our customers is not related to the macro environment. So that\u2019s another point I just wanted to emphasize in terms of how we think about our pricing.\nTaylor McGinnis: Thanks. Really appreciate the thoughts.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Sasan, maybe a GenAI question for you. Clearly it\u2019s something that continues to really evolve and become a core part and parcel of the company, both on the SMB side and the consumer side. I wanted to ask, if you look at the coming tax season on the consumer side, how do you expect to see the benefit of some of the assist functionality? Is it more converting kind of free to pay? Is it pay to pay more? And then similarly on both Credit Karma and on the SMB side, if you think about the progression of the year, kind of where are you seeing the biggest opportunities as you start to see the interactions build on the platform?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, Alex, thank you. Great question. Let me start with one headline, particularly as we\u2019ve been in beta or with certain capabilities at scale and GA. I\u2019ll start with a headline which is we believe that over time, and I want to emphasize the overtime piece, that this is going to create an entirely new category of experiences and growth that is not even possible today because of truly creating a set of experiences where the work is done for customers. And there\u2019s always a gateway to human expert that\u2019s all AI powered. And the more we\u2019re in market, the more we\u2019re learning, adjusting, adapting, the more we are convinced that we\u2019re going to be able to create a new category of services and what\u2019s possible to penetrate our $300 billion in TAM. Now with that said, let me get real specific and sort of real tactical. The second headline news that I would give is none of the work that we\u2019re doing with Intuit Assist, which is really about what we\u2019re doing across the platform. It\u2019s not a feature. None of it is in our results today, and we\u2019re not counting on it to be in our results in the near future. But with that said, to answer your question in tax, to start with, there\u2019s a couple of areas where it will have profound impact. One is full service. And the profound impact, by the way, is from the investments that we\u2019ve made in the last five years. I mean, to do what we\u2019re doing in full service at scale and think about it, it\u2019s really based on data, AI, ecosystem of apps, because now we can do your taxes through Credit Karma, through the cookbooks platform and one of the largest networks of experts that we have. And all of that sits on machine learning, knowledge engineering and now GenAI capabilities. So the biggest in our view, based on what we\u2019re seeing in market, right, the biggest opportunity is about the ease and the speed of getting people\u2019s taxes done. So imagine a world where you\u2019re a full service customer that we can get your taxes done in less than an hour, maximum refund and extend your dollars because of what we can do with you on the Credit Karma platform and excellent service, the best service you can imagine in the world, which by the way is supported by our product recommendation score of 88. So really it\u2019s full service that will have the biggest impact. Now the whole underlying platform is what full service uses. And so the other is over time. Yes, it will help with conversion. And really it\u2019s about confidence. And we\u2019re seeing that right now where Intuit assist when it\u2019s engaged to understand my tax outcome and refund outcome, the helpful rating is one and a half times better than we\u2019ve ever seen and by the way, we are very early, we haven\u2019t perfected it by any means. So that\u2019s on the tax front. Just very quickly, let me touch on Credit Karma. As you know, one of the powers of Credit Karma on behalf of our customers is we know everything about the customer. We know have all the data and leverage AI to deliver personalized credit cards that are right for them, or personal loans, whatever it may be. One thing that\u2019s profound with GenAI that we\u2019re learning and seeing in market today is now customers can interact with Credit Karma, whereas before they couldn\u2019t. The from to is, the from is, I would show you the three credit cards that are right for you based on everything that I know about you. But now you can interact with Credit Karma and ask, hey, I\u2019m looking for travel rewards, which of these three credit cards are the best for me? And then we interact with you and help you understand, which one is the best for you based on an additional set of questions that you\u2019ve asked, where we now know more about you. That\u2019s profound, because that will, over time, drive higher engagement, monetization, et cetera. And on the small business front, our entire focus is revenue and profitability increase. Everything that we are testing in market, learning in market is so that we can help you with campaigns that increases your revenue or manage your cash flow that better helps you with profitability. And one of the things we\u2019re testing with is to have experts that actually provide insights to you and those insights could be, hey, it\u2019s time to take out capital because your sales are strong, or hey, I just finished doing your books for you. Would you like to have a conversation so you can understand your cash flow and how your books close for the month? And that\u2019s a monetizable event for us. So probably a longer answer that you were looking for, but those are the things that are in market where we\u2019re learning and adjusting and we think over time. We haven\u2019t perfected any of this yet, because it\u2019s actually hard, but we believe it\u2019ll create an entirely new category of services and growth.\nAlex Zukin: Super insightful. Thank you, guys.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. And I\u2019ll echo the congrats on the quarter. Yes, Sasan, can you just remind us where we are in terms of some of the cross-sell of QuickBooks into the Mailchimp base and vice versa? And when Intuit Assist goes GA for QuickBooks, will that be the point at which Intuit \u2013 can answer questions across sort of the front office and back office for customers? Can you just talk about that a little bit? Thanks so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, great question, Kirk. Let me start with the Intuit Assist question first. And I\u2019ll share with you how we\u2019re sequencing it. Right now our entire focus and remember, everything that we are doing here is based on data and AI. A lot of our investments are what you don\u2019t see, which is ensuring that the data is usable, that it\u2019s clean, that it\u2019s structured the right way, and that our machine learning, knowledge engineering and GenAI capabilities can digest all of the data. Inclusive of data by the way, that\u2019s contributed by the customer, like access to their Gmail account, access to their Excel spreadsheet, because a lot of customers data are in those two places, or they\u2019re in shoeboxes and being able to take pictures. And for us to be able to digest that data and actually deliver insights. So our first priority of order is to ensure that if you\u2019re using our small business platform and if you are looking to put together marketing campaigns, that Intuit Assist is doing that for you. The second element of what we are focused on is then being able to transfer and use Intuitive Assist across QuickBooks and Mailchimp, because all the data points are connected. That is absolutely where we are headed and it\u2019s sequenced in second place compared to what I just articulated, because we have to nail via the basics. But that\u2019s actually where the power of our platform will show up for our customers, where whether you\u2019re in Credit Karma or TurboTax, you can ask whatever question you want that is relevant in your life and we can answer it because all of our data points are connected and our AI capabilities are, in essence, working across the product. So that is sequence, but we\u2019re working on that as we speak. The second is cross-sell. First of all, I\u2019ll start with we\u2019re not thinking about it in terms of cross-sell. We\u2019re thinking about it in terms of product integration. So what we are really focused on, and this is, by the way, this applies to TurboTax and Credit Karma. This applies to Mailchimp and QuickBooks. What we\u2019re really focused on is integrating the product at moments of truth that matters most based on how the customer does the work. Like, for instance, if you are in QuickBooks on your left lap [ph]. This is just an illustrative example because we\u2019re actually testing a lot of this, is that you can actually see how you can manage your customers and put together marketing campaigns. And when you engage and click on that, you have the Mailchimp engine that is working behind the scenes. And after maybe a couple of free trials, then we share with you how much it is to pay for these capabilities. So that\u2019s what I mean by product integration. We want to nail the benefits at the moment of truth that matters versus just try to sell you Mailchimp within the platform. We\u2019ve found over time that that\u2019s not as effective. What\u2019s most effective is the product integration. So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking across all of our platforms.\nKirk Materne: That\u2019s it. Thanks so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you. You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Just on for [ph] Credit Karma to get back to growth, what are the key ingredients that you need to see for that to get back to growth versus the declines we\u2019ve seen the last year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, a good question. A couple of things. One, which we are starting to see, which is just stability of partners and the environment. For the most part, other than some select partners, we\u2019ve actually seen stability with our partners. And we\u2019ve actually seen verticals like insurance come back, which saw a big decline last year. So one is just stability, and then the second is just the areas of innovation that we are focused on. One is we\u2019ve redesigned the entire app. Now it\u2019s rolled out to all members, which is a massive, massive feat. And based on the redesign of the app, there are many ways in which we can engage customers more so than we could before. And that will actually drive monetization. So that\u2019s one lever beyond the macro that I mentioned. The second is Intuit Assist. It\u2019s the example I provided earlier where now customers can actually interact with us and ask questions and let us know what\u2019s important to them and we can personalize things in a way that we could never before. And based on very early testing, we see the engagement is higher when customers are interacting with Intuit Assist, which over time will lead to monetization. That\u2019s the second area. Third is just a number of initiatives that we have around prime. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, prime is actually quite a large part of our monthly active users, but we\u2019ve never really focused on it and now that\u2019s an area of focus. And then last but not least is TurboTax. And TurboTax, the way we\u2019re thinking about it is actually about product integration because the more we can engage members year round around, if they took out a mortgage or having them take a snapshot of their W-2 and letting them know what their refund could be, the more we can actually penetrate more of the members to use TurboTax as a method to get their access to the refund, all those things creating one platform is what we believe and are confident actually that will get us to accelerated growth and it\u2019s really in that order. So let me pause there hopefully, is that helps Brent?\nBrent Thill: Yes, it was great. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping to get your thoughts on the opportunity for additional bill pay options. I believe Sasan, you mentioned in your prepared remarks rolling out same day ACH. But any high level thoughts on other bill pay options, including virtual credit cards? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes, thank you for the question. First of all, the key to success for us, given where we are on the rollout is one network connections. And as you heard in our remarks, albeit very early, the number of business network connections has doubled since August. And that\u2019s important because it helps, it\u2019s a huge step forward to then digitize how we in essence help customers get paid and pay bills. The second is just executing on our roadmap. The big thing that we\u2019re starting to roll out that we talked about earlier is just faster payments and that\u2019s through both paid ACH next day that we\u2019re rolling out and also batch payments. And so we\u2019re going to continue to look at what\u2019s most important for our customers and that\u2019s what\u2019s informing our roadmap. But we have to do it in conjunction with continuing to increase network connections. And we\u2019re really excited about in the long term what\u2019s possible, digitizing all of B2B, because it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly beneficial to our customers because they get paid faster, and two, it\u2019s really a sticky product.\nJames Friedman: Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: You\u2019re very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats for me as well. Question for Sandeep. As we think about this year, you kind of said you didn\u2019t expect a lot of kind of recovery to help. It\u2019s just like how you manage the business. But if you think about cost, so far you\u2019ve been doing really well on margins. But there\u2019s also obviously an element of getting ready for things are getting better. How do you see the progression of investments this year? Thank you.\nSandeep Aujla: Hey Raimo. Thanks for that question. Super important one, and let me share some of my thoughts. First and foremost, I\u2019ll start with the fact that we\u2019re deliberately building this business to scale growth while increasing our profitability. In fact, those are principle ones and two of our financial principles that we use to manage this company. So that\u2019s a very deliberate approach that we are taking. And we have a track record of expanding margin over the years while bringing innovation to markets such as Intuit Assist, such as building innovation to address the opportunity we have in the mid-market such as innovation to localize products in Mailchimp for the international market. So we are not leaving growth opportunities on the table with our focus to scale growth and drive innovation. Now, the second component of your question, in terms of the profitability profile so far this year, we look at our margins and aim to deliver our margin commitments for the full year. And I feel quite confident in our path to do so. And the performance we had in the first couple of quarters, in fact, bolster the confidence that I have in our full year guidance.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. So, Sasan, within the QuickBooks business you have this growth vector in the up market [ph], and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re able to comment on the growth and traction that you\u2019re seeing in that 10 to 100 employee segment versus the one to nine or zero to nine employee segment. For instance is one of those growing mid-20s and the other is high teens just interested in how much of a spread you see there and maybe where you see it trending this year?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. I\u2019ll add a perspective and would invite Sandeep to chime-in as well. I think the short answer is we are seeing more traction in our higher value customers and our mid-market customers, which I think to your frame is 10, 15 employees and up or more higher revenue customers. We are seeing more traction there, more momentum there. And by the way a big part of it is that\u2019s where we\u2019re really focusing our innovation, our go-to-market. At the same time to be clear we \u2013 we always remain paranoid and always believe in the notion of disrupting from the low end, which is by the way why we just launched a Solopreneur offering, which is to be able to serve those small businesses that in essence they\u2019re on their own. Because we believe that it\u2019s helping entrepreneurs when they\u2019re a team of one, because one-day some will become a team of thousands. So we\u2019re not taking our eye off the ball on the low-end at all, but we\u2019re doubling down on our focus on the higher value customers. And yes, we do see more resiliency, more momentum with these larger customers.\nSandeep Aujla: And to covered the topic, the only thing I would add is that the unit economics on the upmarket is also something that we find quite attractive. These customers, they tend to scale to much higher ARPC especially as we get them to adopt our platform. They by definition have more employees. They by definition of processing more payments, so that\u2019s also something that we find attractive and is very much an area that we are having our go-to-market teams and our product teams deliberately lean in this year.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nSandeep Aujla: Very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Enders with Citi.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe just on the SMB side again; I think you made a comment in the prepared remarks about shifting towards ARPC over time as a growth lever. I guess one want to clarify that comment and then secondarily, does that change how you think about the levers of growth moving forward for the SMB segment, more towards ARPC, away from the customer side?\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks for the question, Steve. The way we think about it, and as we were just addressing in the prior question, we see tremendous opportunity in the mid-market for those that we currently define as having ten to 100 employees. And what really excites us about this opportunity is that these customers come with a much higher lifetime value, much higher ARPC, and have better retention. And so that just helps out our economics, but these customers also tend to have higher customer acquisition costs and there are relatively fewer of those than the smaller customers by definition, when you look at the overall addressable market. So as we focus on these larger customers, that means we will get higher ARPC per customer, even though there are fewer of those. So that is where the growth formula, we continue to abide by the growth formula that we have publicly discussed about 10% to 20% customer growth, 10% to 20% ARPC growth. But as we continue to focus on the mid market, you should expect us to lean in more towards the ARPC growth because of this dynamic with the mid-market, and that we think that\u2019s actually a good thing for the business going forward.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Sasan, a couple of task questions. One, we\u2019re three weeks in. We\u2019re pretty well through the early season. You had anticipated earlier, before the tax season that we would see a probably flattish year for the industry. And that felt kind of conservative. Now that we\u2019re in a bit and we\u2019ve also seen a return to DIY category shift, I\u2019m curious if you have any update on what you\u2019re seeing for the industry overall thus far. And then the second part is on full service. You sound very happy with it, the 88 number recommendation score. Could you speak to some of the growing pain points you had last year and the fixes you\u2019re seeing this year as you\u2019re working your way through the early season? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. Our view, having been through however many tax seasons we\u2019ve been through as a company, is it\u2019s early in the season to estimate how many folks will ultimately file when it\u2019s all said and done. With that said, our belief is still the same. It will probably be total of number of filers will probably flattish, maybe up a little bit. Our perspective really hasn\u2019t changed because our focus is how do we win as many filers within the category that are going to file. So the first answer is our view hasn\u2019t really changed. The second, on full service and some of the growing pains, I would call out a few from last year compared to what we\u2019re doing this year. One is, we actually made it difficult for customers to get into full service last year. And by the way, it was more trying to ensure the customers were really, really getting into the right service. But we had so much friction that we had created up front. And if you think about somebody that just walks into somebody\u2019s home or office and sort of hands everything over and says, here, get my taxes done. And then they interact until three or four weeks later until their taxes are done, the notion of engaging and putting a lot of friction up and asking a lot of questions up front is not a behavior they\u2019re used to. So that was a big learning and growing pain, a lot of which we have removed all the friction and engage \u2013 get a customer to engage an expert, depending on what we know about them, very, very early. So that\u2019s one. I think the second one, we learned a lot about what did and did not work in our campaigns last year. And there\u2019s a lot we are doing differently to really help customers, both on air, digitally, but also the infrastructure that we are working on, which, by the way, is not going to be done this season. Right. We\u2019re going to be investing in it for several years. Were basic things which, by the way, are very powerful, where if I did your taxes and you love the work that I did for you, and by the way, our product recommendation score of 88 would suggest that our experts are delivering excellent service. You\u2019d want to recommend me to your friend? Well, last year you could not do that. And this year we\u2019re building the capabilities that you could actually recommend me to a friend. And that virality is a very big thing, especially when you have an 88 product recommendation score. And then lastly is 43% of those that use an assisted method, that choose to switch to somebody else. 43% will actually go on Google and Google is there a tax pro near me? And again, that\u2019s another example of where we didn\u2019t have the infrastructure to show up and we\u2019re building that infrastructure. So I can tell you for a fact, in San Jose, California, right or in Los Gatos, I should say if you put in tax pro near me, we will show up top of the list. We being TurboTax. If you do it in Atlanta, which is where I was a few weeks ago, we don\u2019t show up because we\u2019re working on. So that\u2019s an example of the things that we learned last year that we\u2019re implementing this year, but not just for this tax season, but really to nail it with excellence as we think about the future.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. This one\u2019s for Sandeep as well. Another margin question, but a little bit of a different angle. When it comes to generative AI, we\u2019re really been talking a lot about the potential top line impacts. Are there operating margin benefits that you guys can see through? Just better usage of the GenAI technology internally, whether it\u2019s stuff like code assist or whatnot. And then on the flip side of the equation, given that a lot of this stuff is still ramping up. Is there anything we should be looking out for on the gross margin line in terms of just like these capabilities being that much more compute intensive and that much more impactful on COGS versus what you\u2019re seeing in consent assessment today? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Keith. So let me start by just reminding us all that the GenAI cost for the current fiscal year have been incorporated into our guidance. So that\u2019s first and foremost. But now let me address the themes of your question as I think about the cost structure, and I\u2019ll focus on the cost structure, since that\u2019s where your question was. We actually feel that we are quite advantageous versus the market in the sense that the data that we have, that we have touched on, that\u2019s residing behind our firewalls, that we are training our large language models on, that are delivering more contextually relevant answers at a faster speed versus other generally available large language models, and that they are doing that at a fraction of the cost. So just from a unit economics point of view, for the GenAI, it\u2019s actually advantageous the way we are running it. Two, we don\u2019t have our own data center, and we rely on AWS and other third party data centers to run our model. So that, again, is a cost advantage because we don\u2019t have that build out cost as some others might have. Furthermore, as I look across our business, I do see opportunities for us to, over time, improve our economics using GenAI and AI. Now, we\u2019ve already given examples on things such as in customer success, where agents no longer have to take notes or spend minutes summarizing the call that they just had. AI does that, and that\u2019s just one small example. But expect that to continue to lead to more efficiencies in a customer success calls lead to more better unit economics in a full service than live offerings, as you kind of carry that forward. Also, how we are staffing up builders in terms of project managers to designers to engineers ratios. So I see many opportunities for us to continue to benefit from GenAI, and I feel good about the early start that we have leaning into some of those capabilities.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. So, Net-net, it seems like a positive dynamic versus something that could drag on margins overall.\nSasan Goodarzi: That would be the right takeaway, I guess.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer period. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right, awesome, everybody. Thank you for listening in. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Be safe. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

            "name": "Sandeep Aujla",
            "content": "Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered another strong quarter, despite the IRS opening approximately one week later this year. We achieved healthy operating margins and are on track to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to deliver operating leverage across the business. Our Q2 results include revenue of $3.4 billion, up 11%, GAAP operating income of $369 million versus $270 million last year, up 37%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion versus $856 million last year, up 17%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 versus $0.60 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.20 last year, up 20%. Turning to our business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 21%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 19% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on both go-to-market and product innovations. While mid-market customers are a smaller subset of the total small business TAM, they drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services across our platform. This coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem services to existing customers, shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 24% in Q2, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher end offerings. Within payments, the revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow, higher effective prices and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16% in Q2. Now moving to our Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens. We are more than two years into a three-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In fiscal 2025, the tailwinds from the three-year transition will be behind us, but we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktops subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or our desktop enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term. Shifting to our Consumer and ProTax Groups. Our full year outlook remains unchanged, even though Consumer Group revenue declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting an approximately one week later IRS opened this year. We are confident in our game plan to win this season and are reiterating our guidance for Consumer Group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Turning to the ProTax Group, the revenue grew 8% to $274 million in Q2, reflecting the timing of when tax forms were delivered, which is a driver for revenue recognition. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, flat to a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in Credit Karma Money, credit cards and auto loans offset by decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance. We saw select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q2, reflecting expected macro trends. And as a reminder, Q2 is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 to benefit from additional Credit Karma Money revenue during tax season. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year. Now shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $536 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on our market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on April 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12% and GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%; non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%. GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $7.77 to $7.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.31 to $9.38. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full year fiscal 2024 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Yes. Sasan, good coverage [ph]. Siti, what I would also remind you of is, as we've shared in the past, there are three imperatives that you focus on as a management team, new customer acquisition, driving adoption of our platform and being better together across our platform. And with that in new customer acquisition, our team continues to focus on mid-market customers. As you call those mid-market customers, they're a larger, richer revenue pool. They have higher customer acquisition costs, but they also take a little longer to ramp up because most of the size of the price in those mid-market customers on services revenue, which ramps up as opposed to accounting, which you start booking as soon as they become a customer, so just a dynamic to keep in mind. That's why in my prepared remarks, I called out that our growth formula will continue to start leaning more towards ARPC going forward. And the second component of the services is basically us executing on our focus of driving adoption of our platform. Sure. So thanks, Sasan. Michael, the float component is a very small part of our payroll business, as one thing that we really aim to do for our small businesses is to hold their cash as little as possible. So float is not a big component for us. And I think the overarching theme of your question was the ability for Intuit to preserve the earnings power of the company despite the one week delay in the IRS opening. I think Sasan touched on that. And it's also some of the great work that the team has been doing around acquiring larger customers around the lineup, work we did to make the higher end SKUs in payroll more attractive to those customers. The work the team is doing around mid market account management and Mailchimp. So it's a plethora of activities that continues to give us confidence across portfolio of assets that we have here at Intuit. Taylor, the one thing I would add, and just to build on Sasan's point, you asked a question around pricing, pricing power. Our tenant around pricing is around the power of our offerings and the innovation we're building into the offerings. And the perceived actual value that we're delivering to our customers is not related to the macro environment. So that's another point I just wanted to emphasize in terms of how we think about our pricing. Hey Raimo. Thanks for that question. Super important one, and let me share some of my thoughts. First and foremost, I'll start with the fact that we're deliberately building this business to scale growth while increasing our profitability. In fact, those are principle ones and two of our financial principles that we use to manage this company. So that's a very deliberate approach that we are taking. And we have a track record of expanding margin over the years while bringing innovation to markets such as Intuit Assist, such as building innovation to address the opportunity we have in the mid-market such as innovation to localize products in Mailchimp for the international market. So we are not leaving growth opportunities on the table with our focus to scale growth and drive innovation. Now, the second component of your question, in terms of the profitability profile so far this year, we look at our margins and aim to deliver our margin commitments for the full year. And I feel quite confident in our path to do so. And the performance we had in the first couple of quarters, in fact, bolster the confidence that I have in our full year guidance. And to covered the topic, the only thing I would add is that the unit economics on the upmarket is also something that we find quite attractive. These customers, they tend to scale to much higher ARPC especially as we get them to adopt our platform. They by definition have more employees. They by definition of processing more payments, so that's also something that we find attractive and is very much an area that we are having our go-to-market teams and our product teams deliberately lean in this year. Very welcome."

Second quarter revenue grew by 11%, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2024 full year guidance of 11% to 12% revenue growth while expanding operating margins. Let's start with tax. We are confident in our innovation and game plan to win, and are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance of 7% to 8% revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories, which we have barely started to penetrate. We are well-positioned to disrupt the assisted category by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform, to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. By leveraging the power of our platform and ecosystem, we're also extending TurboTax to our Credit Karma members and QuickBooks Online small business customers by enabling them to complete their taxes and access expertise directly within these products. Let me share more about our \u2013 the areas of focus this season. First, we can serve consumers however they want to file, virtually or in-person, while providing confidence their taxes are being done accurately and they are getting their maximum refund. More than 80% of U.S. filers live within a 10 mile radius of a TurboTax expert. These experts use Intuit's Virtual Expert Platform that's powered by data and AI, to deliver best-in-class service. While it's early in the season, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with customers. We're seeing strong growth and the offering has a Product Recommendation Score of 88 season-to-date, one of the highest at Intuit. Second, small businesses can file their taxes with TurboTax and, if a small business is a QuickBooks Online customer, they can file their taxes with an expert. With these offerings, they can maximize their refund, and get advice from experts when they need it. Our campaigns and easy to use experience are driving strong early interest. Business tax returns have a much higher average revenue per return because they are more complex and we expect them to contribute to average revenue per return expansion over time. Third, we're more deeply integrating Credit Karma and TurboTax, making it even more seamless for Credit Karma members to file with TurboTax directly in the Credit Karma app, with exclusive offers for members, whether they want to file themselves or with an expert. We're also unlocking the benefits of the Credit Karma platform for tax filers to make smart money decisions. This includes earlier access to their refund or, for those that qualify, access to an interest-free Refund Advance loan in as little as 30 seconds after IRS acceptance, when depositing their refund into a Credit Karma Money account. This is designed to lead to higher engagement and monetization in Credit Karma over time. Fourth, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, is live in TurboTax this season. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of \"done for you,\" where the hard work is done \"automagically\" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. For example, customers are using Intuit Assist to better understand their refund. In early results, Intuit Assist's helpfulness rating is 1.5x greater than our legacy explanations, indicating Intuit Assist is helping deliver confidence to TurboTax customers. Our focus this tax season further showcases how our Big Bets have accelerated innovation and growth for the future. We're leveraging the power of data and AI with Intuit Assist to revolutionize the speed to benefit for customers, disrupting the assisted consumer and business tax categories by connecting people with experts virtually, and bringing the TurboTax and Credit Karma experience together to unlock smart money decisions. We are off to a great start in tax. Let me now highlight progress across two of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to \"revolutionize speed to benefit.\" Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our other Big Bets. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform, with data and AI fueling innovation across the platform. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business, and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer which fuels what's possible with AI. And with our GenAI Operating System, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough GenAI experiences across our platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost efficient way. As I mentioned earlier, with Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of \"done for you,\" where the hard work is done \"automagically\" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their success. Intuit Assist is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade, and is in the hands of select customers now. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform, driving customer growth, accelerated adoption of services and live offerings. I'm excited about the rapid pace at which we are innovating, testing, learning, and adapting to deliver our core benefits of more money, no work and complete confidence for customers. Let me share a few updates. First TurboTax, as I shared earlier, Intuit Assist is live in the product this season and is delivering increased confidence to our customers. Second, Mailchimp, to help small businesses grow revenue and save them time, we're providing AI-powered automations and content generation using Intuit Assist. Third, QuickBooks, Intuit Assist is in beta and is designed to help small businesses optimize cash flow and make confident decisions to grow their business. New customers who were previously running their business manually will be able to get started quickly by sharing their email, website and bank account information. Their unstructured data will be translated into benefits for them, such as generating customized pay-enabled invoices that save time and enable customers to get paid faster, experiencing the benefits of switching to a digital platform. And for existing customers, we will translate their data and analyze their money in and money out transactions into insights and recommendations. Intuit Assist will do the work for our customers in the background with suggested automated actions that increases customer productivity by saving time and leading to better outcomes such as getting paid faster and updating capital. Furthermore, we intend to provide an option to connect and interact with an expert to help provide insights and make decisions specific to their financial situation and fuel their success at the moments that matter most, such as closing their books. Fourth, Credit Karma, Intuit Assist for Credit Karma is in beta and we're excited about the rapid innovation and the progress we're making to help connect members to financial products that are right for them, saving them time and money. We're focused on using GenAI to interact with members to help answer their questions in a highly personalized way when shopping for financial products. Customers can interact, learn more, and ask questions to help make confident decisions. Intuit Assist will engage more members with a wide range of financial needs beyond Credit. We recently expanded by 6x the number of topics we can provide help on and now address items like major purchases, home buying, savings, and more. We believe this can drive increased member engagement and conversion, and drive higher revenue per monthly active user. We remain excited with our early progress with Intuit Assist across the company. It's changing our relationship with customers as we move from being a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that customers can rely on daily to power their prosperity. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. In Mailchimp, we're focused on better serving mid market customers across different stages of their lifecycle to drive higher engagement and retention. After we have successfully onboarded them, we're pairing larger customers with an account manager to help them understand and adopt the breadth of Mailchimp's capabilities. We're seeing green shoots from account management, which gives us confidence in the future. Customers who have engaged with an account manager have higher monthly revenue retention. We believe this will also drive higher ARPC over time. Intuit Assist is live in Mailchimp's higher end offerings and is designed to help customers develop personalized marketing campaigns and drive their revenue growth. We're offering customers three AI-powered automations today, including new customer welcome, abandoned shopping cart and recovering lost customers. Automations are time consuming to set up, but can drive higher revenue. Intuit Assist personalized automations are 50% more likely to be activated by customers. Intuit Assist is also reducing work by generating new content and editing existing content for marketing campaigns. Recent improvements have driven GenAI text generation adoption rates by more than 70% over the past several months, reducing work for our customers. Getting paid fast remains a big challenge for small businesses. We are uniquely positioned to help customers with our end-to-end money platform and innovations such as easy discovery, auto-enabled payments, payment-enabled invoices, instant deposit and get paid up front, which are all helping our customers get paid faster and drive adoption of payments. Total online payment volume growth was 20% in the quarter. We are beginning to roll out a new payment-enabled invoicing experience that will provide more benefits to customers, including more ways to get paid. While early, we're seeing that customers who use the new invoicing experience are engaging more driving increase in customer adoption of our payment rails to get their invoices paid. We're also making progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. The number of connections in our QuickBooks business network has doubled since August, and we're pleased with the initial adoption of our bill pay offering. To better serve small businesses, during the quarter, we began rolling out faster payment timelines for qualified customers that reduce payment time by 40%, including a paid next-day ACH option and batch payments, allowing customers to hold on to their cash longer and save time. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We're honored to be recognized by Bloomberg as one of the top 50 Companies to Watch in 2024 and to be ranked 22 on this year's Just 100, and the highest ranked customer or software company on the list. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Great. Thank you, Sandeep. And just to quickly wrap up, we're very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy, our progress with our five big bets, and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe that this will change our relationship with our customers, becoming their trusted advisors, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With that, let's open it up to your questions. Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. Maybe I'll start us off. And Sandeep, please jump in as you wish. I mean as the headline that I would give Siti is that we're really pleased with the momentum that we have, the growth that we've experienced. When you think about it in context of the current macro environment, we're continuing to see larger, higher value customers, mid market customers want to shift to digitization. And the more we spend time with them, with our account managers, with our sales folks, with our customer success folks, they tend to have a tendency of wanting to move more of their services to us because for the most part, we are already the standard of financial management solutions that they use for their financial records. But they see it as an opportunity to get paid faster, manage their workforce to be able to use our capabilities, to be able to market to their customers. And so the net of it that I would leave you with is I like our momentum in this macro environment. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And there's a lot of puts and takes in our online accounting and online services. And so I wouldn't read anything into it. The most important element to take away is the 21% overall online growth. And our services are strong and we continue to innovate with our services. And I expect that we'll continue to lead digitization and transformation for our small businesses. Sandeep, I don't know if you want to add anything, but those would be the headlines for me, Siti. Thank you. Kash, great to hear from you. Great question. I would \u2013 let me categorize the answer in two buckets. First of all, facts are friendly, and let me start with some facts. What we see across our base is that cash reserves are down 11% year-over-year. That's really what small businesses care about. But it's actually up 115% over pre-pandemic levels. And so the takeaway you should have in that is small businesses are being challenged in this macro environment. Consumers are spending less dollars, but they're actually healthier at the aggregate level than they were several years ago. In fact, what I would call out is the number of hours worked is higher this year, several points compared to last year. So that just the strength of the work that they're doing, being able to have access to talent is in a better position for small businesses compared to last year. And that, by the way, as you can imagine differs by country and by sector, sectors like real estate, IT spending is struggling if the sector small business is in, but things like professional services, auto repairs is actually quite healthy. Last thing I would end with is the higher value customers more the mid-market customers are healthier than those that are small and just starting out, which by the way, we've seen this in our 20 plus years, right, we've seen this is a normal trend whereby the larger businesses have a lot more levers to be able to pull and they're generally healthier. Lastly, our view, and we're not economists, but we see a lot of data. Our view is that 2024 is going to be a lot of the same for small businesses. We don't believe that there's going to be any kind of an economic tailwind as we think about the next \u2013 the rest of the calendar year. Yes. You're very welcome. Yes. Sure, Brad. First of all, I'll amplify what you started out with. Having been in the tax business and ran it more than ten years ago and watching our trends in the last ten years. Every season there's a push to a later start, and it's just a consumer behavior, and we're seeing that this year, so that's not anything unique. There's two things that I would call out that are strategic to us, that are worth calling out, because we see green shoots in both with the early part of season. One is full service. Just as a refresher, there's nearly 100 million consumers and small businesses that spend about $30 billion to have somebody else do their taxes for them. And we really leaned into our overall full service experience, we really leaned into our campaigns, both on air, digital. Very basic things, by the way, that we didn't used to have the capabilities of that we're now building, which is if you use an expert and you love that expert, that you can recommend that expert to a friend, that, that's basics. But the infrastructure that we're building to really disrupt the full service space is a necessity. And we feel very good about the green shoots that we're seeing, both on the consumer front and on the business tax front. And I'll remind you that this is our first year leaning all the way into business tax. So it's beyond early, but everything that we've seen just indicates that this is enormous opportunity for us. So that's on the full service front. The second I would mention is Credit Karma. This is really an area where we have nearly 45 million monthly active users. They engage more than five times a month, and the majority of those monthly active users actually use a different method and not TurboTax. And so we've really heavily invested in the experience, whether you want to do it yourself in the app or you want us to do it for you, which is full service and compelling offerings that we've been testing and scaling. And we also like the green shoots there. So those are the two things that I would call out, and it really positions us for share of spend. I'll end with the following, which is we've set the goal line in taxes, our share of total IRS returns, and really what matters is the share of spend that we're getting. And full service is essential for that, both this year and in the future. Thank you, Brad. Sure. Do you mind repeating the last part of your question? Yes. Let me start with the overall services question that you asked and Sandeep will weigh in here with some of the facts that you asked around flow. I think the thing that I would just say around services goes back to my earlier comment, which is we're just spending a lot more time with higher value customers really helping them understand what we can do to digitize their businesses, and by the way, continuing to improve our offerings. And so as we talked about earlier, our total online payments growth this quarter was 20% in a fairly tough macro environment. That's because we continue to invest in making the experience easier, providing multiple methods to get paid instant deposit, getting paid upfront. So those really help with, in essence, payments adoption. Our payroll adoption has been strong, particularly larger customers and with full service, and we're continuing to really invest in some of the most important foundational elements with Mailchimp that higher value customers are adopting, and particularly some of the things that I called out with intuitive. So it's really \u2013 it's not one thing, it's a combination of all of our services and the focus on higher value customers that is really helping us with some of the services adoption. Maybe. Sandeep, I'll turn it over to you on the float and anything else you want to add. Thank you, Michael. Yes, sure. Taylor, let me add a few things if I could. First of all, I'll start with we don't view the macro environment as entirely remaining stable. We think it's going to continue to be uncertain. So we're not sort of banking on any of our growth coming from any type of a tailwind from the macro environment. We think 2024 will be somewhat choppy, like 2023 was from a macro environment perspective. And we see it in the consumer \u2013 credit scores of consumers. As you know, we see over 100 million members across Credit Karma. And their credit scores in the last couple of years are down almost 20 points. Gen Z credit card balances are up over 60% and those are just a couple of illustrative examples that consumers are strained. So the first uber-point would be that we think the environment is stable to uncertain and we're not trying to outguess the economy, but really focus on our customers and our innovation, which gets to the second point, and that is we have confidence in the guidance that we provided of the 16% to 17% for the year, even in context of the macro environment, just because we continue to really emphasize and focus with our high value mid-market customers digitization. And that's really what's leading to our overall 21% online growth that we talked about. And that's what gives us confidence in our guidance. And really, as we look into the future, our entire focus is really all about our innovation and our go-to-market to win, despite the tough economic environment. You're very welcome. Yes, Alex, thank you. Great question. Let me start with one headline, particularly as we've been in beta or with certain capabilities at scale and GA. I'll start with a headline which is we believe that over time, and I want to emphasize the overtime piece, that this is going to create an entirely new category of experiences and growth that is not even possible today because of truly creating a set of experiences where the work is done for customers. And there's always a gateway to human expert that's all AI powered. And the more we're in market, the more we're learning, adjusting, adapting, the more we are convinced that we're going to be able to create a new category of services and what's possible to penetrate our $300 billion in TAM. Now with that said, let me get real specific and sort of real tactical. The second headline news that I would give is none of the work that we're doing with Intuit Assist, which is really about what we're doing across the platform. It's not a feature. None of it is in our results today, and we're not counting on it to be in our results in the near future. But with that said, to answer your question in tax, to start with, there's a couple of areas where it will have profound impact. One is full service. And the profound impact, by the way, is from the investments that we've made in the last five years. I mean, to do what we're doing in full service at scale and think about it, it's really based on data, AI, ecosystem of apps, because now we can do your taxes through Credit Karma, through the cookbooks platform and one of the largest networks of experts that we have. And all of that sits on machine learning, knowledge engineering and now GenAI capabilities. So the biggest in our view, based on what we're seeing in market, right, the biggest opportunity is about the ease and the speed of getting people's taxes done. So imagine a world where you're a full service customer that we can get your taxes done in less than an hour, maximum refund and extend your dollars because of what we can do with you on the Credit Karma platform and excellent service, the best service you can imagine in the world, which by the way is supported by our product recommendation score of 88. So really it's full service that will have the biggest impact. Now the whole underlying platform is what full service uses. And so the other is over time. Yes, it will help with conversion. And really it's about confidence. And we're seeing that right now where Intuit assist when it's engaged to understand my tax outcome and refund outcome, the helpful rating is one and a half times better than we've ever seen and by the way, we are very early, we haven't perfected it by any means. So that's on the tax front. Just very quickly, let me touch on Credit Karma. As you know, one of the powers of Credit Karma on behalf of our customers is we know everything about the customer. We know have all the data and leverage AI to deliver personalized credit cards that are right for them, or personal loans, whatever it may be. One thing that's profound with GenAI that we're learning and seeing in market today is now customers can interact with Credit Karma, whereas before they couldn't. The from to is, the from is, I would show you the three credit cards that are right for you based on everything that I know about you. But now you can interact with Credit Karma and ask, hey, I'm looking for travel rewards, which of these three credit cards are the best for me? And then we interact with you and help you understand, which one is the best for you based on an additional set of questions that you've asked, where we now know more about you. That's profound, because that will, over time, drive higher engagement, monetization, et cetera. And on the small business front, our entire focus is revenue and profitability increase. Everything that we are testing in market, learning in market is so that we can help you with campaigns that increases your revenue or manage your cash flow that better helps you with profitability. And one of the things we're testing with is to have experts that actually provide insights to you and those insights could be, hey, it's time to take out capital because your sales are strong, or hey, I just finished doing your books for you. Would you like to have a conversation so you can understand your cash flow and how your books close for the month? And that's a monetizable event for us. So probably a longer answer that you were looking for, but those are the things that are in market where we're learning and adjusting and we think over time. We haven't perfected any of this yet, because it's actually hard, but we believe it'll create an entirely new category of services and growth. Yes. Thank you, Alex. Yes, great question, Kirk. Let me start with the Intuit Assist question first. And I'll share with you how we're sequencing it. Right now our entire focus and remember, everything that we are doing here is based on data and AI. A lot of our investments are what you don't see, which is ensuring that the data is usable, that it's clean, that it's structured the right way, and that our machine learning, knowledge engineering and GenAI capabilities can digest all of the data. Inclusive of data by the way, that's contributed by the customer, like access to their Gmail account, access to their Excel spreadsheet, because a lot of customers data are in those two places, or they're in shoeboxes and being able to take pictures. And for us to be able to digest that data and actually deliver insights. So our first priority of order is to ensure that if you're using our small business platform and if you are looking to put together marketing campaigns, that Intuit Assist is doing that for you. The second element of what we are focused on is then being able to transfer and use Intuitive Assist across QuickBooks and Mailchimp, because all the data points are connected. That is absolutely where we are headed and it's sequenced in second place compared to what I just articulated, because we have to nail via the basics. But that's actually where the power of our platform will show up for our customers, where whether you're in Credit Karma or TurboTax, you can ask whatever question you want that is relevant in your life and we can answer it because all of our data points are connected and our AI capabilities are, in essence, working across the product. So that is sequence, but we're working on that as we speak. The second is cross-sell. First of all, I'll start with we're not thinking about it in terms of cross-sell. We're thinking about it in terms of product integration. So what we are really focused on, and this is, by the way, this applies to TurboTax and Credit Karma. This applies to Mailchimp and QuickBooks. What we're really focused on is integrating the product at moments of truth that matters most based on how the customer does the work. Like, for instance, if you are in QuickBooks on your left lap [ph]. This is just an illustrative example because we're actually testing a lot of this, is that you can actually see how you can manage your customers and put together marketing campaigns. And when you engage and click on that, you have the Mailchimp engine that is working behind the scenes. And after maybe a couple of free trials, then we share with you how much it is to pay for these capabilities. So that's what I mean by product integration. We want to nail the benefits at the moment of truth that matters versus just try to sell you Mailchimp within the platform. We've found over time that that's not as effective. What's most effective is the product integration. So that's the approach that we're taking across all of our platforms. Thank you. You're very welcome. Yes, a good question. A couple of things. One, which we are starting to see, which is just stability of partners and the environment. For the most part, other than some select partners, we've actually seen stability with our partners. And we've actually seen verticals like insurance come back, which saw a big decline last year. So one is just stability, and then the second is just the areas of innovation that we are focused on. One is we've redesigned the entire app. Now it's rolled out to all members, which is a massive, massive feat. And based on the redesign of the app, there are many ways in which we can engage customers more so than we could before. And that will actually drive monetization. So that's one lever beyond the macro that I mentioned. The second is Intuit Assist. It's the example I provided earlier where now customers can actually interact with us and ask questions and let us know what's important to them and we can personalize things in a way that we could never before. And based on very early testing, we see the engagement is higher when customers are interacting with Intuit Assist, which over time will lead to monetization. That's the second area. Third is just a number of initiatives that we have around prime. As we've mentioned before, prime is actually quite a large part of our monthly active users, but we've never really focused on it and now that's an area of focus. And then last but not least is TurboTax. And TurboTax, the way we're thinking about it is actually about product integration because the more we can engage members year round around, if they took out a mortgage or having them take a snapshot of their W-2 and letting them know what their refund could be, the more we can actually penetrate more of the members to use TurboTax as a method to get their access to the refund, all those things creating one platform is what we believe and are confident actually that will get us to accelerated growth and it's really in that order. So let me pause there hopefully, is that helps Brent? You're very welcome. Yes, thank you for the question. First of all, the key to success for us, given where we are on the rollout is one network connections. And as you heard in our remarks, albeit very early, the number of business network connections has doubled since August. And that's important because it helps, it's a huge step forward to then digitize how we in essence help customers get paid and pay bills. The second is just executing on our roadmap. The big thing that we're starting to roll out that we talked about earlier is just faster payments and that's through both paid ACH next day that we're rolling out and also batch payments. And so we're going to continue to look at what's most important for our customers and that's what's informing our roadmap. But we have to do it in conjunction with continuing to increase network connections. And we're really excited about in the long term what's possible, digitizing all of B2B, because it's very \u2013 it's incredibly beneficial to our customers because they get paid faster, and two, it's really a sticky product. You're very welcome. Yes. Sure. I'll add a perspective and would invite Sandeep to chime-in as well. I think the short answer is we are seeing more traction in our higher value customers and our mid-market customers, which I think to your frame is 10, 15 employees and up or more higher revenue customers. We are seeing more traction there, more momentum there. And by the way a big part of it is that's where we're really focusing our innovation, our go-to-market. At the same time to be clear we \u2013 we always remain paranoid and always believe in the notion of disrupting from the low end, which is by the way why we just launched a Solopreneur offering, which is to be able to serve those small businesses that in essence they're on their own. Because we believe that it's helping entrepreneurs when they're a team of one, because one-day some will become a team of thousands. So we're not taking our eye off the ball on the low-end at all, but we're doubling down on our focus on the higher value customers. And yes, we do see more resiliency, more momentum with these larger customers. Thanks for the question, Steve. The way we think about it, and as we were just addressing in the prior question, we see tremendous opportunity in the mid-market for those that we currently define as having ten to 100 employees. And what really excites us about this opportunity is that these customers come with a much higher lifetime value, much higher ARPC, and have better retention. And so that just helps out our economics, but these customers also tend to have higher customer acquisition costs and there are relatively fewer of those than the smaller customers by definition, when you look at the overall addressable market. So as we focus on these larger customers, that means we will get higher ARPC per customer, even though there are fewer of those. So that is where the growth formula, we continue to abide by the growth formula that we have publicly discussed about 10% to 20% customer growth, 10% to 20% ARPC growth. But as we continue to focus on the mid market, you should expect us to lean in more towards the ARPC growth because of this dynamic with the mid-market, and that we think that's actually a good thing for the business going forward. Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. Our view, having been through however many tax seasons we've been through as a company, is it's early in the season to estimate how many folks will ultimately file when it's all said and done. With that said, our belief is still the same. It will probably be total of number of filers will probably flattish, maybe up a little bit. Our perspective really hasn't changed because our focus is how do we win as many filers within the category that are going to file. So the first answer is our view hasn't really changed. The second, on full service and some of the growing pains, I would call out a few from last year compared to what we're doing this year. One is, we actually made it difficult for customers to get into full service last year. And by the way, it was more trying to ensure the customers were really, really getting into the right service. But we had so much friction that we had created up front. And if you think about somebody that just walks into somebody's home or office and sort of hands everything over and says, here, get my taxes done. And then they interact until three or four weeks later until their taxes are done, the notion of engaging and putting a lot of friction up and asking a lot of questions up front is not a behavior they're used to. So that was a big learning and growing pain, a lot of which we have removed all the friction and engage \u2013 get a customer to engage an expert, depending on what we know about them, very, very early. So that's one. I think the second one, we learned a lot about what did and did not work in our campaigns last year. And there's a lot we are doing differently to really help customers, both on air, digitally, but also the infrastructure that we are working on, which, by the way, is not going to be done this season. Right. We're going to be investing in it for several years. Were basic things which, by the way, are very powerful, where if I did your taxes and you love the work that I did for you, and by the way, our product recommendation score of 88 would suggest that our experts are delivering excellent service. You'd want to recommend me to your friend? Well, last year you could not do that. And this year we're building the capabilities that you could actually recommend me to a friend. And that virality is a very big thing, especially when you have an 88 product recommendation score. And then lastly is 43% of those that use an assisted method, that choose to switch to somebody else. 43% will actually go on Google and Google is there a tax pro near me? And again, that's another example of where we didn't have the infrastructure to show up and we're building that infrastructure. So I can tell you for a fact, in San Jose, California, right or in Los Gatos, I should say if you put in tax pro near me, we will show up top of the list. We being TurboTax. If you do it in Atlanta, which is where I was a few weeks ago, we don't show up because we're working on. So that's an example of the things that we learned last year that we're implementing this year, but not just for this tax season, but really to nail it with excellence as we think about the future. Very welcome. Keith. So let me start by just reminding us all that the GenAI cost for the current fiscal year have been incorporated into our guidance. So that's first and foremost. But now let me address the themes of your question as I think about the cost structure, and I'll focus on the cost structure, since that's where your question was. We actually feel that we are quite advantageous versus the market in the sense that the data that we have, that we have touched on, that's residing behind our firewalls, that we are training our large language models on, that are delivering more contextually relevant answers at a faster speed versus other generally available large language models, and that they are doing that at a fraction of the cost. So just from a unit economics point of view, for the GenAI, it's actually advantageous the way we are running it. Two, we don't have our own data center, and we rely on AWS and other third party data centers to run our model. So that, again, is a cost advantage because we don't have that build out cost as some others might have. Furthermore, as I look across our business, I do see opportunities for us to, over time, improve our economics using GenAI and AI. Now, we've already given examples on things such as in customer success, where agents no longer have to take notes or spend minutes summarizing the call that they just had. AI does that, and that's just one small example. But expect that to continue to lead to more efficiencies in a customer success calls lead to more better unit economics in a full service than live offerings, as you kind of carry that forward. Also, how we are staffing up builders in terms of project managers to designers to engineers ratios. So I see many opportunities for us to continue to benefit from GenAI, and I feel good about the early start that we have leaning into some of those capabilities. That would be the right takeaway, I guess. All right, awesome, everybody. Thank you for listening in. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Be safe. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you, everybody."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\nKim Watkins: Thanks, Chelsea. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment. With the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live. Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second, is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service, where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season. We believe this is Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform. And with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way. We are creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by GenAI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First, Mailchimp. We're rolling out two new GenAI experiences, designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time. These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I'll share more on those in just a moment. Second, TurboTax. As I shared earlier during the extension season we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy checks and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season. Third, QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we're serving our proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary. These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers. Fourth, Credit Karma. We're testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of five hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history. This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform. Let me now highlight progress across two of our five big bets. As a reminder, our five big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier. Today, easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter. While it's early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers. Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight two of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months. With Intuit Assist, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign. Second, AI-powered marketing automation, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored way. Today, many of our customers don't use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automation, which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product. Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services. We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for education, a new financial literacy program to provide Gen Z and Gen Alpha students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund, providing grants in [Seven-Eye] (ph) solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be one of the only eight Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep.\nSandeep Aujla: Thank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $3 billion, up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year. Turning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem, which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment. with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-employed group is threefold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online\u2019s accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by Payroll, Mailchimp, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. And within Payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products in October, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1. We -- This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money. Shifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states, both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax. The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season, bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season. Now let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4. As a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax relief. We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: All right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our five big bets and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted adviser, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate at penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With all of that said, let's now open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. Sasan, on the AI strategy, like obviously, you have like one -- it seems like one big platform that is driving it. Like can you -- what's the kind of opportunity to kind of learn from one segment and use it in the other segment? And as part of that also, like are you impacted by the chip shortage? Will that kind of impact the rollout for you? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your question. And I actually think it's a really interesting question that you're asking in terms of how are we learning across platforms. The short answer is we capture best practices and share the insights on a daily basis across our teams. And in fact, I'll just use our staff as an example. We get weekly slacks with documents that share the best practices, the progress that has been made and how that informs the next week across each of the platforms. And we spend 80% of my staff meeting actually doing product reviews of Intuit Assist. A big large part of it is what the key best practices are, learnings are. And I would tell you that there's a lot of commonality in themes across our learnings across the platform, which actually is simply putting us in a position to accelerate our pivot and our progress and innovation and the timing of going GA across the platform. To your second question, no, we're not impacted by the chip shortage. It does not at all impact our launch plans.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Congrats. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question guys, and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Two questions, one for Sasan and one for Sandeep and really digging into what I think were some of the bigger surprises in the quarter, Sasan, in this environment, I think we're surprised to see strength in a marketing platform like Mailchimp and you called that out as part of the strength in online services. Do you think that's more of an Intuit sort of independent factor of repackaging, marketing more aggressively distribution? Or is it -- the market is better than we expect? And then for Sandeep, operating margins were really strong in the quarter. Any one-time items or pull forward expenses or push out expenses that we should be mindful of in terms of why that type of operating margin performance isn't going to be reflected in the rest of the year? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks for the question, Keith. I'll take your first one. What you're seeing from us in Mailchimp is entirely execution. We're not getting tailwinds from the macro environment. And as I mentioned, when we closed the acquisition a while back, that our biggest opportunity was to be clear about our product improvements, our lineup and to be able to create one growth platform, develop strength internationally and go to mid-market. And by the way, we've made a lot of progress in all of those areas. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, to be clear. But everything that you're seeing is based on our execution and no macro tailwinds.\nSandeep Aujla: And on the margin question, Keith -- on the margin question, let me start by reiterating our commitment to having our expenses growth lower than revenue and in essence, delivering our margin expansion and operating leverage, which is something that we hold dearly and our guidance of 40 to 60 bps expansion for the year reflects the discipline that we have as a management team. On the margin for the quarter, I would share that, I won't get too fixated on the quarterly number. We had some expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, including some marketing expenses. And as I shared during the prepared remarks, we are committed to our full year guidance on our operating income. So that's what I would guide you and the teams towards.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Really nice job guys. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Sasan, I wanted to ask about the health of small business. Where do you see right now, strength and weakness in this environment?\nSasan Goodarzi: Thanks for the question, Siti. As you know, we've been in this macro environment for some time now. And the small businesses that we serve are resilient for a couple of reasons. One, they're on our platform. And by digitizing what they do, which is how they grow customers and managing their cash flow, they are far more resilient and as we've shared before, anybody that's on our platform is nearly 20 points higher in their success rate than those that are not on our platform. So we are part of sort of the health that we're experiencing on our platform. With that as context, I would just share a couple of data points. One, the number of companies and the number of employees that our small businesses are hiring still remains strong. Two, our total online payments volume grew 21%, which means that our small businesses are continuing to be competitive. and -- and serving their consumers. I also remind us, by the way, I think, a year ago or more, that growth was in the 30% plus. And so we have seen an impact, but just our overall platform is very resilient. And then the last thing I would say is that the cash reserves of our small businesses is 90% of where it was this time last year. However, it's 128% of where it was pre-pandemic. So their cash flow is stronger than several years ago, but 10% down from last year. And then very specifically, as you know, we serve service-based businesses, which is about 70% of the market. We're not concentrated in any one particular area. But you'll see place things like auto repairs and -- that are doing well, professional services that are doing well. But just like pure construction, those that do lending not doing well. So there's sort of ups and downs across the small businesses that we see. But in aggregate, the health comes from the numbers that I shared with you.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for that color, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAllan Verkhovski: Hi, this is Allan Verkhovski on behalf of Alex Zukin. Thank you for taking the question. QuickBooks Online accounting growth decelerated another 3 percentage points this quarter. With respect to your growth drivers, is there anything that got meaningfully worse in the quarter? Or something that is worth emphasizing to investors? And that will be helpful for thinking about what growth could look like for the rest of the year.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, that was really driven by a larger price increase last year versus this year. That was really the only -- the driver. We liked what we saw in terms of our acquisitions, our retention. So that's really the variance.\nAllan Verkhovski: Okay. And as just a quick follow-up, would you be able to step through the monthly linearity that you saw in Credit Karma through the quarter and in November? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sorry, can you ask your question again?\nAllan Verkhovski: Just on the Credit Karma, thinking about the linearity of the business through the quarter and November, I was wondering if you could just kind of talk through on a monthly basis what you saw in the underlying trends for Credit Karma?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Well, I'll answer your question in two ways. One, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we saw and we anticipated further tightening by our partners. By the way, it happened exactly the same time last year. And so we expected that as a -- our partners prepare for the end of the fiscal year and next year, there would be some further tightening, and that's really what we saw. And that was included in our expectations and in our guidance as we thought about the year. That's number one. Number two, there -- not everything is linear because it depends on the number of days like a month like November based on in the US, based on Thanksgiving week, the number of days that people take off that actually impacts certain behaviors. And so there is no linearity. But the quarter just in total was in line with what we expected.\nAllan Verkhovski: Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Markgraff with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Markgraff: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Yeah, maybe just be curious to understand, Sasan, as you've done some of the testing around Intuit Assist across product categories, has there been any sort of price testing involved in that as well? And how well received has that been if so?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Let me answer your question in two ways because I think they're -- it's a great question, and it's connected. First of all, the biggest insight and learning that we have had is, it's really important to have embedded benefits where the customer is doing the work versus sort of something on the side where the assistant is there to help the customer. So what I mean by that is while a customer is looking to build a marketing campaign right within the flow, we, in essence, help them with the audience they should segment, the audience they should target and then we will build their marketing campaign for them, but with them in complete control. So that's a really -- it may sound really obvious, but it's a really important learning, which, by the way, translates to also what we learned in tax, which is within the flow of helping a customer understand their money outcome, helping them understand and doing accuracy checks for them. And if they miss something, calling it out so they can address it right then and there. Those are examples that, by the way, is consistent across all of our platform workflows where embedded matters a lot. The second is depth, depending on the customer and what they're trying to do, there's a level of depth that they want to go to. So an example is within QuickBooks, one of the things that we've been testing and it's been testing really well is a business summary. And the business summary, in essence, provides what we believe are the most important things that, that customer should know and the customer that engages with those business insights and ultimately, will create reports or ask more questions. What we've learned is we're not building propensity models in terms of the timing of when to connect them to an expert. That's a monetizable event for us because if not, you can go on and on having a Q&A and ultimately not get to the benefit as quickly as possible. So those are major insights and learnings and those insights and learnings have led to how we're thinking about monetization. In the case of Mailchimp, having GenAI SKUs based on the things that we can do for customers automatically on their behalf. In the case of QuickBooks and by the way, TurboTax it's a monetizable event because it's a gateway to human expertise and expert help. And then we will be testing GenAI specific SKUs also in QuickBooks. So those are illustrative examples of based on the benefits that we're learning about what's important to customers, that then informs how we think about price testing. And so far, we're pleased with what we're learning and how fast we're pivoting as a company.\nAlex Markgraff: That's great. Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Enders with Citi.\nSteve Enders: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question here. I guess I'm going to ask on the tax business, what you saw with some of those newer product initiatives and maybe what kind of drove the strength there year-over-year and the share gains with some of those newer initiatives?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Let me answer your question on two dimensions. One, there was a macro element, which there were just more filers in the extension season than we anticipated, both by the way, states that extended and states that did not extend. And these are more complex filers and it's actually our sweet spot. It's why we were able to take share in this extension season. And so that's one element of what drove our better-than-expected results. The three areas that we're excited about, these have been durable priorities where we did a lot of tests and experiments and got a lot of green shoots and learnings that will lead into this coming tax season, it's Credit Karma platform, it's TurboTax Live and its Intuit Assist. And I'll briefly touch on each of them. Within the Credit Karma platform, we have more seamlessly built out the tax experience, whether you want to do it yourself or you want somebody to do it for you. And we've been -- we've developed very compelling SKUs within the Credit Karma platform, which having the opportunity to serve 42 million monthly active users that engage five times a month, was not only a great product, but a great set of SKUs. we saw green shoots and we're excited about that as we look at. The second is TurboTax Live. We expanded the scale of our data, AI and expert network. What that means is, and I'll just point out in two areas. One is the fact that for many customers that want to hand off all their taxes to us, we can get their taxes done within an hour. And that's a very big deal to be able to engage an expert, have your data available and get their taxes done in one setting and then also being able to serve business tax customers, which we'll be launching at scale. Those were areas of green shoots. And the last is Intuit Assist. Two big areas. One is accuracy checks and making sure that in place, we help the customer, in essence, correct something that we believe is a mistake. That's a big conversion driver, by the way. And then the second is just explaining refunds, explaining their money outcome, which is all done and driven by Intuit Assist leveraging our knowledge engineering capabilities and our GenAI capabilities. So those are the three things along with the macro where we saw green shoots that give us a lot of confidence as we head into season.\nSteve Enders: Great. Perfect. Thanks for taking the question.\nSasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you. This is [indiscernible] for Brent. First question on Mailchimp. Wondering if you could share some color on how it's doing in US versus international? And I don't know if you could talk about also about cross-selling synergies with the rest of the small business platform. And second, any update on how the native bill pay is ramping? Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: What was your last question, bill pay?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. On bill pay.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Got it. Thanks for the question. So I'll start with Mailchimp. As we talked about, one of our top priorities includes international. We've spent quite a bit of time and investment in translating to local languages, building out a team that can focus on EMEA and third, making sure that we've got the right pricing lineup and go-to-market plan. And we're executing against that. We like what we see. And it's contributing to the numbers that we reported. And I would say, for us, it's the balance of focus between US and international. We see an enormous opportunity in US and in international. So we have the right balance focus as we think about the geographies. The second, in terms of cross-sell as we shared at Investor Day, we are a big part of the thesis behind the acquisition was to create one growth platform. And what we shared at Investor Day was that we are building an AI native CRM within the QuickBooks platform. We're continuing to make progress in testing and learning and pivoting to get the product market fit. When we get the product market fit. That's really where the cross-sell takes place. We've not assumed or anticipated any contribution from that in our guidance this year. But it's a very important long-term strategic priority. It's the reason why we acquired the platform is to ultimately have one growth platform where you can grow your customers and manage our cash flow all in one place. So that's on the Mailchimp front. On Bill Pay, we're pleased with the fact that we're GA and we -- and as I think noted earlier, what we're seeing with our mid-market customers is -- mid-market versus non-mid market customers, there's a 2x increase in those that are taking the subscription, the paid subscription. So that just means that we're adding value. We also have work ahead of us in Bill pay, things around batch payments, faster funding, all the things that we know we have to have. It's on our roadmap, and it will be launched in the future. So along with the fact that we're GA, we're clear on what the gaps are and what -- and it's on our roadmap, we're working feverishly to really be able to digitize B2B for our customers because we believe it's a big opportunity for our customers to improve their cash flow and a big growth opportunity for us in the long term. So that's the progress on both fronts.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. You're very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Sasan, as you think about the mid-market opportunity for the QuickBooks and the online ecosystem, given the value prop, is it easier to take share during difficult economic times because of that value prop? Or are customers just hesitant to move and wait for the economy to get better before they'll make a back-office switch? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, great question. I'll share two different perspectives in terms of what we're seeing. The first one is, it really doesn't matter what the economic environment is. If it's great, they don't behave differently. If it's challenging like it is now, they don't behave differently. We certainly don't see them -- any of our customers wanting not to switch because the economy is not good, which leads to the second point I wanted to make. So the headline on the first question is, it's not a tailwind or a headwind, whether it's good times or bad times. However, what I would say is we see some green shoots that's early when we do bundling for our customers. When we go to our customers and share with them that they can digitize all of their payments, all of their payroll and the benefits that it will have for our customers from a cash flow perspective, we see that having traction with our customers. And as we've continued to build out our sales team, we're doing, I think, a far better job of account management. And this is an area where if you look back five years ago, we didn't have the kind of value-added account management teams that we're building now where we're engaging our customers, they\u2019re are hearing from us, right? We've been entirely a [self-sell] (ph) platform. And now that we're engaging our customers, a lot of them are starting to realize, wow, you have payments, I didn't realize you have payroll. I didn't you have time tracking. I didn't realize your own Mailchimp. And that is an opportunity for us to drive an increased penetration in wallet share. So I share that just to say that's where we're getting traction. That's where we're seeing progress, and that's where we see an opportunity as we look ahead.\nSandeep Aujla: And Brad, what I'll add is beyond just the QuickBooks side, we also are seeing strong progress on the Mailchimp side in terms of mid-market where historically before we acquired the company was not a focus and now with some of the stuff was Sasan mentioned, including account management, better onboarding, we're seeing better customer acquisition on the mid-market as well as better retention year-over-year in the mid-market, so that opportunity extends beyond just the QuickBooks for us across the entire platform, including Mailchimp.\nBrad Reback: Excellent. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Sasan, I was wondering if you could just talk about the -- I realize you have a vast and sort of wide open TAM in your markets on the small business side. But I was kind of curious if you're seeing any evidence that small businesses are looking to consolidate multiple technologies onto one platform. You all obviously offer a lot both on the front office and as well in the back office. Are you starting to see any of that sort of activity happening now that you're sort of integrating Mailchimp with QuickBooks? I realize it's early days, and you need that to happen to be successful. But I was just wondering if you're seeing any evidence of that yet? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Kirk, the short answer is, it's early, but we're seeing green shoots, and it's primarily because of what I shared just a moment ago, as we're building out our account management team across Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, as we're talking to our customers, and in fact, I personally spoke to three of them in the last month that are very large mid-market customers, two of them in LA and one of them in Miami. And it actually starts with -- they didn't know even know we have, Payments, Payroll. They didn't even know we're the same company that owns Mailchimp as an example. Some of them will use Mailchimp but they'll use QuickBooks. Some of them use our Payroll, but don't use our Payments and so the thing that we're inspired by and where we believe there's a big opportunity is the fact that we actually have a huge differentiation, which is around data, AI and network of experts and an ecosystem of applications. And the applications are all the things that a small business would want. And our account management team is really discovering for us the fact that our customers just don't know. And so therefore, we engage them, build relationships and talk about the benefits of all of our applications and then what could be done based on all of the capabilities that we have around AI and how that could fuel their success. That's what's really opening up doors for us is just the unknown. And that's what we're excited about as we continue to accelerate building out our talent management team. So I think the long answer to your short question is, yes, customers would prefer to be on one platform. And what we're learning is a lot of customers are not because they just actually don't even know what we do holistically, and that's the mission that we are on.\nKirk Materne: Thank you so much.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, you're very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nArti Vula: Hi, this is Arti Vula on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on QuickBooks Advance. You mentioned at your Investor Day that the success of that product is more about just the go-to-market versus kind of a new product or feature development. So can you kind of discuss progress from your perspective on that front? And then in terms of the mid-market, is that -- can you talk about how that's faring in terms of overall health? And maybe compare that to the lower end of the market? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. First of all, just to play back what I shared at the Investor Day, I said if I had to pick one that was the most important lever going forward, it's go-to-market. We are continuing feverishly to build out the product capabilities that we need on the platform because we don't plan to stop at 100 employees. Our plan is to serve mid-market customers over time that are far larger than 100. However, in the near term, sort of near and midterm, the biggest needle mover is go-to-market. And I would tell you that it continues to be bringing on the right skill sets of talent in sales and marketing. And so even in the last, I think, couple of quarters, it's been -- we've hired a very strong marketing leader. We're -- we've hired a very strong sales leader. We're hiring a couple of more sales leaders. We're bringing on account managers that have a lot of skill in selling and nurturing customers. Because when we think about mid-market, it's really about a lot of the examples I was using earlier, which is really helping customers understand they can run their business in one place on one platform and the benefits of doing so and what it will mean to their cash flow and particularly helping them understand our roadmap as a company and what we are doing with Intuit Assist, which is really creating a feature of done for you with always having a gateway to human expertise. And that's enticing for mid-market customers. So net-net, that's the way I would describe our focus area. But we want you to walk away to be we're continuing to invest in the product and in the platform because that's a big opportunity in the long term as well. In terms of health, I think it really -- it comes down to the sector, if you just use US as an example, comes down to the state, the sector that you're in. Generally speaking, based on our history looking backwards, larger, more tenured customers can withstand more of economic turmoil versus someone that literally just started out their business and they only have $100,000 in their savings and if that $100,000 is spent, then they're done, right, they go bankrupt. So it really depends on the size of the business, how long that they've been in business and then the segment that their business is in, all those variables play in. I wouldn't say younger ones are more or less healthy and the older ones are healthier. I would just say it depends on the components that I just described a moment ago.\nArti Vula: Perfect. Thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Good afternoon. Sasan, maybe we've talked a lot about the Full Service business. And as you look at that business and all the learnings you've talked about, how will you define success for that business at the end of the tax season? Is it the number of returns of process? Is it -- I guess, what are the metrics that you will use to figure if you had success or not?\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thanks for your question. First of all, I'll start with something that's really, really important, and that is the investments that we've made over the years where TurboTax is now one platform, and that platform is built on an incredible rich sort of data layer, AI layer and expert network. and now an ecosystem of apps, which is consumer app and business taxes. And the reason I start there is because now we have the ability in one place for you to do your taxes yourself, get help with an expert that's matched specifically to your needs and we can do your taxes for you. And in fact, you can request the same person to do your taxes for you year in and year out and provide advice along the way. The reason I started with that foundational element that we are one platform is as we go to market and start talking to customers about the notion of that choice with us, and we can do everything for you, it actually creates a halo effect. And so what we will look at are metrics around number of customers, conversion, retention, ARPC across the entire franchise. And we also look at it by area. So very specifically, Full Service plays a very important halo effect because it's an element of confidence. It's actually knowing that if I want to hand everything off to someone that Intuit can now do it for me, whether it's virtually or now locally, if I want to connect to an expert. But ultimately, the metric that will matter the most for Full Service is going to be ARPC because it's not just the numbers game. It's the value of these customers. We, of course, will measure a number of customers and ARPC, but ARPC will have the largest impact to our outcomes this year and in the future because now we do your taxes for you as a consumer and as a business.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. And Sandeep just one quick question. You talked about not wanting to focus on one quarter for margins. But I'm wondering, as you look at the year, any differentiation or movement in marketing especially as the tax season unfolds?\nSandeep Aujla: Kartik, we are continuing to invest across our product, across the Big Bet, across GenAI, across marketing and particularly as we go to Full Service, we want to make sure that we are expanding our brand's equity beyond the DIY category to the Full Service. But I would not expect any meaningful shift in the seasonality of our marketing spend, which I think is the question that you're asking. So -- and I feel pretty good about the campaigns and the investments we've been making across the go-to-market motion across tax as well as the other segments.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you. Yes. That was the question I was asking. I just did a poor job of it. So thank you.\nSasan Goodarzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. Another question here on TurboTax as you're kind of heading into the next tax season here. Now that the focus is more on full service and TurboTax Live, is there something different about the end user, the end consumer filer that you're targeting now, say, going after that CPA segment that's different from traditionally, where you've gone after that tax store, you've had tremendous success there against tax stores. Now that CPA segment. Is there some difference there? And is there some learning from last year in go-to-market that you can apply this year to gain more traction there at that end of the market? Thanks, again.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. And it's actually spot on the way you asked it, and that is we view our opportunity as nearly 100 million customers that are either consumers, which is about 88 million of the 100 million and the rest are our business customers, small businesses. We view our opportunity going after them, which is a combination of small pros, mom-and-pop shops, stores is actually a smaller part of the whole pie. And in the last, I would say, 18 months, we've experimented a lot with how do we go after these customers, how do we raise awareness, how do we get them to consider and ultimately, how do we ensure that when they come to our front door, front door is a service front or not a software front door because of the behaviors that they have. And a lot of those both go-to-market and platform insights and learnings is what has informed a number of things that I touched on earlier that we experimented with and ran test in the tax extension season and what we feel good about going into this coming season. So it was a long answer to your question, but yeah, a lot of those insights have informed our game plan because we're not just the software platform, we're a software and service platform, given who we're focused on serving. And by the way, while I have the floor, the same thing applies to small businesses as we think about what we're doing to embed QuickBooks Live in our offering.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thank you, Sasan.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Very welcome.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. I have a follow-up for Sandeep and then one for you, Sasan. Sandeep, on the margins in the quarter, you cited marketing, which I assume was predominantly that. Was there anything else in the quarter that was beneficial? Or was that the lion's share? And then you mentioned spread over the balance of the year and in Kartik\u2019s answer, I felt you kind of were speaking to TurboTax but it looks like you're expecting a bit of a down quarter on margin in the second quarter. So we'll -- and it seemed like it was mostly in small business, the real benefit in the first quarter. So will that end as of second quarter? Is that truly something that is going to tail off in the second half as well? And then I'll come back to the follow-up. Thanks.\nSandeep Aujla: Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. The way I would think about the Q1, we had multiple expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, and marketing was one of those expense lines, and I would not say that marketing was the lion's share of it. There were several things that we expected will hit us in October that got pushed out, but I would definitely not take away as marketing being the lion's share of items that got pushed out. And you're right, some of those will get caught up, and we'll have those expenses in Q2 and so once you look at Q1 and Q2 spent together, those things will start normalizing out. Again, I'll bring you and the team back to the fact that you should all be focusing on our margins on a full year basis. In any given year, we could have different expense trend lines. So again, we remain confident in our guidance for the full year across the margins for the company.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Appreciate that. And Sasan, we're pretty well along now into Karma Guarantee. Would love just to get an update on that and Credit Karma was a bit stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter. Is it something that could potentially inflect a positive year-over-year growth in the fiscal first half? Or is that something that you'd expect more in the back half? Thanks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with, based on our insights and learnings from last year, we really took an approach to be intentional and prudent about the guidance that we provide, which means taking into account not only a macro environment, but also not just banking, a bunch of initiatives in the back half of the year. We're aggressive in the initiatives that we're working on, but we did not make them into our guidance because we just wanted to be thoughtful and prudent. With that as context, I would -- I love your question about Karma Guarantee because we haven't explicitly been talking about it and it's not because it's not important anymore. It's because of the way we are now thinking about it and incorporating it into several areas. One is you've heard us talk about the entire app redesign, which is far more focused on putting the right benefits in front of the customers at the right time, which we talked about at Investor Day, that coupled with Intuit Assist. And the example I used in earlier was the fact that prime customers spend literally four or five hours doing comparison shopping between credit cards because they can get whatever credit card they want, but they're looking for the perps. Now we can automatically do that for them based on all of the data and everything that we know about them. So you combine the app redesign with Intuit Assist and our focus on prime customers. Karma Guarantee plays an important role helping customers, particularly those that have a hard time getting access to financial products, guarantee them that if they choose what's in front of them that they're going to be approved for it or we'll put $50 in their bank account. So the combination of those things is what the set of initiatives are that we are focused on that we expect will drive engagement, higher frequency and monetization. And we've not included that in our guidance, but it's very important for the future growth of the business. Not only that, and I'll end with this, tax is an enormous part of it. We've now spent several years thinking about how does every interaction and move a customer mix in the Credit Karma platform? How does that inform what that will mean to their taxes. So that when it's tax time, it's a much more seamless experience along with compelling offers. So taxes now, as we look ahead, such an important part of the life of the member and our focus area within Credit Karma. And all of those combined is what we have high hopes for in the future. Again, not in our guidance but important for the future.\nScott Schneeberger: Excellent. Thanks for all that.\nSasan Goodarzi: You're very welcome.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no -- go ahead, sir.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sorry, go ahead.\nOperator: There no further questions, so you may proceed with any additional or closing remarks.\nSasan Goodarzi: Sorry to have interrupted you. I was just going to say thank you for all the questions, and we look forward to hearing from everyone next quarter. Until then, be safe. Bye, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Sandeep Aujla",
            "content": "Thank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $3 billion, up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year. Turning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem, which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment. with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-employed group is threefold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online's accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by Payroll, Mailchimp, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. And within Payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products in October, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1. We -- This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money. Shifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states, both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax. The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season, bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season. Now let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4. As a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax relief. We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. And on the margin question, Keith -- on the margin question, let me start by reiterating our commitment to having our expenses growth lower than revenue and in essence, delivering our margin expansion and operating leverage, which is something that we hold dearly and our guidance of 40 to 60 bps expansion for the year reflects the discipline that we have as a management team. On the margin for the quarter, I would share that, I won't get too fixated on the quarterly number. We had some expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, including some marketing expenses. And as I shared during the prepared remarks, we are committed to our full year guidance on our operating income. So that's what I would guide you and the teams towards. And Brad, what I'll add is beyond just the QuickBooks side, we also are seeing strong progress on the Mailchimp side in terms of mid-market where historically before we acquired the company was not a focus and now with some of the stuff was Sasan mentioned, including account management, better onboarding, we're seeing better customer acquisition on the mid-market as well as better retention year-over-year in the mid-market, so that opportunity extends beyond just the QuickBooks for us across the entire platform, including Mailchimp. Kartik, we are continuing to invest across our product, across the Big Bet, across GenAI, across marketing and particularly as we go to Full Service, we want to make sure that we are expanding our brand's equity beyond the DIY category to the Full Service. But I would not expect any meaningful shift in the seasonality of our marketing spend, which I think is the question that you're asking. So -- and I feel pretty good about the campaigns and the investments we've been making across the go-to-market motion across tax as well as the other segments. Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. The way I would think about the Q1, we had multiple expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, and marketing was one of those expense lines, and I would not say that marketing was the lion's share of it. There were several things that we expected will hit us in October that got pushed out, but I would definitely not take away as marketing being the lion's share of items that got pushed out. And you're right, some of those will get caught up, and we'll have those expenses in Q2 and so once you look at Q1 and Q2 spent together, those things will start normalizing out. Again, I'll bring you and the team back to the fact that you should all be focusing on our margins on a full year basis. In any given year, we could have different expense trend lines. So again, we remain confident in our guidance for the full year across the margins for the company."

            "content": "Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment. With the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live. Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second, is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service, where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season. We believe this is Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform. And with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way. We are creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by GenAI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First, Mailchimp. We're rolling out two new GenAI experiences, designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time. These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I'll share more on those in just a moment. Second, TurboTax. As I shared earlier during the extension season we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy checks and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season. Third, QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we're serving our proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary. These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers. Fourth, Credit Karma. We're testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of five hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history. This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform. Let me now highlight progress across two of our five big bets. As a reminder, our five big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier. Today, easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter. While it's early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers. Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight two of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months. With Intuit Assist, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign. Second, AI-powered marketing automation, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored way. Today, many of our customers don't use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automation, which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product. Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services. We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for education, a new financial literacy program to provide Gen Z and Gen Alpha students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund, providing grants in [Seven-Eye] (ph) solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be one of the only eight Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep. All right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our five big bets and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted adviser, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate at penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With all of that said, let's now open it up to your questions. Yeah. Thank you for your question. And I actually think it's a really interesting question that you're asking in terms of how are we learning across platforms. The short answer is we capture best practices and share the insights on a daily basis across our teams. And in fact, I'll just use our staff as an example. We get weekly slacks with documents that share the best practices, the progress that has been made and how that informs the next week across each of the platforms. And we spend 80% of my staff meeting actually doing product reviews of Intuit Assist. A big large part of it is what the key best practices are, learnings are. And I would tell you that there's a lot of commonality in themes across our learnings across the platform, which actually is simply putting us in a position to accelerate our pivot and our progress and innovation and the timing of going GA across the platform. To your second question, no, we're not impacted by the chip shortage. It does not at all impact our launch plans. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Keith. I'll take your first one. What you're seeing from us in Mailchimp is entirely execution. We're not getting tailwinds from the macro environment. And as I mentioned, when we closed the acquisition a while back, that our biggest opportunity was to be clear about our product improvements, our lineup and to be able to create one growth platform, develop strength internationally and go to mid-market. And by the way, we've made a lot of progress in all of those areas. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, to be clear. But everything that you're seeing is based on our execution and no macro tailwinds. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Siti. As you know, we've been in this macro environment for some time now. And the small businesses that we serve are resilient for a couple of reasons. One, they're on our platform. And by digitizing what they do, which is how they grow customers and managing their cash flow, they are far more resilient and as we've shared before, anybody that's on our platform is nearly 20 points higher in their success rate than those that are not on our platform. So we are part of sort of the health that we're experiencing on our platform. With that as context, I would just share a couple of data points. One, the number of companies and the number of employees that our small businesses are hiring still remains strong. Two, our total online payments volume grew 21%, which means that our small businesses are continuing to be competitive. and -- and serving their consumers. I also remind us, by the way, I think, a year ago or more, that growth was in the 30% plus. And so we have seen an impact, but just our overall platform is very resilient. And then the last thing I would say is that the cash reserves of our small businesses is 90% of where it was this time last year. However, it's 128% of where it was pre-pandemic. So their cash flow is stronger than several years ago, but 10% down from last year. And then very specifically, as you know, we serve service-based businesses, which is about 70% of the market. We're not concentrated in any one particular area. But you'll see place things like auto repairs and -- that are doing well, professional services that are doing well. But just like pure construction, those that do lending not doing well. So there's sort of ups and downs across the small businesses that we see. But in aggregate, the health comes from the numbers that I shared with you. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah, that was really driven by a larger price increase last year versus this year. That was really the only -- the driver. We liked what we saw in terms of our acquisitions, our retention. So that's really the variance. Sorry, can you ask your question again? Yeah. Well, I'll answer your question in two ways. One, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we saw and we anticipated further tightening by our partners. By the way, it happened exactly the same time last year. And so we expected that as a -- our partners prepare for the end of the fiscal year and next year, there would be some further tightening, and that's really what we saw. And that was included in our expectations and in our guidance as we thought about the year. That's number one. Number two, there -- not everything is linear because it depends on the number of days like a month like November based on in the US, based on Thanksgiving week, the number of days that people take off that actually impacts certain behaviors. And so there is no linearity. But the quarter just in total was in line with what we expected. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah, sure. Let me answer your question in two ways because I think they're -- it's a great question, and it's connected. First of all, the biggest insight and learning that we have had is, it's really important to have embedded benefits where the customer is doing the work versus sort of something on the side where the assistant is there to help the customer. So what I mean by that is while a customer is looking to build a marketing campaign right within the flow, we, in essence, help them with the audience they should segment, the audience they should target and then we will build their marketing campaign for them, but with them in complete control. So that's a really -- it may sound really obvious, but it's a really important learning, which, by the way, translates to also what we learned in tax, which is within the flow of helping a customer understand their money outcome, helping them understand and doing accuracy checks for them. And if they miss something, calling it out so they can address it right then and there. Those are examples that, by the way, is consistent across all of our platform workflows where embedded matters a lot. The second is depth, depending on the customer and what they're trying to do, there's a level of depth that they want to go to. So an example is within QuickBooks, one of the things that we've been testing and it's been testing really well is a business summary. And the business summary, in essence, provides what we believe are the most important things that, that customer should know and the customer that engages with those business insights and ultimately, will create reports or ask more questions. What we've learned is we're not building propensity models in terms of the timing of when to connect them to an expert. That's a monetizable event for us because if not, you can go on and on having a Q&A and ultimately not get to the benefit as quickly as possible. So those are major insights and learnings and those insights and learnings have led to how we're thinking about monetization. In the case of Mailchimp, having GenAI SKUs based on the things that we can do for customers automatically on their behalf. In the case of QuickBooks and by the way, TurboTax it's a monetizable event because it's a gateway to human expertise and expert help. And then we will be testing GenAI specific SKUs also in QuickBooks. So those are illustrative examples of based on the benefits that we're learning about what's important to customers, that then informs how we think about price testing. And so far, we're pleased with what we're learning and how fast we're pivoting as a company. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah, sure. Let me answer your question on two dimensions. One, there was a macro element, which there were just more filers in the extension season than we anticipated, both by the way, states that extended and states that did not extend. And these are more complex filers and it's actually our sweet spot. It's why we were able to take share in this extension season. And so that's one element of what drove our better-than-expected results. The three areas that we're excited about, these have been durable priorities where we did a lot of tests and experiments and got a lot of green shoots and learnings that will lead into this coming tax season, it's Credit Karma platform, it's TurboTax Live and its Intuit Assist. And I'll briefly touch on each of them. Within the Credit Karma platform, we have more seamlessly built out the tax experience, whether you want to do it yourself or you want somebody to do it for you. And we've been -- we've developed very compelling SKUs within the Credit Karma platform, which having the opportunity to serve 42 million monthly active users that engage five times a month, was not only a great product, but a great set of SKUs. we saw green shoots and we're excited about that as we look at. The second is TurboTax Live. We expanded the scale of our data, AI and expert network. What that means is, and I'll just point out in two areas. One is the fact that for many customers that want to hand off all their taxes to us, we can get their taxes done within an hour. And that's a very big deal to be able to engage an expert, have your data available and get their taxes done in one setting and then also being able to serve business tax customers, which we'll be launching at scale. Those were areas of green shoots. And the last is Intuit Assist. Two big areas. One is accuracy checks and making sure that in place, we help the customer, in essence, correct something that we believe is a mistake. That's a big conversion driver, by the way. And then the second is just explaining refunds, explaining their money outcome, which is all done and driven by Intuit Assist leveraging our knowledge engineering capabilities and our GenAI capabilities. So those are the three things along with the macro where we saw green shoots that give us a lot of confidence as we head into season. Very welcome. What was your last question, bill pay? Yeah. Got it. Thanks for the question. So I'll start with Mailchimp. As we talked about, one of our top priorities includes international. We've spent quite a bit of time and investment in translating to local languages, building out a team that can focus on EMEA and third, making sure that we've got the right pricing lineup and go-to-market plan. And we're executing against that. We like what we see. And it's contributing to the numbers that we reported. And I would say, for us, it's the balance of focus between US and international. We see an enormous opportunity in US and in international. So we have the right balance focus as we think about the geographies. The second, in terms of cross-sell as we shared at Investor Day, we are a big part of the thesis behind the acquisition was to create one growth platform. And what we shared at Investor Day was that we are building an AI native CRM within the QuickBooks platform. We're continuing to make progress in testing and learning and pivoting to get the product market fit. When we get the product market fit. That's really where the cross-sell takes place. We've not assumed or anticipated any contribution from that in our guidance this year. But it's a very important long-term strategic priority. It's the reason why we acquired the platform is to ultimately have one growth platform where you can grow your customers and manage our cash flow all in one place. So that's on the Mailchimp front. On Bill Pay, we're pleased with the fact that we're GA and we -- and as I think noted earlier, what we're seeing with our mid-market customers is -- mid-market versus non-mid market customers, there's a 2x increase in those that are taking the subscription, the paid subscription. So that just means that we're adding value. We also have work ahead of us in Bill pay, things around batch payments, faster funding, all the things that we know we have to have. It's on our roadmap, and it will be launched in the future. So along with the fact that we're GA, we're clear on what the gaps are and what -- and it's on our roadmap, we're working feverishly to really be able to digitize B2B for our customers because we believe it's a big opportunity for our customers to improve their cash flow and a big growth opportunity for us in the long term. So that's the progress on both fronts. Yeah. You're very welcome. Yeah, great question. I'll share two different perspectives in terms of what we're seeing. The first one is, it really doesn't matter what the economic environment is. If it's great, they don't behave differently. If it's challenging like it is now, they don't behave differently. We certainly don't see them -- any of our customers wanting not to switch because the economy is not good, which leads to the second point I wanted to make. So the headline on the first question is, it's not a tailwind or a headwind, whether it's good times or bad times. However, what I would say is we see some green shoots that's early when we do bundling for our customers. When we go to our customers and share with them that they can digitize all of their payments, all of their payroll and the benefits that it will have for our customers from a cash flow perspective, we see that having traction with our customers. And as we've continued to build out our sales team, we're doing, I think, a far better job of account management. And this is an area where if you look back five years ago, we didn't have the kind of value-added account management teams that we're building now where we're engaging our customers, they're are hearing from us, right? We've been entirely a [self-sell] (ph) platform. And now that we're engaging our customers, a lot of them are starting to realize, wow, you have payments, I didn't realize you have payroll. I didn't you have time tracking. I didn't realize your own Mailchimp. And that is an opportunity for us to drive an increased penetration in wallet share. So I share that just to say that's where we're getting traction. That's where we're seeing progress, and that's where we see an opportunity as we look ahead. You're very welcome. Yeah, Kirk, the short answer is, it's early, but we're seeing green shoots, and it's primarily because of what I shared just a moment ago, as we're building out our account management team across Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, as we're talking to our customers, and in fact, I personally spoke to three of them in the last month that are very large mid-market customers, two of them in LA and one of them in Miami. And it actually starts with -- they didn't know even know we have, Payments, Payroll. They didn't even know we're the same company that owns Mailchimp as an example. Some of them will use Mailchimp but they'll use QuickBooks. Some of them use our Payroll, but don't use our Payments and so the thing that we're inspired by and where we believe there's a big opportunity is the fact that we actually have a huge differentiation, which is around data, AI and network of experts and an ecosystem of applications. And the applications are all the things that a small business would want. And our account management team is really discovering for us the fact that our customers just don't know. And so therefore, we engage them, build relationships and talk about the benefits of all of our applications and then what could be done based on all of the capabilities that we have around AI and how that could fuel their success. That's what's really opening up doors for us is just the unknown. And that's what we're excited about as we continue to accelerate building out our talent management team. So I think the long answer to your short question is, yes, customers would prefer to be on one platform. And what we're learning is a lot of customers are not because they just actually don't even know what we do holistically, and that's the mission that we are on. Yeah, you're very welcome. Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. First of all, just to play back what I shared at the Investor Day, I said if I had to pick one that was the most important lever going forward, it's go-to-market. We are continuing feverishly to build out the product capabilities that we need on the platform because we don't plan to stop at 100 employees. Our plan is to serve mid-market customers over time that are far larger than 100. However, in the near term, sort of near and midterm, the biggest needle mover is go-to-market. And I would tell you that it continues to be bringing on the right skill sets of talent in sales and marketing. And so even in the last, I think, couple of quarters, it's been -- we've hired a very strong marketing leader. We're -- we've hired a very strong sales leader. We're hiring a couple of more sales leaders. We're bringing on account managers that have a lot of skill in selling and nurturing customers. Because when we think about mid-market, it's really about a lot of the examples I was using earlier, which is really helping customers understand they can run their business in one place on one platform and the benefits of doing so and what it will mean to their cash flow and particularly helping them understand our roadmap as a company and what we are doing with Intuit Assist, which is really creating a feature of done for you with always having a gateway to human expertise. And that's enticing for mid-market customers. So net-net, that's the way I would describe our focus area. But we want you to walk away to be we're continuing to invest in the product and in the platform because that's a big opportunity in the long term as well. In terms of health, I think it really -- it comes down to the sector, if you just use US as an example, comes down to the state, the sector that you're in. Generally speaking, based on our history looking backwards, larger, more tenured customers can withstand more of economic turmoil versus someone that literally just started out their business and they only have $100,000 in their savings and if that $100,000 is spent, then they're done, right, they go bankrupt. So it really depends on the size of the business, how long that they've been in business and then the segment that their business is in, all those variables play in. I wouldn't say younger ones are more or less healthy and the older ones are healthier. I would just say it depends on the components that I just described a moment ago. Yeah, very welcome. Yeah. Thanks for your question. First of all, I'll start with something that's really, really important, and that is the investments that we've made over the years where TurboTax is now one platform, and that platform is built on an incredible rich sort of data layer, AI layer and expert network. and now an ecosystem of apps, which is consumer app and business taxes. And the reason I start there is because now we have the ability in one place for you to do your taxes yourself, get help with an expert that's matched specifically to your needs and we can do your taxes for you. And in fact, you can request the same person to do your taxes for you year in and year out and provide advice along the way. The reason I started with that foundational element that we are one platform is as we go to market and start talking to customers about the notion of that choice with us, and we can do everything for you, it actually creates a halo effect. And so what we will look at are metrics around number of customers, conversion, retention, ARPC across the entire franchise. And we also look at it by area. So very specifically, Full Service plays a very important halo effect because it's an element of confidence. It's actually knowing that if I want to hand everything off to someone that Intuit can now do it for me, whether it's virtually or now locally, if I want to connect to an expert. But ultimately, the metric that will matter the most for Full Service is going to be ARPC because it's not just the numbers game. It's the value of these customers. We, of course, will measure a number of customers and ARPC, but ARPC will have the largest impact to our outcomes this year and in the future because now we do your taxes for you as a consumer and as a business. Thank you. Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. And it's actually spot on the way you asked it, and that is we view our opportunity as nearly 100 million customers that are either consumers, which is about 88 million of the 100 million and the rest are our business customers, small businesses. We view our opportunity going after them, which is a combination of small pros, mom-and-pop shops, stores is actually a smaller part of the whole pie. And in the last, I would say, 18 months, we've experimented a lot with how do we go after these customers, how do we raise awareness, how do we get them to consider and ultimately, how do we ensure that when they come to our front door, front door is a service front or not a software front door because of the behaviors that they have. And a lot of those both go-to-market and platform insights and learnings is what has informed a number of things that I touched on earlier that we experimented with and ran test in the tax extension season and what we feel good about going into this coming season. So it was a long answer to your question, but yeah, a lot of those insights have informed our game plan because we're not just the software platform, we're a software and service platform, given who we're focused on serving. And by the way, while I have the floor, the same thing applies to small businesses as we think about what we're doing to embed QuickBooks Live in our offering. Yeah. Very welcome. Yeah. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with, based on our insights and learnings from last year, we really took an approach to be intentional and prudent about the guidance that we provide, which means taking into account not only a macro environment, but also not just banking, a bunch of initiatives in the back half of the year. We're aggressive in the initiatives that we're working on, but we did not make them into our guidance because we just wanted to be thoughtful and prudent. With that as context, I would -- I love your question about Karma Guarantee because we haven't explicitly been talking about it and it's not because it's not important anymore. It's because of the way we are now thinking about it and incorporating it into several areas. One is you've heard us talk about the entire app redesign, which is far more focused on putting the right benefits in front of the customers at the right time, which we talked about at Investor Day, that coupled with Intuit Assist. And the example I used in earlier was the fact that prime customers spend literally four or five hours doing comparison shopping between credit cards because they can get whatever credit card they want, but they're looking for the perps. Now we can automatically do that for them based on all of the data and everything that we know about them. So you combine the app redesign with Intuit Assist and our focus on prime customers. Karma Guarantee plays an important role helping customers, particularly those that have a hard time getting access to financial products, guarantee them that if they choose what's in front of them that they're going to be approved for it or we'll put $50 in their bank account. So the combination of those things is what the set of initiatives are that we are focused on that we expect will drive engagement, higher frequency and monetization. And we've not included that in our guidance, but it's very important for the future growth of the business. Not only that, and I'll end with this, tax is an enormous part of it. We've now spent several years thinking about how does every interaction and move a customer mix in the Credit Karma platform? How does that inform what that will mean to their taxes. So that when it's tax time, it's a much more seamless experience along with compelling offers. So taxes now, as we look ahead, such an important part of the life of the member and our focus area within Credit Karma. And all of those combined is what we have high hopes for in the future. Again, not in our guidance but important for the future. You're very welcome. Sorry, go ahead. Sorry to have interrupted you. I was just going to say thank you for all the questions, and we look forward to hearing from everyone next quarter. Until then, be safe. Bye, everybody."
