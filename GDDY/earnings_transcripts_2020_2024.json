I\u2019m Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks by Aman and Ray, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions.

With that, here\u2019s Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Mark and thank you all for joining us. Go Daddy exists to empower everyday entrepreneurs. Our mission is to make opportunity inclusive for all and the shift to digital represents the greatest opportunity for our customers to share their gifts with the world. With a differentiated offering, including guidance and tools within intuitive seamless experience, specifically designed and built for our customers, it is clear like customers continue to adopt our products and ask us for more. Everyday entrepreneurs are creative and resourceful and they want to be able to focus their time on their business from domain names email and content creation to commerce and soon they include payments and point-of-sale. Customer focus for us is about building a seamlessly intuitive experience that saves them time and unlocks capabilities through ease of use. In 2020, our digital presence was key for our customers and the increased demand led to accelerating bookings growth for the last three quarters for us. For 2020, GoDaddy neared $3.8 billion in booking and topped $3.3 billion in revenue. We leaned into the surge in demand with marketing spend and while we kept it efficient, the result was our best year of net customer ads except 2017, which included the HG [ph] acquisition. We welcomed nearly 1.4 million net new customers in 2020 by providing valuable products and offering the best care. We've also been able to maintain stable renewal rates and our churn metrics, well those have always been low and they still found room to improve in 2020. Early last year we spoke about our natural evolution into commerce. Everyday entrepreneurs are underserved and demanded from us and our investments have been focused on the simplest and most relevant commerce experience. No doubt commerce continue to be a giant opportunity for us. Internally, we are also evolving. We have made significant progress in implementing a broader experimentation program that allows us to more clearly measure the value we are creating for customers and deliver functionality faster. The discipline of measurement allows us to set more ambitious goals while also giving us the confidence to achieve them. We are moving faster, putting more products in the hands of more customers and winning the right to do more for them. Our leadership team is also evolving. 2020 was a year of milestone and clearly defining achievements for many GoDaddy leaders. After having truly accomplished herculean tasks both in 2020 and over their respective careers, our Chief Legal Officer, Nima Kelly and our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Winborne have each expressed a desire to retire at some point this year. They continue to be fully engaged with the company and will help with transition as we look to fill that incredibly big shoes. We have a strong leadership team with talented, tenured folks and with continued leadership from [indiscernible], we expect a seamless transition. We have strong internal candidates and we will be looking for external candidates for both roles as well. With acceleration in the number and also in our internal operating rhythm, I want to share three priority areas where GoDaddy will be bringing innovative solutions to our customers in 2021. Our top priority is commerce and 2021 is the year we will bring to market a holistic solution for everyday entrepreneurs that powers every facet of their online and offline commerce experience. In 2020, we created strong customer value with our commerce tools and GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite grew 75% year-over-year. In 2021, GoDaddy will extend our current operating with a focus on delivering Omni-commerce solutions. Earlier this week, we closed on the Poynt acquisition and as you know Poynt extend our commerce offering with a set of products that span the full spectrum of commerce enablement. Poynt brings us payment capabilities as a payment facilitator and bring immense value to our customers through its innovative point of sale terminal, inventory management software, loyalty management tool and more. Poynt and Go Daddy customers are already seeing great success, represented by the combined $23 billion in annualized GMV that already flows through our platforms as we integrate and build the Go Daddy commerce platform it's scale will be backed by the 6,000 guides that are ready to provide guidance we know our customers need. To help drive focus and continued momentum in commerce, we have created a new commerce division within Go Daddy. Poynt CEO, Osama Bedier has joined Go Daddy and will leave this new division reporting to me. The next priority I want to share is about our pro customer. We already have a large group of designers and developers that are Go Daddy customers, but we know the opportunity is much, much larger. Last year our partners whose sole focus is to create value for designers and developers went back to first principle. Deep research into the customer needs led to a new set of solutions organized in three pillars. The first pillar is all about a seamless intuitive experience in the tools that we offer. In January we launched the hub for Go Daddy pros where website designers and developers can perform their work in a simple intuitive way that saves them time and money. The hub enables bulk updates across hundreds of sites for WordPress, plug-ins and Themes allowing pros to roll out updates for better security, new functionality and better availability. What may have taken hours now takes seconds and even works on WordPress sites now hosted by Go Daddy. Pros can also use the hubs built in project management tools and make it easier than ever to deliver customized sites for their clients. The hub let's pros manage all of their [indiscernible] in one place and built-in delegated access allows pros to collaborate with their clients more effectively to drive the results their customers want to see. The second pillar is all about care. Pros have told us that they value the kind of guidance and care we offer and they want us to do more. We have extended our care to support pros for all their WordPress sites, not just the ones that host with us. With additional care guides armed with a high level of training to support these pros, we are ready for the unique needs of this customer population. The third pillar to bring that altogether through marketing, with millions of pros out there, we have planned a marketing launch to tell them about the added value and capabilities we are bringing forward. It all begins with the laws of the Go Daddy Pro program. Signing up to be a Go Daddy Pro gets pros access to exclusive discounts for themselves and for their clients and direct access to the most advanced guide directly through the hub speaking their language exactly the way they wanted. Go Daddy Pro is live in the US with its first marketing campaign and in April, we will be hosting our first virtual Go Daddy Pro conference and we're just getting started. Lookout for more benefits of being a Go Daddy Pro and its global launch. The three pillars together embrace the needs of our Pro customers and enhance our relationship with them beyond a strong managed WordPress offering. Overall, our strategy is straight forward. WordPress is the largest CMS in the world with a market share of over 60% and growing. Pros know WordPress and prefer WordPress and our vision is all about making a seamless and intuitive while retaining all its power and flexibility. We are not interested in forcing pros to use a different tool. That sounds like a job participant. While it is exciting to talk about new offerings like commerce and Go Daddy Pro, under these exciting new businesses, is the solid foundation of our domains business and that is the third priority I want to talk to you about. Clear as we have outgrown the domains industry with innovative ideas and execution in both the primary and secondary market. That growth isn't going away anytime soon. Recently, we added Go Daddy corporate domain and Go Daddy registry, which promise to offer new and existing customers with innovative solutions, but that isn\u2019t all. Our client team has really stepped up their experimentation velocity. These are the folks that run the search algorithm on Go Daddy.com. We are building an adaptive user experience, which leverages multiple inputs including the customer's profile, liquidity, it's context, the available results and also available add-on to make sure customers see the options and bundle that will create the most value. Our aftermarket has also seeing tailwinds from the digital transformation of small business. More businesses coming online is resulting in more customers leveraging our domain broker service to help them secure the perfect name for their online presence, even if someone else already owns it. Our new list for sales rule has also seen an incredible first inning. This tool let's customers with unused domain names, list them in our aftermarket and in just three months, we've seen over 350,000 domains get listed. The outcome here is a continued acceleration in this business as more customers are matched with better offerings and are exposed to attach opportunity as well. Most of the financial impact of this accelerating innovation and domains is still to come and we are confident that the outperformance we have seen in this category will continue well beyond 2021. At our scale, innovation like this, not only drives growth, but also helps one exciting new initiatives across the business. I look forward to sharing more on the three priorities I just went through as the year progresses. Before I wrap up, I know that many of you are eager to hear about the results of our websites plus marketing freemium offering. In less than a year, it has shown itself to be an area of real promise for Go Daddy. Beginning in the spring of 2020, we conducted a small-scale experiment presenting our freemium offering to a limited number of visitors. Over the course of the year, we steadily increased the number of US base visitors that would see this offering to approximately 50% and we are pleased with the results we've seen along the way. Millions of sign-ups and solid conversion rates that we're happy to note are higher than what we had seen elsewhere in the industry. There is certainly more to be done and this is an exciting outcome as we work to make freemium a tailwind to our business for years to come. Looking at 2021, while there are many unknowns and many things we plan to accomplish, we continue to see evidence in our business that supports aggressive forward momentum. As Ray will share through focused execution, Go Daddy delivered a strong result in 2020 in the face of many challenges. Our core strategy of creating value for customers and converting it to shareholder value over time is working. We are evolving as a company and are in a fantastic spot as we enter into 2021. With that, here is Ray.\nRay Winborne: Thanks Aman. I'll touch on the fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for 2021. Despite the operational challenges caused by the pandemic, we delivered a strong performance in 2020. We added 1.4 million net new customers, nearly double the number added in 2019. This was complemented by a decrease in our already low customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewal rates as our products and services became even more valuable to our customers. Full year revenue grew 11% year-over-year while our free cash flow was up 12%, even as we invested more marketing to capture higher demand in the market. We also took advantage of the opportunities created by the uncertainty deploying $1.8 billion capital adding capabilities for customers and creating value for shareholders. Turning to the fourth quarter results, we saw continued acceleration in topline. Bookings grew $943 million rising 13% year-over-year reported in constant currency basis as FX had little impact on the quarter. Growth was broad-based with continued strength across product categories. Revenue came in at $874 million outperforming expectations and growing 12% year-over-year. Business applications was again our fastest growing product line, increasing 20% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. Domains accelerated to 14% growth as new registrations, renewals and aftermarket sales remained strong along with a modest contribution from Go Daddy registry and finally, hosting new presence grew over 5% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see terrific growth in our website creation platform products. Through the strength was tempered somewhat of the headwinds from the Go Daddy social service due to elimination of the outbound sales motion in June. The key metrics underlying our growth remain consistently strong, ARPU rose to $166 up 5% year-over-year while the customer base grew 7%. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $181 million and $825 million for the full-year. This reflected good operating leverage in the P&L as well as reduced capital expenditures for corporate real estate and infrastructure as we transition more workloads to the cloud. Gross margin remained in the mid-60s in the quarter consistent with our expectations. We continue to ramp investment in marketing to capture increasing demand, resulting in a $40 million year-over-year increase in marketing expense. As we mentioned last quarter, we've been to elevate investment while remaining within our targeted return metrics, even as we saw increased competition and performance advertising channels. On the balance sheet, we finished the year with $765 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. Net debt landed at $2.4 billion putting net leverage at 2.6 times on a trailing 12 month basis, illustrating our ability to deleverage quickly. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet, enabling us to execute across our capital allocation priorities. During 2020, we completed four acquisitions, repurchase nearly 6% of our outstanding equity and average prices substantially today stock price and settled the TRA at an attractive valuation, removing an overhang to stop. All proof points that we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunity as it arises. Rest assured, we'll continue to be proven allocators of capital in the pursuit of long-term growth and levered free cash flow per share. As we look to the future, continued growth and cash flow a strong balance sheet will provide us with the flexibility to deploy roughly $5 billion in capital through 2023. Moving on to our outlook for 2021, we expect to deliver revenue of approximately $3.7 billion representing growth of 12% versus 2020. From a product category perspective, we expect double-digit growth in domains, high single-digit growth in hosting new presence and high teens growth in business applications. This guidance includes $20 million in revenue we expect from the recent acquisition of Poynt. As for Q1, we started the year off on pace and expect to deliver revenue of $885 million represented a 12% growth versus last year. We expect 2021 unlevered free cash flow of approximately $945 million or 15% growth versus 2020. This guidance reflects continued investment in marketing and product plus $20 million in net delusion from Poynt as we build out our capabilities in commerce this year. Finally, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points for the full-year 2021. We expect bookings to grow at a rate similar to revenue and normalized EBITDA margin to be roughly flat as compared to 2020. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, income tax benefits of $25 million and cash interest payments of $100 million based on current debt outstanding in today's forward rate expectations. We announced my retirement today and I want to thank all of you who have been along for the ride. I've had an incredibly rewarding career and to have blessed to have been able to top it off at Go Daddy. It's been my privilege to serve with this amazing group of people dedicated to such a noble mission. We navigated a lot of change as Go Daddy has evolved into a truly customer-centric company, obsessed with creating value for customers, employees and shareholders. This last year was challenging for a lot of people, but also very rewarding as I've been able to witness our leadership team taking bold, decisiveness and strategically sound actions that help our customers employees through an incredibly turbulent year. As to what's next, I plan to be deeply engaged in the search for a successor and I'll stay on to ensure a smooth transition. I look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from IR team open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks Ray. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Thanks Christie and Ray congrats on the decision. We'll miss you that we have a few quarters and happy new year Aman. I wanted to ask a few questions maybe Aman on commerce that was the first pillar that you mentioned as a focus area with Poynt now websites and marketing adoption of the millions, I think new EC templates, I think our $23 billion in GMV, $7 billion of which through website and marketing. Can you talk to just a little more how you view ecommerce unfolding across Go Daddy going forward. The tools appear to be in place, you got the scale. So what's next? And then Ray, just real quick on the guidance with EBITDA flat year-over-year and I'm assuming that's continued investment in marketing and product, is that the way to think about it, thank you?\nAman Bhutani: Ron, thanks for the question and yes, commerce continues to be our number one priority and you're right, you laid it out really well with websites plus marketing in place, Sellbrite also growing quickly, which you didn't mention, also huge opportunity for us in the WooCommerce space, we haven't talked about that much but you know about the SkyVerge acquisition that is helping us bring a program that we call a new Woo, that we'll talk about in the future as well. So yes,, all those things coming together Poynt adding those core capabilities as a payments facilitator invoicing point of sale and the idea is to bring all those pieces together and continue the pace of acceleration. If you just look at GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite, the annualized number we gave you last quarter was much lower than the one you're seeing today and that itself represents quarter-over-quarter acceleration.\nRay Winborne: Ron it's Ray. Appreciate the kind words first, but our normalized EBITDA margin were holding that flat year-over-year, which we're pretty pleased with given the investment we're going to put in place. Both in products, Poynt will be a big piece of that. I mentioned in the call comments that we've got net delusional about $20 million around commerce and we'll continue to invest more in marketing this year as well. So those are the two big drivers our normalized EBITDA margin.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey guys, thanks for the question and I echo the sentiment on Ray congrats. I am assuming that even big shoes to fill. I guess a couple questions, so first if we could just Aman you gave some good commentary on Prohub. Maybe if you could talk about the go to market strategy, I guess marketing around that, how the sales and customer service team will help drive that initiative and can you also talk about how many pros versus the outliers are using your services today. So maybe a little bit more just big picture around how that evolves. And then you domains I think outperformed and you talked a little bit about some of what's driving that. So how is the Neustar acquisition, the synergies you're seeing there, how much is that contributing? Can you talk about some of the things that you put in place specifically from that acquisition and how that can add to growth in the coming years?\nAman Bhutani: Happy to take that, on pros, let's start with the numbers because I think that was in the middle of your question. We have about 1.5 million pros as part of our 21 million customers. So we already have a lot of pros that engage with us on a daily basis. We know that the opportunity is much, much larger and what the pro hub is about is it was about going to the pro scene, what do you guys need in terms of the interface and then building that in a manner that works best for them. And the go to market strategy around it, the Go Daddy program that at all about pro signing up and getting benefits, benefits that over time grow and there is a marketing campaign now in place in the US that is getting word out to say, hey, here is all the new things, the new experience where you can do a whole lot, you got project management tools, you got care with a click through messaging that our guides in the background, there are more guides in number. They have higher level of training and they can execute on more acts from the pros than ever before because we've opened up the aperture of what they can do. So it's the combination of both -- of all of those things that we're really excited about and then in terms of sales and marketing, no doubt care will continue to play a role there, but this is not an outbound motion and what we're really seeing is that pros want to engage with us on the web, they want to engage with care through messaging, they want to move things quickly, They don't even want to wait two minutes for a base load. They don't want to spend hours updating their sites. They want it done in one click and those are the type of capabilities we're opening up here. And then on domains, Ray will take the sort of contribution for Neustar, but just to remind you and it's still super early for us with Neustar, the innovation that we plan to bring to the table is all about having the full stack, being able to innovate on the registry side and the registrar side and bring new offerings and talked about that a little bit in the past. So I'll turn it to Ray to just talk about synergies and contribution as you asked.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, Aman hit it on the head. This was more about the strategy and verticalization on domains. This is a future benefit to us as we get more control over the domain costs, which is one of our largest cost in the P&L. You think about contribution to the topline Ygal, the purchase accounting impacts from Neustar absolutely muted the impacts on the top line. If you're looking year-over-year, '21 contribution inorganic contributions for Neustar are going to be roughly half a point on the topline.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer and Company. Jason, please go ahead.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks, kind of want to ask about acquisition and then leverage. So first point with a very strategic even acquisition but not particularly expensive. If we think relative to free cash flow you guys generate a year, if we think about kind of your acquisition pipeline, would you say more of the acquisitions look like point in site or are you potentially looking at something that might be bigger and then if not bigger, again given the amount of free cash flow you generate and how the company is very well positioned you're seeing very good customer retention. Why not leverage particularly in this environment we thought was the number one question we get investors, why not run this business at 3.5 to 4 times leverage and just accelerate kind of the free cash flow per share return to shareholders, thanks?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Jason. Maybe I'll start and Ray can comment at the end of that. One, I love the idea that you agree that the point is strategically important acquisition and it wasn't very expensive. Those are great acquisitions, I love them but to answer your question, we are looking at the who spectrum Jason. We absolutely agree that many of the core part of our strategy it's in my DNA, it's in the company's DNA. We're good at it. We've done it before but as we're out there looking at the assets as you know it's a competitive or sort of difficult time in the marketplace and we're trying to make sure that the assets we look at truly form part of the advantage we want to create because at the end of the day, what we're looking to have is that simple, intuitive experience. So there is million things I talk about Ray. I'm talking about ease-of-use. I'm talking about saving people time. I'm talking about product interfaces of that truly are magical that lead to high NPS and all the acquisitions we're doing or looking at big or small have to fit into that full. So I wouldn't have anyone think that we're not interested in large acquisitions. We absolutely are, but just we've got a formula we're working it and should be opportunity to you'll find us at the table and Ray, I'll turn it to you for levering up and such.\nRay Winborne: Yeah Jason when you think about leverage, right, we've had a targeted two to four tons leverage since we've been public and we've been at the very top of that range when the opportunity presented itself and we've been more about balancing our capital allocation priorities. You saw every flavor of it in 2020. We leaned in the marketing, put a lot of money into organic growth because the opportunity presented itself. We closed on four acquisitions last year. We bought back stock and we also settled the TRA's. So we're really using that cash flow that incredibly strong and consistent cash flow that you talked about to drive significant returns for the company. And we do see the opportunity to Aman's point, we're certainly not hesitant to take our leverage to four times.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Glaser from JPMorgan. Drew, please go ahead.\nDrew Glaser: Hey this is Drew on for Sterling, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on how much of the 2021 revenue growth is coming from acquisition?\nRay Winborne: Hey Drew, it's Ray, when you look at the inorganic contribution on an incremental basis in '21, it's about a Poynt right. $20 million or so that's coming from Poynt, I just mentioned on I think it was a Ygal's question earlier that Neustar is about another half a point there. So those are the two big biggies that are contributing and it's around that one point contribution.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead.\nNick Jones: One on premium, as you announced visitors for the site and people are converting to the premium offering, is there time to enter the freemium and eventually convert and then I guess when is some of the timing to conversion for freemium as they kind of when they convert to the site.\nAman Bhutani: Nick, the question wasn\u2019t totally clear, but I think I caught most of it. On freemium, what we're seeing is that customers do come in and the metrics we're looking at includes seven-day conversion and 90-day conversion right. There isn\u2019t naturally fixed number of where everyone makes a decision. You continues to see a sort of the tale of people converting over time. Both the seven-day and 90-day, especially as we got into later in the year on the 90-day conversion, we started to have a few cohorts that were reasonable site and we continue to sort of see stable conversion in that 90-days rheum which is what we talked about. In terms of I didn\u2019t fully catch this part of your question, but I think the objective of freemium for us is to open up the aperture to allow our customers without friction to try our products but we fundamentally believe that whether you look at websites plus marketing or Sellbrite, which we also turned freemium last year, the value that customers get compared to the price that we charge, really there is a tremendous amount of value and we want to remove any hesitation customers have of trying to use those products. These products are built from the ground up to the exact needs of our customers and we if feel we open up the aperture and get more customers to try that over time it's just going to build a greater and greater battery that leaves to better financial outcomes over time.\nNick Jones: And one follow-up on M&A, you laid out dream create manage, we like that growing probably the pipeline is and where you're trying to focus in terms of essential M&A across the trends you laid out?\nAman Bhutani: Our priorities on M&A are aligned with our broader priorities as a company and those priorities simply we are the leader in Dream and we absolutely have some intention there. We're making great progress in creating, that's fantastic, but we're putting disproportion about the time and energy resources integral and that's how our M&A team is prioritizing as well because actually create and grow off are more and more working together and that's a massive opportunity and when we talk about our $180 billion TAM, a huge percentage of that is within the growth phase. So that's where the majority of our energy is.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead.\nAaron Kessler: Maybe just on Q4 and that's at $1.4 million or so for the year. Any color on Q4 and that's maybe the linearity of the quarter and then also maybe for Ray and congrats you're taking some time off here and then the cloud transition maybe any updates on that and how this incremental cost was kind of a dual sourcing right now as well if you can lay that out, thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Hey Aaron, I'll take both of those and Mark you can chip something. When you look at Q4 customer growth, still seeing record type levels. The momentum has been good and momentum has carried on into January. So nothing different in the trajectory that we've been seen at point. With cloud you saw some of the impact of cloud in 2020, showing or manifesting itself in lower capital expenditures because we have continued to move workloads into the cloud, that is pressure on the second outline, that's one of the investments we're making there, but if you recall back when we signed our contract with AWS, we were going to manage this thing to a cash basis and that's what we are continuing to do and that's one of the reasons we use unlevered free cash flow as our key metric there because the balance from normalized EBITDA down there, obviously includes the CapEx versus the OpEx up in the P&L.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Aman, just a follow-up on your freemium comment, is it safe to say that the 90-day conversion you hope to do, hope to improve upon and if so what potentially are the missing pieces there and point can help and then appreciate the commentary in your presentation highlighting returns on your marketing spend last year. Just curious how those compared to the prior year and as you look into '21 sort of what consideration you're making in terms of absolute or relative spend and how Poynt perhaps fits into that picture, thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, let me take freemium and a little bit on the marketing spend and perhaps Ray wants to comment on that as well. On freemium, I actually go back to the comments Mark that in the prepared comments, what we're seeing in terms of conversion is a rate that's higher than what we've seen in the industry. So of course it's still early in the journey for us, but that's really good, that's really comforting, it's what's the concerns that people may have had. But when I look at being able to improve conversion over time, absolutely we have people dedicated to doing that, but for me, the biggest things is I want to get it out broader and broader and broader right. I'd like to have it at a 100% in the US soon. I'd like to go global with it and that's what I'm really pushing the team because we know that at the end of the day, it's about attracting more people to our products and getting them to use our products because once they use our products, people see that we have something differentiated offer that it works in a manner that they didn't fully understand that Go Daddy would have that offering. And then in terms of marketing, Ray can talk a little bit about the numbers and the unit economics and how we've continued to sort of maintain our benchmarks and wants to break even, but I'd like to give you a little context of how I think about and the marketing spend and the approach there is one of there you want to spend up in marketing and have you spend up you have to continually improve your measurement, your ability to get into more and more channels and as you do that and you improve your internal capabilities to market better, you can then spend even more in marketing and I've talked about sort of this idea of improvement in growth and improvement in spend in the path and it's something that I have experienced with and I am pretty pleased with what I'm seeing in terms of Go Daddy in 2020 and what we have forecasted for 2021.\nRay Winborne: Yeah I think as you look at what we've been spending on marketing, it's roughly 13% of revenue in 2020, but it's discipline right. We're disciplined in approach, we're disciplined in the execution of delivering the P&L and the P&L we've got a really good track record of investing in marketing over time with good returns and the strong unit economics that we've got. And we've trend with the team to stretch and look at the next marginal customer at an acceptable return that is all about balance. But when we do see that, we extend to pay that period and that does create more risk or higher risk profile for us because it does hit the bottom line in the short term but for the right paybacks we are willing to do that. You might notice in those slides that we put out with the earnings, we've put a new slide in for marketing with a different lens on how we see the returns. So we'll take a look at that but in summary, we did roughly $0.85 in incremental bookings and $0.45 in incremental gross profit in 2020 for every dollar that we spent on marketing and advertising. So when you compare that against other in the industry, that's going to shape up pretty well.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: This is John on behalf of Brent Thill, thank you. When you look at the newer products, websites plus marketing and manage work risk, then when you think about what's the relative sizing in growth rate size you seem it's achievable?\nAman Bhutani: I'll give you a kind of a view into those website creation of products last quarter with an ARR of $350 million growing in the high 30s. We've continued to see strong growth in both of those metrics.\nUnidentified Analyst: Is there a way to differentiate between the two if it's an indication between the core and DIY at all?\nRay Winborne: Both are doing strongly. Obviously we've put a lot more shouldering the websites and marketing recently. You heard Aman's comments earlier. One of the things we would point that is going to help us there is continue to push on commerce which will stretch into the manage WordPress and ecommerce offering as well.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: A couple of questions if I may. In terms of just your outlook, what are you baking in, in terms of potential synergies from points integration maybe later on in the year into your e-commerce packages and then another question just guidance related as well, how should we think about the drag from the social and outbound for this year? Is it material if it is and can you just call it out, thanks.\nAman Bhutani: When you think about point synergies, we gave you guys some guidance around the top line and the bottom line. There is going to be investment year for Poynt. As we integrated into our offering we'll be spending money on marketing, spending money on product as well as experimenting across the front side of that. So that will be dilutive to the tune of $20 million in '21. On Social, think about that being ahead went through the first half and less so in the back, post our decision to pick up the outbound calling motion. So first quarter will be the highest headwind and then it starts to diminish as we move through the back half.\nNaved Khan: And then maybe just a quick clarification on the synergy comment Ray, so the curve you kind of gave us at the time of acquisition I think it's around $150 million in bookings by 2023. Should we expect any kind of revenue synergies to emerge this year at all or not?\nRay Winborne: Yeah, you'll see some. This year is going to be a lot more focused on getting to market right. Payments will be first, but it's certainly not going to be linear. Next year 2022 will be more of the go to market strategy starting to drive revenue and then our expectation is we'll start to scale in three and that number that we put out sort of 150 in '23 should be a conservative number based off of what we're looking at.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Piper Sandler. Cart [ph] please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Cart on for Brent. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to domain growth 14% another quarter of acceleration. I just wanted to dig in there, what is driving that growth? Is that all primary markets and if so, I see the dott.com and dot.net registration came down in Q4 but still at elevated levels. I guess what has given you the confidence from that guidance as double-digit growth for domain in 2021 and will there be any contribution from the new products for corporate domains or anything like that, that will be an offset.\nRay Winborne: Yeah we're really pleased with the pleased with the performance in domains closing out 2020 with really solid growth and then obviously you saw the guide into 2021 continuing to see good strength and it is broad-based. That's the beauty of that business. Aman mentioned earlier, we own the dream phase of the customer journey. So it's strength across primary registrations. Renewals have been strong. We got aftermarket that is really doing well as we continue to improve the customer experience, but also the merchandising on front of site and in last, there is a modest contribution registry that I mentioned earlier roughly half a point on total revenue in 2021.\nUnidentified Analyst: And now that point is closed, I was wondering if you could frame the journey that for that company to come to payment facility you're in? How much of the offering the payment solution versus a third party profits and will you aggressive move to the internal solution for digital only commerce?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah when we look at Poynt, obviously Poynt today has go to market strategy that's through a distribution channel, but when you see Poynt and Go Daddy together, obviously with Go Daddy's brand and 21 million customers and lots of folks being attracted to us with websites plus marketing, manage WordPress, which includes commerce on both sides, what we're excited about is bringing those pieces together and using the capabilities Go Daddy has and we have multiple capabilities to that. We have the opportunity to go direct to customer right because people know Go Daddy, they come into the sales path, they notice that the capabilities of there and it's seamless, it's integrated that works super well. We also work like I said with 1.5 million designers and developers right as we make the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystems easier for them to you and we integrate these capabilities of payments and others into that experience, we think there's a great channel there for us to work with customers that we already have that work with other folks and give them the right incentives to sort of continue to fuel that pipeline. And then we always have Care right. We continue to have folks that call us, message us and although again we believe less in the outbound motion. So we're not talking about doing that but we do have a huge amount of inbound coming to us and that will continue to be a avenue for growth for us as well. So the incremental effort, the investment that we're putting in here, we think it's fantastic right and in terms of I think your question about using our internal systems, Poynt is already a payment facilitator. So we will be doing this ourselves right. It will not be -- that part will not be with a third-party.\nChristie Masoner:  [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian. Ygal, please go ahead again.\nYgal Arounian: Hey thanks for taking one more. I wanted to come back to commerce and just ask with the Poynt acquisition maybe with some of what you're doing around Pro Hub and the greater focus just around commerce over the past yearend and into next year, you guys have always talked about your core customer as being the micro business. Does this change that at all or is it still kind of the same type of business, but those that are more focused on commerce and where you see what's becoming mid-level crowded but at least a more crowded commerce software arena? Where do you guys see yourselves competing the most?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah Ygal, we are still laser focused on our customer segment. These are the micro businesses or the small of the small businesses folks that have 20 employees or less, 10 employees or less and in 2020 they have had to pivot online very, very quickly. I need to explain that I think you guys know that very, very well, but let me tell you just a small story. We did a -- we have a customer in the UK, they make vegan pies and the place is called Magpie and they just have a fantastic product and we got to know them, we love the folks that run Magpie and our marketing team decided to have to showcase them in one of our marketing campaign just to check out the ad, it's phenomenal. Well, here was what I imagine was a local place where people in the same neighborhood probably came to them and bought pies from them. Well, the day they went live in our advertising now they're shipping pies all over the UK right. By definition they are now a company that is online and we think that opportunity exists for every micro business, right. The Internet is the great equalizer. It allows customers to reach these micro businesses and with the toolset with the guidance we offer in Care, these micro businesses can absolutely provide the experience to their customers that is professional, that does the job in a manner that leaves their customer's impressed. So to your question, we focus on our customer segment, absolutely we're building all our products roundup for those customers and all those customers are going online. In our research, they clearly show that they want commerce and they want it online because anyone of them can be like Magpie.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of James [ph]. James please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is actually Trevor on from the Barclays team. You're hosting in presence guidance for the full-year is high single digit while 1Q is mid-single-digit implying acceleration throughout the year. Is that just a matter of the tougher comp in 1Q or the updating impact from social and outbound as the year progresses, thanks?\nRay Winborne: You answered your own question there exactly that, it's last year pre COVID, Social was growing and then second quarter, we started seeing the impact and then obviously beginning in the early July, we took out the outbound calling. So that's the progression you'll see as you move through 2021, but the implication in that guide was that we will see high single digits in that line.\nUnidentified Analyst: So could you exit the year at double-digit rates?\nRay Winborne: Yes.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich from Deutsche Bank. Chris, please go ahead.\nChris Kuntarich: Just going back to the question before last, you talked about really how you guy's core focus is still on the businesses with 10 to 20 employees the micro-SMB segment. How do you think about driving more value in the product to the lower end specifically on the e-commerce product side versus driving value at the higher end just through the lens of websites plus marketing subscriptions? How do you think about driving pricing leverage and value to those customers differently that is, thanks?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah Chris, these customers, we can definitely differentiate certain items and say look here are certain features that are better for these customers create more value and we have tears that different customers can talk, but I'd like to just bring it back to the idea that most of these customers are going online and doing commerce online in a significant way for the first time. Even the base set of features they need those to be super simple and what they really need is when they're confused to call someone and to get it to work just the way they want it. We've given the example in the past and I'll share a little bit of an update on it. We talked about how for the super small customers, the templates that create a one page commerce site when we created the first one, it just took off. It became the biggest thing right. We've now added more template and we find all of our customers going towards those templates because even I hate to call them bigger customers, but even customers that have 20 employees are learning their way through e-commerce and immediately they want to set the things where they're having trouble managing their inventory and they're calling us. They're having trouble taking what they're doing in the store to online and they need help and we're there or they want to manage between their online in-store and what they're selling on the major platforms and if that feedback that we're talking, we think okay, clearly these customers need the same thing which is they want from one place to be able to sell in their store, sell on their website and sell on any platform and hence you saw the Poynt acquisition us bringing together websites plus marketing, celebrate that we already own and the Poynt capabilities because we know that it works across the spectrum of customers we have and it's not really about truly separating out the value of sort of the top end of that or the bottom end of that.\nChristie Masoner: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. I'll turn the call over to Aman for some closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. I'll just end with a thank you to all Go Daddy employees all around the world. 2020 brought many challenges for many of us at a personal level and I feel like every person leaned in to produce these fantastic results. Thank you all again for joining us and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nChristie Masoner: Good bye.",

            "name": "Ray Winborne",
            "content": "Thanks Aman. I'll touch on the fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for 2021. Despite the operational challenges caused by the pandemic, we delivered a strong performance in 2020. We added 1.4 million net new customers, nearly double the number added in 2019. This was complemented by a decrease in our already low customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewal rates as our products and services became even more valuable to our customers. Full year revenue grew 11% year-over-year while our free cash flow was up 12%, even as we invested more marketing to capture higher demand in the market. We also took advantage of the opportunities created by the uncertainty deploying $1.8 billion capital adding capabilities for customers and creating value for shareholders. Turning to the fourth quarter results, we saw continued acceleration in topline. Bookings grew $943 million rising 13% year-over-year reported in constant currency basis as FX had little impact on the quarter. Growth was broad-based with continued strength across product categories. Revenue came in at $874 million outperforming expectations and growing 12% year-over-year. Business applications was again our fastest growing product line, increasing 20% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. Domains accelerated to 14% growth as new registrations, renewals and aftermarket sales remained strong along with a modest contribution from Go Daddy registry and finally, hosting new presence grew over 5% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see terrific growth in our website creation platform products. Through the strength was tempered somewhat of the headwinds from the Go Daddy social service due to elimination of the outbound sales motion in June. The key metrics underlying our growth remain consistently strong, ARPU rose to $166 up 5% year-over-year while the customer base grew 7%. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $181 million and $825 million for the full-year. This reflected good operating leverage in the P&L as well as reduced capital expenditures for corporate real estate and infrastructure as we transition more workloads to the cloud. Gross margin remained in the mid-60s in the quarter consistent with our expectations. We continue to ramp investment in marketing to capture increasing demand, resulting in a $40 million year-over-year increase in marketing expense. As we mentioned last quarter, we've been to elevate investment while remaining within our targeted return metrics, even as we saw increased competition and performance advertising channels. On the balance sheet, we finished the year with $765 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. Net debt landed at $2.4 billion putting net leverage at 2.6 times on a trailing 12 month basis, illustrating our ability to deleverage quickly. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet, enabling us to execute across our capital allocation priorities. During 2020, we completed four acquisitions, repurchase nearly 6% of our outstanding equity and average prices substantially today stock price and settled the TRA at an attractive valuation, removing an overhang to stop. All proof points that we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunity as it arises. Rest assured, we'll continue to be proven allocators of capital in the pursuit of long-term growth and levered free cash flow per share. As we look to the future, continued growth and cash flow a strong balance sheet will provide us with the flexibility to deploy roughly $5 billion in capital through 2023. Moving on to our outlook for 2021, we expect to deliver revenue of approximately $3.7 billion representing growth of 12% versus 2020. From a product category perspective, we expect double-digit growth in domains, high single-digit growth in hosting new presence and high teens growth in business applications. This guidance includes $20 million in revenue we expect from the recent acquisition of Poynt. As for Q1, we started the year off on pace and expect to deliver revenue of $885 million represented a 12% growth versus last year. We expect 2021 unlevered free cash flow of approximately $945 million or 15% growth versus 2020. This guidance reflects continued investment in marketing and product plus $20 million in net delusion from Poynt as we build out our capabilities in commerce this year. Finally, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points for the full-year 2021. We expect bookings to grow at a rate similar to revenue and normalized EBITDA margin to be roughly flat as compared to 2020. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, income tax benefits of $25 million and cash interest payments of $100 million based on current debt outstanding in today's forward rate expectations. We announced my retirement today and I want to thank all of you who have been along for the ride. I've had an incredibly rewarding career and to have blessed to have been able to top it off at Go Daddy. It's been my privilege to serve with this amazing group of people dedicated to such a noble mission. We navigated a lot of change as Go Daddy has evolved into a truly customer-centric company, obsessed with creating value for customers, employees and shareholders. This last year was challenging for a lot of people, but also very rewarding as I've been able to witness our leadership team taking bold, decisiveness and strategically sound actions that help our customers employees through an incredibly turbulent year. As to what's next, I plan to be deeply engaged in the search for a successor and I'll stay on to ensure a smooth transition. I look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from IR team open up the call for questions. Ron it's Ray. Appreciate the kind words first, but our normalized EBITDA margin were holding that flat year-over-year, which we're pretty pleased with given the investment we're going to put in place. Both in products, Poynt will be a big piece of that. I mentioned in the call comments that we've got net delusional about $20 million around commerce and we'll continue to invest more in marketing this year as well. So those are the two big drivers our normalized EBITDA margin. Yeah, Aman hit it on the head. This was more about the strategy and verticalization on domains. This is a future benefit to us as we get more control over the domain costs, which is one of our largest cost in the P&L. You think about contribution to the topline Ygal, the purchase accounting impacts from Neustar absolutely muted the impacts on the top line. If you're looking year-over-year, '21 contribution inorganic contributions for Neustar are going to be roughly half a point on the topline. Yeah Jason when you think about leverage, right, we've had a targeted two to four tons leverage since we've been public and we've been at the very top of that range when the opportunity presented itself and we've been more about balancing our capital allocation priorities. You saw every flavor of it in 2020. We leaned in the marketing, put a lot of money into organic growth because the opportunity presented itself. We closed on four acquisitions last year. We bought back stock and we also settled the TRA's. So we're really using that cash flow that incredibly strong and consistent cash flow that you talked about to drive significant returns for the company. And we do see the opportunity to Aman's point, we're certainly not hesitant to take our leverage to four times. Hey Drew, it's Ray, when you look at the inorganic contribution on an incremental basis in '21, it's about a Poynt right. $20 million or so that's coming from Poynt, I just mentioned on I think it was a Ygal's question earlier that Neustar is about another half a point there. So those are the two big biggies that are contributing and it's around that one point contribution. Yeah I think as you look at what we've been spending on marketing, it's roughly 13% of revenue in 2020, but it's discipline right. We're disciplined in approach, we're disciplined in the execution of delivering the P&L and the P&L we've got a really good track record of investing in marketing over time with good returns and the strong unit economics that we've got. And we've trend with the team to stretch and look at the next marginal customer at an acceptable return that is all about balance. But when we do see that, we extend to pay that period and that does create more risk or higher risk profile for us because it does hit the bottom line in the short term but for the right paybacks we are willing to do that. You might notice in those slides that we put out with the earnings, we've put a new slide in for marketing with a different lens on how we see the returns. So we'll take a look at that but in summary, we did roughly $0.85 in incremental bookings and $0.45 in incremental gross profit in 2020 for every dollar that we spent on marketing and advertising. So when you compare that against other in the industry, that's going to shape up pretty well. Both are doing strongly. Obviously we've put a lot more shouldering the websites and marketing recently. You heard Aman's comments earlier. One of the things we would point that is going to help us there is continue to push on commerce which will stretch into the manage WordPress and ecommerce offering as well. Yeah, you'll see some. This year is going to be a lot more focused on getting to market right. Payments will be first, but it's certainly not going to be linear. Next year 2022 will be more of the go to market strategy starting to drive revenue and then our expectation is we'll start to scale in three and that number that we put out sort of 150 in '23 should be a conservative number based off of what we're looking at. Yeah we're really pleased with the pleased with the performance in domains closing out 2020 with really solid growth and then obviously you saw the guide into 2021 continuing to see good strength and it is broad-based. That's the beauty of that business. Aman mentioned earlier, we own the dream phase of the customer journey. So it's strength across primary registrations. Renewals have been strong. We got aftermarket that is really doing well as we continue to improve the customer experience, but also the merchandising on front of site and in last, there is a modest contribution registry that I mentioned earlier roughly half a point on total revenue in 2021. You answered your own question there exactly that, it's last year pre COVID, Social was growing and then second quarter, we started seeing the impact and then obviously beginning in the early July, we took out the outbound calling. So that's the progression you'll see as you move through 2021, but the implication in that guide was that we will see high single digits in that line. Yes."

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thanks Mark and thank you all for joining us. Go Daddy exists to empower everyday entrepreneurs. Our mission is to make opportunity inclusive for all and the shift to digital represents the greatest opportunity for our customers to share their gifts with the world. With a differentiated offering, including guidance and tools within intuitive seamless experience, specifically designed and built for our customers, it is clear like customers continue to adopt our products and ask us for more. Everyday entrepreneurs are creative and resourceful and they want to be able to focus their time on their business from domain names email and content creation to commerce and soon they include payments and point-of-sale. Customer focus for us is about building a seamlessly intuitive experience that saves them time and unlocks capabilities through ease of use. In 2020, our digital presence was key for our customers and the increased demand led to accelerating bookings growth for the last three quarters for us. For 2020, GoDaddy neared $3.8 billion in booking and topped $3.3 billion in revenue. We leaned into the surge in demand with marketing spend and while we kept it efficient, the result was our best year of net customer ads except 2017, which included the HG [ph] acquisition. We welcomed nearly 1.4 million net new customers in 2020 by providing valuable products and offering the best care. We've also been able to maintain stable renewal rates and our churn metrics, well those have always been low and they still found room to improve in 2020. Early last year we spoke about our natural evolution into commerce. Everyday entrepreneurs are underserved and demanded from us and our investments have been focused on the simplest and most relevant commerce experience. No doubt commerce continue to be a giant opportunity for us. Internally, we are also evolving. We have made significant progress in implementing a broader experimentation program that allows us to more clearly measure the value we are creating for customers and deliver functionality faster. The discipline of measurement allows us to set more ambitious goals while also giving us the confidence to achieve them. We are moving faster, putting more products in the hands of more customers and winning the right to do more for them. Our leadership team is also evolving. 2020 was a year of milestone and clearly defining achievements for many GoDaddy leaders. After having truly accomplished herculean tasks both in 2020 and over their respective careers, our Chief Legal Officer, Nima Kelly and our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Winborne have each expressed a desire to retire at some point this year. They continue to be fully engaged with the company and will help with transition as we look to fill that incredibly big shoes. We have a strong leadership team with talented, tenured folks and with continued leadership from [indiscernible], we expect a seamless transition. We have strong internal candidates and we will be looking for external candidates for both roles as well. With acceleration in the number and also in our internal operating rhythm, I want to share three priority areas where GoDaddy will be bringing innovative solutions to our customers in 2021. Our top priority is commerce and 2021 is the year we will bring to market a holistic solution for everyday entrepreneurs that powers every facet of their online and offline commerce experience. In 2020, we created strong customer value with our commerce tools and GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite grew 75% year-over-year. In 2021, GoDaddy will extend our current operating with a focus on delivering Omni-commerce solutions. Earlier this week, we closed on the Poynt acquisition and as you know Poynt extend our commerce offering with a set of products that span the full spectrum of commerce enablement. Poynt brings us payment capabilities as a payment facilitator and bring immense value to our customers through its innovative point of sale terminal, inventory management software, loyalty management tool and more. Poynt and Go Daddy customers are already seeing great success, represented by the combined $23 billion in annualized GMV that already flows through our platforms as we integrate and build the Go Daddy commerce platform it's scale will be backed by the 6,000 guides that are ready to provide guidance we know our customers need. To help drive focus and continued momentum in commerce, we have created a new commerce division within Go Daddy. Poynt CEO, Osama Bedier has joined Go Daddy and will leave this new division reporting to me. The next priority I want to share is about our pro customer. We already have a large group of designers and developers that are Go Daddy customers, but we know the opportunity is much, much larger. Last year our partners whose sole focus is to create value for designers and developers went back to first principle. Deep research into the customer needs led to a new set of solutions organized in three pillars. The first pillar is all about a seamless intuitive experience in the tools that we offer. In January we launched the hub for Go Daddy pros where website designers and developers can perform their work in a simple intuitive way that saves them time and money. The hub enables bulk updates across hundreds of sites for WordPress, plug-ins and Themes allowing pros to roll out updates for better security, new functionality and better availability. What may have taken hours now takes seconds and even works on WordPress sites now hosted by Go Daddy. Pros can also use the hubs built in project management tools and make it easier than ever to deliver customized sites for their clients. The hub let's pros manage all of their [indiscernible] in one place and built-in delegated access allows pros to collaborate with their clients more effectively to drive the results their customers want to see. The second pillar is all about care. Pros have told us that they value the kind of guidance and care we offer and they want us to do more. We have extended our care to support pros for all their WordPress sites, not just the ones that host with us. With additional care guides armed with a high level of training to support these pros, we are ready for the unique needs of this customer population. The third pillar to bring that altogether through marketing, with millions of pros out there, we have planned a marketing launch to tell them about the added value and capabilities we are bringing forward. It all begins with the laws of the Go Daddy Pro program. Signing up to be a Go Daddy Pro gets pros access to exclusive discounts for themselves and for their clients and direct access to the most advanced guide directly through the hub speaking their language exactly the way they wanted. Go Daddy Pro is live in the US with its first marketing campaign and in April, we will be hosting our first virtual Go Daddy Pro conference and we're just getting started. Lookout for more benefits of being a Go Daddy Pro and its global launch. The three pillars together embrace the needs of our Pro customers and enhance our relationship with them beyond a strong managed WordPress offering. Overall, our strategy is straight forward. WordPress is the largest CMS in the world with a market share of over 60% and growing. Pros know WordPress and prefer WordPress and our vision is all about making a seamless and intuitive while retaining all its power and flexibility. We are not interested in forcing pros to use a different tool. That sounds like a job participant. While it is exciting to talk about new offerings like commerce and Go Daddy Pro, under these exciting new businesses, is the solid foundation of our domains business and that is the third priority I want to talk to you about. Clear as we have outgrown the domains industry with innovative ideas and execution in both the primary and secondary market. That growth isn't going away anytime soon. Recently, we added Go Daddy corporate domain and Go Daddy registry, which promise to offer new and existing customers with innovative solutions, but that isn't all. Our client team has really stepped up their experimentation velocity. These are the folks that run the search algorithm on Go Daddy.com. We are building an adaptive user experience, which leverages multiple inputs including the customer's profile, liquidity, it's context, the available results and also available add-on to make sure customers see the options and bundle that will create the most value. Our aftermarket has also seeing tailwinds from the digital transformation of small business. More businesses coming online is resulting in more customers leveraging our domain broker service to help them secure the perfect name for their online presence, even if someone else already owns it. Our new list for sales rule has also seen an incredible first inning. This tool let's customers with unused domain names, list them in our aftermarket and in just three months, we've seen over 350,000 domains get listed. The outcome here is a continued acceleration in this business as more customers are matched with better offerings and are exposed to attach opportunity as well. Most of the financial impact of this accelerating innovation and domains is still to come and we are confident that the outperformance we have seen in this category will continue well beyond 2021. At our scale, innovation like this, not only drives growth, but also helps one exciting new initiatives across the business. I look forward to sharing more on the three priorities I just went through as the year progresses. Before I wrap up, I know that many of you are eager to hear about the results of our websites plus marketing freemium offering. In less than a year, it has shown itself to be an area of real promise for Go Daddy. Beginning in the spring of 2020, we conducted a small-scale experiment presenting our freemium offering to a limited number of visitors. Over the course of the year, we steadily increased the number of US base visitors that would see this offering to approximately 50% and we are pleased with the results we've seen along the way. Millions of sign-ups and solid conversion rates that we're happy to note are higher than what we had seen elsewhere in the industry. There is certainly more to be done and this is an exciting outcome as we work to make freemium a tailwind to our business for years to come. Looking at 2021, while there are many unknowns and many things we plan to accomplish, we continue to see evidence in our business that supports aggressive forward momentum. As Ray will share through focused execution, Go Daddy delivered a strong result in 2020 in the face of many challenges. Our core strategy of creating value for customers and converting it to shareholder value over time is working. We are evolving as a company and are in a fantastic spot as we enter into 2021. With that, here is Ray. Ron, thanks for the question and yes, commerce continues to be our number one priority and you're right, you laid it out really well with websites plus marketing in place, Sellbrite also growing quickly, which you didn't mention, also huge opportunity for us in the WooCommerce space, we haven't talked about that much but you know about the SkyVerge acquisition that is helping us bring a program that we call a new Woo, that we'll talk about in the future as well. So yes,, all those things coming together Poynt adding those core capabilities as a payments facilitator invoicing point of sale and the idea is to bring all those pieces together and continue the pace of acceleration. If you just look at GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite, the annualized number we gave you last quarter was much lower than the one you're seeing today and that itself represents quarter-over-quarter acceleration. Happy to take that, on pros, let's start with the numbers because I think that was in the middle of your question. We have about 1.5 million pros as part of our 21 million customers. So we already have a lot of pros that engage with us on a daily basis. We know that the opportunity is much, much larger and what the pro hub is about is it was about going to the pro scene, what do you guys need in terms of the interface and then building that in a manner that works best for them. And the go to market strategy around it, the Go Daddy program that at all about pro signing up and getting benefits, benefits that over time grow and there is a marketing campaign now in place in the US that is getting word out to say, hey, here is all the new things, the new experience where you can do a whole lot, you got project management tools, you got care with a click through messaging that our guides in the background, there are more guides in number. They have higher level of training and they can execute on more acts from the pros than ever before because we've opened up the aperture of what they can do. So it's the combination of both -- of all of those things that we're really excited about and then in terms of sales and marketing, no doubt care will continue to play a role there, but this is not an outbound motion and what we're really seeing is that pros want to engage with us on the web, they want to engage with care through messaging, they want to move things quickly, They don't even want to wait two minutes for a base load. They don't want to spend hours updating their sites. They want it done in one click and those are the type of capabilities we're opening up here. And then on domains, Ray will take the sort of contribution for Neustar, but just to remind you and it's still super early for us with Neustar, the innovation that we plan to bring to the table is all about having the full stack, being able to innovate on the registry side and the registrar side and bring new offerings and talked about that a little bit in the past. So I'll turn it to Ray to just talk about synergies and contribution as you asked. Thanks Jason. Maybe I'll start and Ray can comment at the end of that. One, I love the idea that you agree that the point is strategically important acquisition and it wasn't very expensive. Those are great acquisitions, I love them but to answer your question, we are looking at the who spectrum Jason. We absolutely agree that many of the core part of our strategy it's in my DNA, it's in the company's DNA. We're good at it. We've done it before but as we're out there looking at the assets as you know it's a competitive or sort of difficult time in the marketplace and we're trying to make sure that the assets we look at truly form part of the advantage we want to create because at the end of the day, what we're looking to have is that simple, intuitive experience. So there is million things I talk about Ray. I'm talking about ease-of-use. I'm talking about saving people time. I'm talking about product interfaces of that truly are magical that lead to high NPS and all the acquisitions we're doing or looking at big or small have to fit into that full. So I wouldn't have anyone think that we're not interested in large acquisitions. We absolutely are, but just we've got a formula we're working it and should be opportunity to you'll find us at the table and Ray, I'll turn it to you for levering up and such. Nick, the question wasn't totally clear, but I think I caught most of it. On freemium, what we're seeing is that customers do come in and the metrics we're looking at includes seven-day conversion and 90-day conversion right. There isn't naturally fixed number of where everyone makes a decision. You continues to see a sort of the tale of people converting over time. Both the seven-day and 90-day, especially as we got into later in the year on the 90-day conversion, we started to have a few cohorts that were reasonable site and we continue to sort of see stable conversion in that 90-days rheum which is what we talked about. In terms of I didn't fully catch this part of your question, but I think the objective of freemium for us is to open up the aperture to allow our customers without friction to try our products but we fundamentally believe that whether you look at websites plus marketing or Sellbrite, which we also turned freemium last year, the value that customers get compared to the price that we charge, really there is a tremendous amount of value and we want to remove any hesitation customers have of trying to use those products. These products are built from the ground up to the exact needs of our customers and we if feel we open up the aperture and get more customers to try that over time it's just going to build a greater and greater battery that leaves to better financial outcomes over time. Our priorities on M&A are aligned with our broader priorities as a company and those priorities simply we are the leader in Dream and we absolutely have some intention there. We're making great progress in creating, that's fantastic, but we're putting disproportion about the time and energy resources integral and that's how our M&A team is prioritizing as well because actually create and grow off are more and more working together and that's a massive opportunity and when we talk about our $180 billion TAM, a huge percentage of that is within the growth phase. So that's where the majority of our energy is. Hey Aaron, I'll take both of those and Mark you can chip something. When you look at Q4 customer growth, still seeing record type levels. The momentum has been good and momentum has carried on into January. So nothing different in the trajectory that we've been seen at point. With cloud you saw some of the impact of cloud in 2020, showing or manifesting itself in lower capital expenditures because we have continued to move workloads into the cloud, that is pressure on the second outline, that's one of the investments we're making there, but if you recall back when we signed our contract with AWS, we were going to manage this thing to a cash basis and that's what we are continuing to do and that's one of the reasons we use unlevered free cash flow as our key metric there because the balance from normalized EBITDA down there, obviously includes the CapEx versus the OpEx up in the P&L. Thanks, let me take freemium and a little bit on the marketing spend and perhaps Ray wants to comment on that as well. On freemium, I actually go back to the comments Mark that in the prepared comments, what we're seeing in terms of conversion is a rate that's higher than what we've seen in the industry. So of course it's still early in the journey for us, but that's really good, that's really comforting, it's what's the concerns that people may have had. But when I look at being able to improve conversion over time, absolutely we have people dedicated to doing that, but for me, the biggest things is I want to get it out broader and broader and broader right. I'd like to have it at a 100% in the US soon. I'd like to go global with it and that's what I'm really pushing the team because we know that at the end of the day, it's about attracting more people to our products and getting them to use our products because once they use our products, people see that we have something differentiated offer that it works in a manner that they didn't fully understand that Go Daddy would have that offering. And then in terms of marketing, Ray can talk a little bit about the numbers and the unit economics and how we've continued to sort of maintain our benchmarks and wants to break even, but I'd like to give you a little context of how I think about and the marketing spend and the approach there is one of there you want to spend up in marketing and have you spend up you have to continually improve your measurement, your ability to get into more and more channels and as you do that and you improve your internal capabilities to market better, you can then spend even more in marketing and I've talked about sort of this idea of improvement in growth and improvement in spend in the path and it's something that I have experienced with and I am pretty pleased with what I'm seeing in terms of Go Daddy in 2020 and what we have forecasted for 2021. I'll give you a kind of a view into those website creation of products last quarter with an ARR of $350 million growing in the high 30s. We've continued to see strong growth in both of those metrics. When you think about point synergies, we gave you guys some guidance around the top line and the bottom line. There is going to be investment year for Poynt. As we integrated into our offering we'll be spending money on marketing, spending money on product as well as experimenting across the front side of that. So that will be dilutive to the tune of $20 million in '21. On Social, think about that being ahead went through the first half and less so in the back, post our decision to pick up the outbound calling motion. So first quarter will be the highest headwind and then it starts to diminish as we move through the back half. Yeah when we look at Poynt, obviously Poynt today has go to market strategy that's through a distribution channel, but when you see Poynt and Go Daddy together, obviously with Go Daddy's brand and 21 million customers and lots of folks being attracted to us with websites plus marketing, manage WordPress, which includes commerce on both sides, what we're excited about is bringing those pieces together and using the capabilities Go Daddy has and we have multiple capabilities to that. We have the opportunity to go direct to customer right because people know Go Daddy, they come into the sales path, they notice that the capabilities of there and it's seamless, it's integrated that works super well. We also work like I said with 1.5 million designers and developers right as we make the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystems easier for them to you and we integrate these capabilities of payments and others into that experience, we think there's a great channel there for us to work with customers that we already have that work with other folks and give them the right incentives to sort of continue to fuel that pipeline. And then we always have Care right. We continue to have folks that call us, message us and although again we believe less in the outbound motion. So we're not talking about doing that but we do have a huge amount of inbound coming to us and that will continue to be a avenue for growth for us as well. So the incremental effort, the investment that we're putting in here, we think it's fantastic right and in terms of I think your question about using our internal systems, Poynt is already a payment facilitator. So we will be doing this ourselves right. It will not be -- that part will not be with a third-party. Yeah Ygal, we are still laser focused on our customer segment. These are the micro businesses or the small of the small businesses folks that have 20 employees or less, 10 employees or less and in 2020 they have had to pivot online very, very quickly. I need to explain that I think you guys know that very, very well, but let me tell you just a small story. We did a -- we have a customer in the UK, they make vegan pies and the place is called Magpie and they just have a fantastic product and we got to know them, we love the folks that run Magpie and our marketing team decided to have to showcase them in one of our marketing campaign just to check out the ad, it's phenomenal. Well, here was what I imagine was a local place where people in the same neighborhood probably came to them and bought pies from them. Well, the day they went live in our advertising now they're shipping pies all over the UK right. By definition they are now a company that is online and we think that opportunity exists for every micro business, right. The Internet is the great equalizer. It allows customers to reach these micro businesses and with the toolset with the guidance we offer in Care, these micro businesses can absolutely provide the experience to their customers that is professional, that does the job in a manner that leaves their customer's impressed. So to your question, we focus on our customer segment, absolutely we're building all our products roundup for those customers and all those customers are going online. In our research, they clearly show that they want commerce and they want it online because anyone of them can be like Magpie. Yeah Chris, these customers, we can definitely differentiate certain items and say look here are certain features that are better for these customers create more value and we have tears that different customers can talk, but I'd like to just bring it back to the idea that most of these customers are going online and doing commerce online in a significant way for the first time. Even the base set of features they need those to be super simple and what they really need is when they're confused to call someone and to get it to work just the way they want it. We've given the example in the past and I'll share a little bit of an update on it. We talked about how for the super small customers, the templates that create a one page commerce site when we created the first one, it just took off. It became the biggest thing right. We've now added more template and we find all of our customers going towards those templates because even I hate to call them bigger customers, but even customers that have 20 employees are learning their way through e-commerce and immediately they want to set the things where they're having trouble managing their inventory and they're calling us. They're having trouble taking what they're doing in the store to online and they need help and we're there or they want to manage between their online in-store and what they're selling on the major platforms and if that feedback that we're talking, we think okay, clearly these customers need the same thing which is they want from one place to be able to sell in their store, sell on their website and sell on any platform and hence you saw the Poynt acquisition us bringing together websites plus marketing, celebrate that we already own and the Poynt capabilities because we know that it works across the spectrum of customers we have and it's not really about truly separating out the value of sort of the top end of that or the bottom end of that. Thank you, Christie. I'll just end with a thank you to all Go Daddy employees all around the world. 2020 brought many challenges for many of us at a personal level and I feel like every person leaned in to produce these fantastic results. Thank you all again for joining us and I look forward to talking to you next quarter."

With me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, net debt, gross and merchandize volume and annualized recurring revenue.

With that, here\u2019s Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark and thank you all for joining us. Today, I\u2019m excited to share the details on a record quarter for GoDaddy. Before we get started, though, I want to announce a change to our leadership team. Andrew Low Ah Kee, our Chief Operating Officer is leaving GoDaddy effective November 13, after nearly a decade with the company. As a colleague and friend, I\u2019m grateful for his significant contributions over the years. He was a key part of building the great company we have today, and I wish him all the best in his new adventure, which will be announced over the next few days. We stand today with a deep leadership bench, including both tenured and new leaders organized to deliver on the needs of our customers and our strategic priorities. With this full complement of leaders in place, we will make a few adjustments, but we will not backfill the COO role. This will allow for a seamless transition so we can stay focused on executing against our strategy, and every day our passion for that strategy grows as more entrepreneurs trust and partner with GoDaddy to start with a dream and then create and grow that dream. We are pleased with our progress, and today I would like to highlight three key areas. First, our strong execution against our strategy with a few notable milestones. Second, our continued progress in online presence solutions, including leaning into commerce capabilities. And third, our continued investment in marketing to capture demand. Q3 was another record quarter of customer growth, and we are seeing sustained momentum into October. In Q3, we once again, added over 400,000 net new customers while also seeing improved customer retention. We continue to see increased demand for online solutions due to the pandemic and coupled with higher marketing spend our website traffic has increased by an average of 20% year-over-year since April. We have seen increased adoption of our website creation platform, websites plus marketing and managed WordPress as well as our content and commerce tools, Over and Sellbrite. As an additional insight into this part of the business, we are excited to share that together this solution reached an annualized recurring revenue of nearly $350 million in Q3 growing at approximately 40% year-over-year. This group of products now account for more than 2.2 million subscriptions growing over 20% year over year. Additionally, this quarter we saw an acceleration of Sellbrite\u2019s GMV growth between websites plus marketing and Sellbrite GoDaddy now has more than $4.5 billion of annualized GMV transacting through our platforms, growing at nearly 80% year-over-year. These proof points reinforce our strategy of driving scale in the growth phase for customers by focusing on commerce. Business applications as a product line continued to accelerate in the third quarter, surpassing the milestone of 3 million customers with nearly 9 million seats of email. Best of all, these numbers continue to grow at a healthy pace. While we\u2019re pleased with the growth in these key areas, we\u2019re not resting on our laurels. We\u2019re driving product enhancements and increasing our marketing efforts to facilitate profitable long-term growth. We continue to charge towards the massive opportunities of content creation and commerce. This quarter, we accomplished this through deep partnership integrations, internally developed software releases, and an important commerce acquisition. In partnerships, we recently announced a deeper integration with Facebook\u2019s business extension, GoDaddy websites plus marketing customers can now create shoppable posts as well as set up shops on both Instagram and Facebook with automatic syncing between both platforms offering yet another channel for our customers to easily sell their products. Additionally, our new partnership with Vimeo allows customers to upload, preview, and insert videos, including using a video as a header to their website. We\u2019ve also continued to accelerate our velocity internally, delivering a busy product launch schedule in the quarter. We released a full integration of our Over app within websites plus marketing a short few months into the acquisition, making it even easier for customers to market their businesses with creative content. This seamlessly intuitive experience has driven over 50% growth in posts. We\u2019ve also extended the Over app across 12 new languages giving more customers access to this powerful set of tools. Additionally, GoDaddy released a powerful social composer dashboard in websites plus marketing, giving customers a single place to rapidly create polished social content and view and schedule their social posts across connected social media platforms. What\u2019s more, users can track the performance metrics of each post by platform. We also introduced a simple and intuitive one page e-commerce template in websites plus marketing, which has quickly become our most popular template and it has reduced time to publish for our customers by 40%. Continuing on the theme of commerce, we launched our online store capabilities in Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Chile positioning GoDaddy to serve customers in these markets. We also continue to innovate for our domains customers. In Q3, we introduced revamped box search and file upload tools for domain investors and rolled out free global WHOIS masking and new paid security services with greater domain protection. And we\u2019re super excited to welcome the SkyVerge team with nearly 60 WooCommerce extensions spanning payments, email marketing and memberships, SkyVerge is a leading WooCommerce product developer. This acquisition furthers our commitment in WordPress to help entrepreneurs and web professionals succeed online with high performance stores that are feature rich and quick to build. Lastly, in Q2, we talked about our plan to delever marketing for as long as we continue to see returns on our investments. While the investment increased, we also delivered another record quarter for both customer ads and total cohort size. Obviously, it\u2019s something we\u2019re quite pleased to see, particularly as we\u2019ve coupled these strong marketing gains alongside the great product enhancements we\u2019ve talked about today. In closing, our focus is to build simple and easy to use tools with a focus on helping everyday entrepreneurs succeed. Online commerce and marketing are areas where this need has become significantly more pronounced in 2020. We are seeing rapid adoption of these new tools, giving us the opportunity to help more customers succeed, solid execution in an elevated demand environment powered a strong third quarter. We are poised for sustainable, profitable long-term growth, and we continue to be confident in our ability to hit our 4-1-1 target in 2022. With that, here\u2019s Ray.\nRay Winborne: Hey, thanks, Aman. I\u2019ll touch on the financial results for what was a great quarter for GoDaddy and then provide our outlook for Q4. Q3 reflected a strong performance across the board with another record quarter of customer growth, an acceleration in top-line growth and margin expansion, and new customer bookings continue to hit records. while small relative to total bookings, they\u2019re an important contributor to future growth. We\u2019ve also continued to experience low customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewal rates, proof points to the durability of the business model. Total revenue came in at $844 million growing 11% year-over-year while currency impacts were negligible. growth rates accelerated across all three product categories and reaccelerated in our international business. Business applications was our fastest growing product line increasing 19% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. We delivered 12% growth in domains across new registrations, strong renewals and aftermarket sales. And finally, Hosting and Presence grew 6%. inside that, Aman highlighted the tremendous growth in products comprising our website creation platforms. In contrast, it also reflects a headwind from the GoDaddy social product due to the elimination of the outbound sales force in June. Total bookings grew to $945 million rising 11% year-over-year while currency impacts were negligible. strength in bookings was broad-based across products and geographies as our brand and product offerings positioned us well to capture demand as businesses continue their digital transformation. For many small businesses establishing an online presence was once seen as a competitive advantage. It\u2019s now table stakes. gross margin came in at 66% in a quarter, a 40 basis point expansion year-over-year. we also delivered operating leverage as the June restructuring actions reduced costs and care while G&A continued to benefit from both scale and lower discretionary expenses. As we highlighted on the second quarter call, we stepped up our investment in marketing to capture market demand resulting in a $36 million year-over-year increase in marketing expense. We\u2019ve been able to elevate our investment while remaining within our target months to break even and customer acquisition costs even as we saw increased competition and performance advertising channels, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in marketing as long as we\u2019re meeting our return metrics. the net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $199 million in Q3, or approximately two points of margin expansion over last year. Moving to cash flow, unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, growing 17% year-over-year with margin expansion of over a point. trailing 12 month unlevered free cash flow was over $800 million and margin topped 25% illustrating both the size and scale of this business. Now, on to the balance sheet. we finished Q3 with $622 million in cash and total liquidity of over $1.2 billion. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions, issuing a new $750 million, seven-year term loan with an all-in yield of 2.7%. A record for a BB rated company. with this issuance, net debt stands at $2.5 billion or about three times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. That\u2019s the middle of our targeted range of two to four times and we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. If you have our ability to deleverage, this leaves more than ample liquidity to fund the business, execute the strategy and pursue our stated capital allocation priorities. Now, I want to take a moment to reiterate that any potential increases to the corporate tax rate will not have an immediate impact on GoDaddy\u2019s cash flow. As a reminder, given our net operating loss position, we don\u2019t expect to pay U.S. cash taxes before 2027, a higher corporate tax rate would however enhance the value of the recent settlement of the TRA. For example, a 28% rate increases the future tax savings associated with the TRA attributes by over $700 million, further enhancing the already strong returns on the settlement. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet and has enabled us to execute across to our capital allocation priorities in 2020, including completing four acquisitions, repurchasing, nearly 6% of our outstanding equity and settling the TRA. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that arises and will continue to be proven allocators of capital in pursuit of long-term growth and leverage free cash flow per share. With that, let\u2019s turn to our Q4 outlook. We expect total revenue of approximately $865 million, or 11% growth year-over-year. You should expect double-digit growth in domains, mid single-digit growth in Hosting and Presence, and high-teens growth in Business Applications. Remember those products that relied on the outbound calling motion like GoDaddy social disproportionately impact the Hosting and Presence line. on unlevered free cash flow, we expect 2020 to land at approximately $820 million, the midpoint of our previous guidance range. As a reminder, Q4 has a highly anomalous 27th pay period this year, without which our unlevered free cash flow guide would have been approximately $18 million higher. In closing, digital migration is definitely an accelerating trend and it\u2019s here to stay. Our business is well-positioned to meet the needs of entrepreneurs around the globe as they bring their ideas to life online. GoDaddy has long been known as an industry leader with profitable growth at scale, now with a set of subscription software tools, enabling websites, content creation, and commerce, that\u2019s approaching $350 million in annual recurring revenue. We\u2019re as confident as we\u2019ve ever been that we can continue to grow, take, share, and generate significant cash flow. with that, we\u2019ll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Ray. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.\nJason Helfstein: Thank you. So, you noticed 400,000 nets ads in \u2013 over 400,000 net adds in the third quarter. Can you comment how the second quarter compared to this? And then when we think about versus a year ago, can you just comment on customer churn? Are you seeing higher or the same churn? And then secondly, appreciate the $350 million ARR gross bookings. If we \u2013 or the $350 million ARR related to e-commerce, if we divide that into gross bookings, it\u2019s about 9%. Is that a reasonable way to think about kind of sizing the e-commerce business today relative to gross bookings? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Jason. Thanks for that question. This is Aman. When we look at the third quarter, it represents record organic net sub growth for GoDaddy. We\u2019re really happy with the progress here and as we look at Q2, like we said, in some of our prepared remarks, October continued to be in line with September and did really well year-over-year as well. And in terms of churn rates, they continue to be stable slightly better. Just going back to the idea that our customers truly are the everyday entrepreneurs, and if they hit roadblocks, they\u2019re creative, they innovate, and they start something else and get on with it. And then, I\u2019ll turn it to Ray for maybe a little bit more color and to your second question on the $350 million.\nRay Winborne: Hey, Jason. it\u2019s Ray, ARR is not apples-to-apples, obviously, with booking. So, it\u2019s cash versus revenue, but really happy with what we\u2019re seeing there from those products. From a booking\u2019s perspective while we\u2019re growing at relatively similar levels.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citibank. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks. Could you touch on some of the integrations you talked about in the press release and the deck today, what kind of users are you seeing or by subs with these integrations, whether it\u2019s over Instagram, Facebook, and then I guess the follow-up on that is as you integrate all of these great products for subs like Vimeo, SkyVerge, things like that, how does that impact kind of the funnel for subscribers? I guess how do you prevent them from getting confused by, I guess all the options you\u2019re introducing? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. let\u2019s take the specific examples from previous quarters, and then I\u2019ll briefly touch on SkyVerge and how we look at the funnel. Our goal bringing in over, bringing in the experience from Uniregistry was that we wanted to bring to the GoDaddy family companies, teams that were building amazing experiences for customers, sort of best-in-class experiences. And then we want to take those experiences and bring them into our mainstream products like Websites + Marketing. So, when we talk about Over\u2019s integration, it\u2019s all very new right now. So, it\u2019s less about what subscriptions it\u2019s driving, and it\u2019s more about what level of engagement we\u2019re getting from the functionality we\u2019re putting out there. For example, with the Over integration, there was a 50% increase in posts, sort of content creation and people posting that content on social media which shows immediate customer value. And that\u2019s our core formula, right. We want to introduce these pieces whether it is Vimeo or others into the core experience, add the right place. It\u2019s not early in the funnel. It\u2019s as these customers are using these products, it shows up in a simple way at the right place, and it\u2019s just intuitive for the customer to use it. And as we continue to create customer value, over time we can turn it into shareholder value by sort of moving people through the tiers, by taking pricing actions and such, but the first step is really creating customer value. And in terms of SkyVerge, it\u2019s the same formula, SkyVerge team is fantastic in the WooCommerce space, and they have 60 plug-ins. they just are completely focused on building the best experience for customers, and it\u2019s super new right now, but well you can expect the same thing from us that it will become part of our managed WordPress experience, and it will just be simple for customers in terms of their commerce experience with WooCommerce as well. to touch on the funnel just slightly, keep in mind that as we add these capabilities, they are coming in at the right place where the customer is using the product, they \u2013 these things don\u2019t sort of in a sense; clutter the buying experience or the freemium experience in any way. In fact, if anything, as we layer on more and more capability and provide it as part of the freemium package, it \u2013 we feel it encourages people to use the product because they\u2019ve got more functionality that they can use as part of the product.\nNick Jones: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP securities. Ron, please go ahead.\nRon Josey: I think I\u2019m unmuted. Hopefully, you can hear me. great quarter, guys and Aman, thank you for the additional details on the business metrics. I wanted to talk about commerce specifically, the $4.5 billion in GMV and also the integrations with Facebook and Instagram that you just talked about, but can you just talk about what tools you think are still needed to fully take advantage of this commerce opportunity that you\u2019re seeing with the 80% growth in GMV or do you have \u2013 do you think you have a fully integrated approach now to fully take advantage, and then as a follow up to that, can you talk about sort of we\u2019re two quarters into the freemium approach with Websites + Marketing, a quarter in with Sellbrite, just talk out how freemium has maybe changed the complexion of these new subs and these record new subs that are growing to the \u2013 growing on the platform. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Happy to do that, Ron. Thanks for the question. on the first piece about the $350 million and just the color, we\u2019re super-excited about that part of the business and how quickly, it\u2019s growing, I think I\u2019m blanking on the exact word you said, but just on the second part of your question, when I look at the sub\u2019s growth, what I\u2019m really focused on is are we providing the customers the product that they can try out? And as an example, you mentioned, Sellbrite. Sellbrite is doing really, really well, right. The GMV growth that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s fantastic, but it\u2019s because we\u2019re getting the product in the hands of customers and more, and of merchants are quickly using, Sellbrite. by the way, we\u2019re seeing the same in Websites + Marketing. freemium means that more customers are using it. And yes, we\u2019re a couple of quarters in and what that\u2019s done is it\u2019s given us enough confidence that we are rolling the freemium piece out sort of 10% to 20% at a time. It\u2019s not 100% percent in the U.S. yet as we get into every part of our website and our sales path, that\u2019s the place we\u2019re going into.\nRay Winborne: And Ron, it\u2019s Ray. I want to clarify one point on that, within our customer count number, does not include freemium. Those are paid only subscriptions. So that record organic growth is for paid subscriptions, not freemium.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. And I\u2019ll also clarify the numbers that we gave for subscriptions. The $2.2 million doesn\u2019t include subscriptions for over or Sellbrite. Those are core Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. And what we say, what we believe is that over and Sellbrite sort of the customers use that as part of our core platform. And then you asked the question, fixed to hit back to me around gaps, in our offering. the commerce offering is driving a ton of that growth in those suite of products, right. So that\u2019s really fantastic and we serve the needs of a certain set of customers really well already. The way I think about it is that as we grow to sort of cover more and more customers, we are going to have to add feature set. And that\u2019s sort of an order of operations say, what\u2019s the next thing that we need to go after and let\u2019s build that capability or buy that capability, put it in place, and then offer it to customers in as simple a way as possible.\nRon Josey: All right. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush securities. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal, please mute your line.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. Can you hear me now?\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nYgal Arounian: All right. Great. Thanks. So, I wanted to ask about a couple of big picture questions, one related to commerce and where you\u2019re doing there. And obviously, you\u2019re doing a lot, it\u2019s a feature that everything in space as kind of growing, pretty competitive across the space. You guys have always viewed yourselves as focused on that micro businesses. So, what you\u2019re doing here, when you think about SkyVerge and Sellbrite integration into Facebook and Instagram. do you guys see yourself playing in that market, in the e-commerce specifically? is it still kind of focused towards that micro-SMB? just does that change any of your philosophy in terms of go-to-market and who your target customer is? And then related to that, I think, a lot of investors think of GoDaddy\u2019s still very exposed to SMBs, which you are, and I think that\u2019s something, maybe some people have a hard time getting over in terms of the risk from COVID and businesses shutting down and the overall health. we saw in 3Q, new business applications for SMBs, but really businesses in general were up over 50%. So, there\u2019s a lot happening in that space too. Is there anything, you\u2019re seeing that gives you extra confidence, Aman, you touched on entrepreneurs and shutting down, and reopening, but what are you seeing within businesses, closing and opening and that overall environment that gives you maybe, more or less confidence than typical environments. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Ygal. Let me address sort of the target customer micro-SMB commerce, part of the question, and then take some of the pieces on turn and what exposure we see in the SMB space and then Ray can touch on it too. If we take a step back and go, what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers, is that customers our customers, people that have great relationships with GoDaddy are coming to us and saying, I want a commerce offering from you. We shared with you a quarter or two ago that 25% of customers signing up for websites, plus marketing or signing up for the commerce tier. These are people by themselves going there and saying, I want this product from GoDaddy. So, what we\u2019re focused on is when we see those early signals and we see people started to click stuff, we\u2019re like, this is an offering that we have the right to serve, right. This is a target segment of customers that have the best relationship with us, let\u2019s meet their needs. And my view on the competitive space and such is that there is so much opportunity still in the micro businesses, in the everyday entrepreneur space that we define that there is really a lot to do that. And my view is that as we look into the future, there\u2019s no difference between a micro business and an online micro business. Every micro business is going to be online, right. That\u2019s just how people are going to find things. That\u2019s just how people are going to want to transact, because it\u2019s going to be simpler for them and it will allow them to scale in a way that previously they couldn\u2019t. in terms of the exposure, and I\u2019ll just point again, to the steady churn rates at GoDaddy and this is the creativity of the customer. And maybe, for one click deeper, I\u2019ll turn it to Ray and say, do you want to talk a little bit more about that?\nRay Winborne: Yes. Ygal know, I mentioned this maybe, on the last call, but a lot of our competence is coming from the recurring nature of the business model. A couple of things that point out to your very point, our core customer is a solopreneur, right. it\u2019s one to five employees in a lot of cases. And when they get knocked down, they get backed up. We\u2019re providing them all the tools they need for $20, $25 a month. It\u2019s an incredibly valuable service through them. And it\u2019s one of the primary reasons our customer retention rates. It\u2019s been so strong for gosh, 20 plus years now. I think folks have consistently gotten it wrong about what\u2019s perceived to be as exposure to volatile small businesses. These are entrepreneurs, not necessarily small businesses. So, when one fails, they pick up the next idea. Aman hit on the renewal rates, they\u2019ve been very stable. The natural flow renewal event is roughly evenly spread over the year for us for 10 months in 2020, seven and a half months into the pandemic and renewal rates are holding. So, it\u2019s instilling confidence in us despite the uncertainty in the market.\nYgal Arounian: Great. Thanks so much, very helpful.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Ray, 11% bookings. I know you had a tougher 15% comp, I guess, with all the talk of e-comm and business ops, more attached. I think maybe, some thought you would see a little more acceleration than that. I\u2019m curious if you can just comment on the puts and takes, and kind of what you\u2019re seeing, I know it\u2019s all not going to flow in, in one quarter, but it seems like directionally, you\u2019re heading in the right direction.\nRay Winborne: Yes, Brent. Obviously, your recall last year was a really tough comp, there was over a point of lift and bookings related to credit card abuse. So, I think one, I would look at net bookings as a cleaner view of the growth, which is closer to 13% year-over-year. beyond that noise, I mean, Aman hammered it in the opening comments, we are seeing historic growth in new customer ads. But remember that new bookings are small relative to the base, it\u2019s roughly 10%. So, you\u2019re not going to see that inflection immediately, but we\u2019re super-critical for future growth. And there is strong demand for our offerings in the market. We\u2019re investing to maintain that while maintaining our threshold. So, you saw us pour on the marketing. we\u2019re seeing the results of that and new is growing very, very strong,\nBrent Thill: And you\u2019ve been fairly colorful in past calls. Just looking at what\u2019s been happening inside the quarter and linearity, was there any color just as it relates to, was it fairly steady on improvements throughout the quarter, or was it evenly based? How would you describe the linearity of the quarter into the start of this current quarter? Thanks, again.\nRay Winborne: Yes, I think what I would say is we hit the peak midsummer. The growth rates are still spectacular. I mean, these are record growth rates, but we\u2019re starting to see some seasonality, some waning and demand in the market, but I would still tell you, these are our historic growth rates that we\u2019re looking at right now.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thanks.\nRay Winborne: Bottom line, the guy that we put out reflects what we see from a trajectory standpoint for Q4.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, thanks for taking my questions, guys and a great quarter. Just wanted to ask on the guidance. So, full-year revenue expectation up a bit from your previous expectation and free cash flow expected to be in the sort of middle of the prior range. So, is this related to you, liking what you\u2019re seeing from the increased marketing spend and continuing to lean into that? Or is there something else going on and then on gross margins as websites, and e-commerce continue to be a faster growing component of your business? How do we think about that impact on the gross margin?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Matt, on the revenue growth, glad you\u2019re noticing we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re seeing there from an acceleration perspective and what we\u2019ve messaged in the past remains true. Any upside we see in cash flow, we\u2019re putting back into the business. We invested a lot in marketing this quarter. We\u2019ll invest again, in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re going to continue to lean in there as long as we\u2019re seeing the returns. on gross margins, don\u2019t forget, Q2 was weighed down by the COVID impacts at the top line with honestly, no relief in cost as we maintain salaries across the board. Q3 does include a benefit now consolidating GoDaddy registry, right. We talked about that acquisition and the benefits there of eliminating the domain costs that we formally paid out to an external party. My final thought on gross margins, though, right. We\u2019ve consistently messaged for forward modeling, keep us both safe by staying in that mid-60s. Yes, you\u2019re right. As we move more into these software centric offerings, those are higher margin, but we\u2019re continuing to put more into that bundle and we want to maintain the flexibility on pricing. So, I think it\u2019s still mid-60s is a good place for your models.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Two questions. One, any more color on the marketing that you\u2019re talking about, and are there channels that are working better for you than those in the past? I think in the middle of the year, there was probably some very good ROI out there to be had as those with the kind of a pull back and marketing from a lot of different verticals. I assume that the ROI has become a bit more back to pre-COVID norms, but just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of ROI and in channels. And then one other question related to marketing, and that is the lax customers \u2013 customers that were on the GoDaddy platform in the past. Have you had much success during this kind of time of must be really elevated demand for digital presence solutions, and you had success being able to go back to some of those lax customers and getting them to reengage with GoDaddy? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark. Regarding the first part of your question on the marketing cost and the return we\u2019re seeing, we continue to see strength on the brand side as we have historically core metrics like [indiscernible] brand awareness consideration, something we measure, which has for people like me, we continue to see sort of good performance and numbers heading in the right direction. Our performance marketing continues to show strength as well. You\u2019re right, there were some differences in the quarter and cost per impressions that have gone up a bit. We\u2019re still seeing good cost per impression for the business as a whole. And the overall result, as we mentioned, it has been amazing. We had \u2013 we have a super valuable cohort. It\u2019s the biggest cohort in the company\u2019s history, which is the third quarter cohort. And it\u2019s not as big as, we\u2019re growing every quarter, or every year. This cohort is 30% sort of more valuable than other cohorts. It\u2019s really, really a big increase in what we\u2019re seeing. In terms of the lapsed customers, and as we talked about, a lot of our customers stay with us even after their ventures go away. So we \u2013 some of that happens within our system already, it\u2019s not new, but I\u2019m not aware of anything special in terms of that changing during COVID, but I\u2019ll turn it to Ray to see if there\u2019s something he wants to mention about that.\nRay Winborne: Yes. Mark, let me pull a little finer point on that. The growth in new purchases from the existing base is year-over-year relative to the trend before COVID not as high as we\u2019re seeing certainly in the new customers, but still solid growth year-over-year. So, definitely, demand spiked as well and the existing base.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Mark, please go ahead. Mark, please unmute your line.\nMark Zgutowicz: Sorry about that. A couple of questions on W + M and I got on the call just a little late, so I apologize if this question was also already asked, but just on the freemium side of things. I was curious what the read is initially on conversion and what sort of the dynamics that you\u2019re seeing. I know it\u2019s been a, I guess, a couple of quarters now, just sort of your thoughts on how that model has played out in the future. And then a second one is just in terms of trajectory, revenue trajectory of W + M over the next 12 months, is there a greater pricing component in the \u2013 I guess pricing unit next equation. And is that sort of required as you think about, your cops obviously will be heading against the summer comps if you will, is there necessarily a greater pricing mix necessary? Appreciate that. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Mark. On the freemium piece, yes, there are a couple of quarters in, and it\u2019s given us the confidence or the experiment has given us the confidence to continue to roll out freemium. It\u2019s still early to talk about specific metrics on that \u2013 on those cohorts. But generally we\u2019re happy with the experiment. This is the path forward for us, and we want more and more and more customers to be using our freemium products, and we will get better and better and better at converting them over time. The more features that that we\u2019re including in the freemium product, sort of the more usage we see we\u2019ll be able to optimize a number of things over time. In terms of pricing and I don\u2019t think we can comment much in terms of what pricing actions might be there in the \u2013 going into next year or what we need to do, but I\u2019ll turn it to Ray, to see if there\u2019s some commentary that he wants to include here.\nRay Winborne: Yes, Mark, I think if you look at the disclosures we made this quarter around those products, there\u2019s a mix of both volume, unit growth as well as positive mix. The percentage of customers coming in at the higher tiers that has been favorable since COVID hit. So that\u2019s helping as well, but, yes, no comments specific comments around what that will look back in the next 12 months.\nMark Zgutowicz: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak, please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey guys, can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner: Yes, we can.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Two questions. So first on the e-commerce side, you obviously improved the product pretty nicely and a lot of features said, and also have done a lot of integrations. When should we expect modernization initiatives, particularly in areas like payments shipping, potentially partnerships on fulfillment, and also seeing in a lot of other areas where some of your peers generate nice revenues. And then the second question is, a little bit related to the customer cohorts, given a big renewable base, it\u2019s some are harder for us to parse out, but can you provide some color on the quality of the customers that you\u2019ve seen over the last, three, four months in the more recent cohorts? How much is the art book higher compared to your typical customer? What\u2019s the term like, and what are the additional products that they are buying? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, I\u2019ll take the first and Ray can take the second. On the e-commerce side, Websites + Marketing is going amazingly well by itself and the commerce tier is growing much faster than Websites + Marketing overall. So, yes, we were improved. We\u2019ve improved the product. We continue to invest in it, and we\u2019re seeing good results there. Good demand from customers there. In terms of monetization options, Deepak, the focus for us right now is to get the scale, right? We have a great offering by making it easier for customers to use by getting them premium tiers, by inserting more and more capabilities for them by increasing usage, like now [ph], increasing the use of certain features. We are creating that surplus for the customer. And definitely, the areas that you talked about continue to be future opportunities for us, but it\u2019s an order of operations. First, we want to get the scale and we share the GMV numbers with you. And then we want to look at the future options of monetization. And then I\u2019ll turn it to Ray for the second question.\nRay Winborne: Yes. Obviously, let me talk about the size of the cohorts that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters being historically largest we\u2019ve seen, as far as performance, still, really early to be able to tell how they\u2019re going to perform over the longer period. We flashed up, a cohort we picked up in the great recession in 2008, you can see the long-term performance on that turned out to be right in line with other cohorts. So, I have no reason to suspect these cohorts are going to perform any differently, but we\u2019ll see over time. One thing I would point out is in these cohorts post-COVID, we are seeing a heavier mix of attachment for Websites + Marketing manage WordPress.\nDeepak Mathivanan: All right, thanks Ray, thanks Aman.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question here. I have two, if you could, certainly appreciate the record the customer growth you\u2019re seeing, but if I look at international in particular, it\u2019s the highest growth rate we\u2019ve seen in a year, two quarters of accelerating international growth. Could you just provide a little more color on, as you think about this, this record really strong customer growth, how much of it is coming from international and maybe what countries you\u2019re seeing adoption drive this acceleration?\nRay Winborne: Yes, Brent its broad-based, right. We started, increasing the stand on marketing when we saw demand spike back in May, June timeframe. And that was pretty evenly split domestic and international. So, the incremental spend is going towards both of those and obviously seeing some nice improvement in trajectory there. Nothing specific to any one geo it\u2019s strong around the world.\nBrent Bracelin: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, as we think about kind of ARR, I think you\u2019re talked about that $350 million a year, our business growing 40% year-over-year. How should we think about that growth profile on an organic basis? I assume there\u2019s some acquisition kind of revenue in there. So, as you just think about ARR kind of organic growth potential, how should we kind of think about that go forward?\nRay Winborne: Yes, vast majority of that\u2019s organic, right? Those acquisitions were both small on an ARR basis, less than 5%.\nBrent Bracelin: Okay, great. Super encouraging. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. I Think Naved \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to skip you for a second. Our next question comes through the line of Chris Kuntarich. Chris, please go ahead with your question from Deutsche Bank.\nChris Kuntarich: Hi, can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner: Yes, we can.\nChris Kuntarich: Great. Maybe just on one of your milestones, you guys talked about, business apps customers now over three million. So that\u2019s roughly give or take mid-teens a percentage of your total customers. I think back in 2015, you had talked about roughly a 30-year customers were buying hosting. So, maybe two questions around that. First being is a third of customers purchasing, hosting from you guys still the right way to think about it. And then second on business apps. How would you think about the opportunity to kind of close that penetration of your customers to more maybe in line with where a hosting penetration is with your customers? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, I think, Chris, we continue to see great growth with business apps. And that we were able to attach that product along with domains were able to have customers reach us and we\u2019re offering sort of best-in-class service for them offering for them both in terms of tool set and in terms of support. And it\u2019s hard for me to talk about how the percentages may line up over the next few years, but generally speaking, we feel we have a great product. We feel that customers are very appreciative to have it. We see really good responses in terms of NPS, from customers on this product set. So we \u2013 our intention is to continue to invest into it and make it easier and easier for customers to use. We\u2019ve had a couple of sort of innovative ways of being able to somewhat support customers so that customers can get themselves set up with email in a really, really simple way. And then I don\u2019t know Ray, if there\u2019s anything else, that some of the other comparisons, I don\u2019t know, Chris, that you can sort of \u2013 they\u2019re kind of apples and oranges in my mind, but really, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d add.\nRay Winborne: Yes. Chris, only you might put on top of that is that, our focus both from a product perspective and go to market right now is only the software products, right? That\u2019s I suppose, marketing and manage WordPress and then all of the marketing tools that go in with that marketing commerce tool. So, less focused on hosting whereas we may have quoted back years ago. We now have more prominent software products that we\u2019re pushing on the go to market.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nRay Winborne: You bet.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Glaser from JPMorgan. Drew, please go ahead.\nDrew Glaser: Hey, this is Drew on first Sterling. So another question on the hosting area. So given the positive results in Hosting and Presence, do you think that you guys have hit the bottom in that segment and could we see improved growth in that segment going forward?\nRay Winborne: Yes. Drew it\u2019s Ray. Obviously we saw a nice improvement, a lot of that being driven off the back of the growth in our software products there, I\u2019m still seeing headwinds and will until we laugh the restructuring actions we took in June. But I think, all clear as far as the pressure we\u2019re seeing there.\nDrew Glaser: Okay. Got it. And then secondly, so we\u2019re seeing a surge in new business applications, according to some government data. Are you guys seeing that benefit your business at all? Or could that start benefiting it and coming back?\nRay Winborne: Yes, I think the fact that we had a record organic net customer ad this quarter in the company\u2019s history tells you, we are seeing the demand.\nDrew Glaser: Got it. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. I think we don\u2019t have audio from Naved to apologies. Everyone, thank you so much for joining our call today. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. I\u2019ll just say a huge thank you to all GoDaddy employees all over the world for a strong quarter. And we\u2019re looking forward to the next quarter. Thank you very much.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ray Winborne",
            "content": "Hey, thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for what was a great quarter for GoDaddy and then provide our outlook for Q4. Q3 reflected a strong performance across the board with another record quarter of customer growth, an acceleration in top-line growth and margin expansion, and new customer bookings continue to hit records. while small relative to total bookings, they're an important contributor to future growth. We've also continued to experience low customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewal rates, proof points to the durability of the business model. Total revenue came in at $844 million growing 11% year-over-year while currency impacts were negligible. growth rates accelerated across all three product categories and reaccelerated in our international business. Business applications was our fastest growing product line increasing 19% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. We delivered 12% growth in domains across new registrations, strong renewals and aftermarket sales. And finally, Hosting and Presence grew 6%. inside that, Aman highlighted the tremendous growth in products comprising our website creation platforms. In contrast, it also reflects a headwind from the GoDaddy social product due to the elimination of the outbound sales force in June. Total bookings grew to $945 million rising 11% year-over-year while currency impacts were negligible. strength in bookings was broad-based across products and geographies as our brand and product offerings positioned us well to capture demand as businesses continue their digital transformation. For many small businesses establishing an online presence was once seen as a competitive advantage. It's now table stakes. gross margin came in at 66% in a quarter, a 40 basis point expansion year-over-year. we also delivered operating leverage as the June restructuring actions reduced costs and care while G&A continued to benefit from both scale and lower discretionary expenses. As we highlighted on the second quarter call, we stepped up our investment in marketing to capture market demand resulting in a $36 million year-over-year increase in marketing expense. We've been able to elevate our investment while remaining within our target months to break even and customer acquisition costs even as we saw increased competition and performance advertising channels, and we'll continue to invest in marketing as long as we're meeting our return metrics. the net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $199 million in Q3, or approximately two points of margin expansion over last year. Moving to cash flow, unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, growing 17% year-over-year with margin expansion of over a point. trailing 12 month unlevered free cash flow was over $800 million and margin topped 25% illustrating both the size and scale of this business. Now, on to the balance sheet. we finished Q3 with $622 million in cash and total liquidity of over $1.2 billion. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions, issuing a new $750 million, seven-year term loan with an all-in yield of 2.7%. A record for a BB rated company. with this issuance, net debt stands at $2.5 billion or about three times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. That's the middle of our targeted range of two to four times and we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. If you have our ability to deleverage, this leaves more than ample liquidity to fund the business, execute the strategy and pursue our stated capital allocation priorities. Now, I want to take a moment to reiterate that any potential increases to the corporate tax rate will not have an immediate impact on GoDaddy's cash flow. As a reminder, given our net operating loss position, we don't expect to pay U.S. cash taxes before 2027, a higher corporate tax rate would however enhance the value of the recent settlement of the TRA. For example, a 28% rate increases the future tax savings associated with the TRA attributes by over $700 million, further enhancing the already strong returns on the settlement. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet and has enabled us to execute across to our capital allocation priorities in 2020, including completing four acquisitions, repurchasing, nearly 6% of our outstanding equity and settling the TRA. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that arises and will continue to be proven allocators of capital in pursuit of long-term growth and leverage free cash flow per share. With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook. We expect total revenue of approximately $865 million, or 11% growth year-over-year. You should expect double-digit growth in domains, mid single-digit growth in Hosting and Presence, and high-teens growth in Business Applications. Remember those products that relied on the outbound calling motion like GoDaddy social disproportionately impact the Hosting and Presence line. on unlevered free cash flow, we expect 2020 to land at approximately $820 million, the midpoint of our previous guidance range. As a reminder, Q4 has a highly anomalous 27th pay period this year, without which our unlevered free cash flow guide would have been approximately $18 million higher. In closing, digital migration is definitely an accelerating trend and it's here to stay. Our business is well-positioned to meet the needs of entrepreneurs around the globe as they bring their ideas to life online. GoDaddy has long been known as an industry leader with profitable growth at scale, now with a set of subscription software tools, enabling websites, content creation, and commerce, that's approaching $350 million in annual recurring revenue. We're as confident as we've ever been that we can continue to grow, take, share, and generate significant cash flow. with that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open up the call for questions. Hey, Jason. it's Ray, ARR is not apples-to-apples, obviously, with booking. So, it's cash versus revenue, but really happy with what we're seeing there from those products. From a booking's perspective while we're growing at relatively similar levels. And Ron, it's Ray. I want to clarify one point on that, within our customer count number, does not include freemium. Those are paid only subscriptions. So that record organic growth is for paid subscriptions, not freemium. Yes. Ygal know, I mentioned this maybe, on the last call, but a lot of our competence is coming from the recurring nature of the business model. A couple of things that point out to your very point, our core customer is a solopreneur, right. it's one to five employees in a lot of cases. And when they get knocked down, they get backed up. We're providing them all the tools they need for $20, $25 a month. It's an incredibly valuable service through them. And it's one of the primary reasons our customer retention rates. It's been so strong for gosh, 20 plus years now. I think folks have consistently gotten it wrong about what's perceived to be as exposure to volatile small businesses. These are entrepreneurs, not necessarily small businesses. So, when one fails, they pick up the next idea. Aman hit on the renewal rates, they've been very stable. The natural flow renewal event is roughly evenly spread over the year for us for 10 months in 2020, seven and a half months into the pandemic and renewal rates are holding. So, it's instilling confidence in us despite the uncertainty in the market. Yes, Brent. Obviously, your recall last year was a really tough comp, there was over a point of lift and bookings related to credit card abuse. So, I think one, I would look at net bookings as a cleaner view of the growth, which is closer to 13% year-over-year. beyond that noise, I mean, Aman hammered it in the opening comments, we are seeing historic growth in new customer ads. But remember that new bookings are small relative to the base, it's roughly 10%. So, you're not going to see that inflection immediately, but we're super-critical for future growth. And there is strong demand for our offerings in the market. We're investing to maintain that while maintaining our threshold. So, you saw us pour on the marketing. we're seeing the results of that and new is growing very, very strong, Yes, I think what I would say is we hit the peak midsummer. The growth rates are still spectacular. I mean, these are record growth rates, but we're starting to see some seasonality, some waning and demand in the market, but I would still tell you, these are our historic growth rates that we're looking at right now. Bottom line, the guy that we put out reflects what we see from a trajectory standpoint for Q4. Yes. Mark, let me pull a little finer point on that. The growth in new purchases from the existing base is year-over-year relative to the trend before COVID not as high as we're seeing certainly in the new customers, but still solid growth year-over-year. So, definitely, demand spiked as well and the existing base. Yes, Mark, I think if you look at the disclosures we made this quarter around those products, there's a mix of both volume, unit growth as well as positive mix. The percentage of customers coming in at the higher tiers that has been favorable since COVID hit. So that's helping as well, but, yes, no comments specific comments around what that will look back in the next 12 months. Yes. Obviously, let me talk about the size of the cohorts that we've seen over the last couple of quarters being historically largest we've seen, as far as performance, still, really early to be able to tell how they're going to perform over the longer period. We flashed up, a cohort we picked up in the great recession in 2008, you can see the long-term performance on that turned out to be right in line with other cohorts. So, I have no reason to suspect these cohorts are going to perform any differently, but we'll see over time. One thing I would point out is in these cohorts post-COVID, we are seeing a heavier mix of attachment for Websites + Marketing manage WordPress. Yes, Brent its broad-based, right. We started, increasing the stand on marketing when we saw demand spike back in May, June timeframe. And that was pretty evenly split domestic and international. So, the incremental spend is going towards both of those and obviously seeing some nice improvement in trajectory there. Nothing specific to any one geo it's strong around the world. Yes, vast majority of that's organic, right? Those acquisitions were both small on an ARR basis, less than 5%. Yes. Chris, only you might put on top of that is that, our focus both from a product perspective and go to market right now is only the software products, right? That's I suppose, marketing and manage WordPress and then all of the marketing tools that go in with that marketing commerce tool. So, less focused on hosting whereas we may have quoted back years ago. We now have more prominent software products that we're pushing on the go to market. You bet. Yes. Drew it's Ray. Obviously we saw a nice improvement, a lot of that being driven off the back of the growth in our software products there, I'm still seeing headwinds and will until we laugh the restructuring actions we took in June. But I think, all clear as far as the pressure we're seeing there. Yes, I think the fact that we had a record organic net customer ad this quarter in the company's history tells you, we are seeing the demand."

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'm excited to share the details on a record quarter for GoDaddy. Before we get started, though, I want to announce a change to our leadership team. Andrew Low Ah Kee, our Chief Operating Officer is leaving GoDaddy effective November 13, after nearly a decade with the company. As a colleague and friend, I'm grateful for his significant contributions over the years. He was a key part of building the great company we have today, and I wish him all the best in his new adventure, which will be announced over the next few days. We stand today with a deep leadership bench, including both tenured and new leaders organized to deliver on the needs of our customers and our strategic priorities. With this full complement of leaders in place, we will make a few adjustments, but we will not backfill the COO role. This will allow for a seamless transition so we can stay focused on executing against our strategy, and every day our passion for that strategy grows as more entrepreneurs trust and partner with GoDaddy to start with a dream and then create and grow that dream. We are pleased with our progress, and today I would like to highlight three key areas. First, our strong execution against our strategy with a few notable milestones. Second, our continued progress in online presence solutions, including leaning into commerce capabilities. And third, our continued investment in marketing to capture demand. Q3 was another record quarter of customer growth, and we are seeing sustained momentum into October. In Q3, we once again, added over 400,000 net new customers while also seeing improved customer retention. We continue to see increased demand for online solutions due to the pandemic and coupled with higher marketing spend our website traffic has increased by an average of 20% year-over-year since April. We have seen increased adoption of our website creation platform, websites plus marketing and managed WordPress as well as our content and commerce tools, Over and Sellbrite. As an additional insight into this part of the business, we are excited to share that together this solution reached an annualized recurring revenue of nearly $350 million in Q3 growing at approximately 40% year-over-year. This group of products now account for more than 2.2 million subscriptions growing over 20% year over year. Additionally, this quarter we saw an acceleration of Sellbrite's GMV growth between websites plus marketing and Sellbrite GoDaddy now has more than $4.5 billion of annualized GMV transacting through our platforms, growing at nearly 80% year-over-year. These proof points reinforce our strategy of driving scale in the growth phase for customers by focusing on commerce. Business applications as a product line continued to accelerate in the third quarter, surpassing the milestone of 3 million customers with nearly 9 million seats of email. Best of all, these numbers continue to grow at a healthy pace. While we're pleased with the growth in these key areas, we're not resting on our laurels. We're driving product enhancements and increasing our marketing efforts to facilitate profitable long-term growth. We continue to charge towards the massive opportunities of content creation and commerce. This quarter, we accomplished this through deep partnership integrations, internally developed software releases, and an important commerce acquisition. In partnerships, we recently announced a deeper integration with Facebook's business extension, GoDaddy websites plus marketing customers can now create shoppable posts as well as set up shops on both Instagram and Facebook with automatic syncing between both platforms offering yet another channel for our customers to easily sell their products. Additionally, our new partnership with Vimeo allows customers to upload, preview, and insert videos, including using a video as a header to their website. We've also continued to accelerate our velocity internally, delivering a busy product launch schedule in the quarter. We released a full integration of our Over app within websites plus marketing a short few months into the acquisition, making it even easier for customers to market their businesses with creative content. This seamlessly intuitive experience has driven over 50% growth in posts. We've also extended the Over app across 12 new languages giving more customers access to this powerful set of tools. Additionally, GoDaddy released a powerful social composer dashboard in websites plus marketing, giving customers a single place to rapidly create polished social content and view and schedule their social posts across connected social media platforms. What's more, users can track the performance metrics of each post by platform. We also introduced a simple and intuitive one page e-commerce template in websites plus marketing, which has quickly become our most popular template and it has reduced time to publish for our customers by 40%. Continuing on the theme of commerce, we launched our online store capabilities in Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Chile positioning GoDaddy to serve customers in these markets. We also continue to innovate for our domains customers. In Q3, we introduced revamped box search and file upload tools for domain investors and rolled out free global WHOIS masking and new paid security services with greater domain protection. And we're super excited to welcome the SkyVerge team with nearly 60 WooCommerce extensions spanning payments, email marketing and memberships, SkyVerge is a leading WooCommerce product developer. This acquisition furthers our commitment in WordPress to help entrepreneurs and web professionals succeed online with high performance stores that are feature rich and quick to build. Lastly, in Q2, we talked about our plan to delever marketing for as long as we continue to see returns on our investments. While the investment increased, we also delivered another record quarter for both customer ads and total cohort size. Obviously, it's something we're quite pleased to see, particularly as we've coupled these strong marketing gains alongside the great product enhancements we've talked about today. In closing, our focus is to build simple and easy to use tools with a focus on helping everyday entrepreneurs succeed. Online commerce and marketing are areas where this need has become significantly more pronounced in 2020. We are seeing rapid adoption of these new tools, giving us the opportunity to help more customers succeed, solid execution in an elevated demand environment powered a strong third quarter. We are poised for sustainable, profitable long-term growth, and we continue to be confident in our ability to hit our 4-1-1 target in 2022. With that, here's Ray. Hey, Jason. Thanks for that question. This is Aman. When we look at the third quarter, it represents record organic net sub growth for GoDaddy. We're really happy with the progress here and as we look at Q2, like we said, in some of our prepared remarks, October continued to be in line with September and did really well year-over-year as well. And in terms of churn rates, they continue to be stable slightly better. Just going back to the idea that our customers truly are the everyday entrepreneurs, and if they hit roadblocks, they're creative, they innovate, and they start something else and get on with it. And then, I'll turn it to Ray for maybe a little bit more color and to your second question on the $350 million. Yes. let's take the specific examples from previous quarters, and then I'll briefly touch on SkyVerge and how we look at the funnel. Our goal bringing in over, bringing in the experience from Uniregistry was that we wanted to bring to the GoDaddy family companies, teams that were building amazing experiences for customers, sort of best-in-class experiences. And then we want to take those experiences and bring them into our mainstream products like Websites + Marketing. So, when we talk about Over's integration, it's all very new right now. So, it's less about what subscriptions it's driving, and it's more about what level of engagement we're getting from the functionality we're putting out there. For example, with the Over integration, there was a 50% increase in posts, sort of content creation and people posting that content on social media which shows immediate customer value. And that's our core formula, right. We want to introduce these pieces whether it is Vimeo or others into the core experience, add the right place. It's not early in the funnel. It's as these customers are using these products, it shows up in a simple way at the right place, and it's just intuitive for the customer to use it. And as we continue to create customer value, over time we can turn it into shareholder value by sort of moving people through the tiers, by taking pricing actions and such, but the first step is really creating customer value. And in terms of SkyVerge, it's the same formula, SkyVerge team is fantastic in the WooCommerce space, and they have 60 plug-ins. they just are completely focused on building the best experience for customers, and it's super new right now, but well you can expect the same thing from us that it will become part of our managed WordPress experience, and it will just be simple for customers in terms of their commerce experience with WooCommerce as well. to touch on the funnel just slightly, keep in mind that as we add these capabilities, they are coming in at the right place where the customer is using the product, they \u2013 these things don't sort of in a sense; clutter the buying experience or the freemium experience in any way. In fact, if anything, as we layer on more and more capability and provide it as part of the freemium package, it \u2013 we feel it encourages people to use the product because they've got more functionality that they can use as part of the product. Yes. Happy to do that, Ron. Thanks for the question. on the first piece about the $350 million and just the color, we're super-excited about that part of the business and how quickly, it's growing, I think I'm blanking on the exact word you said, but just on the second part of your question, when I look at the sub's growth, what I'm really focused on is are we providing the customers the product that they can try out? And as an example, you mentioned, Sellbrite. Sellbrite is doing really, really well, right. The GMV growth that we're seeing, it's fantastic, but it's because we're getting the product in the hands of customers and more, and of merchants are quickly using, Sellbrite. by the way, we're seeing the same in Websites + Marketing. freemium means that more customers are using it. And yes, we're a couple of quarters in and what that's done is it's given us enough confidence that we are rolling the freemium piece out sort of 10% to 20% at a time. It's not 100% percent in the U.S. yet as we get into every part of our website and our sales path, that's the place we're going into. Yes. And I'll also clarify the numbers that we gave for subscriptions. The $2.2 million doesn't include subscriptions for over or Sellbrite. Those are core Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. And what we say, what we believe is that over and Sellbrite sort of the customers use that as part of our core platform. And then you asked the question, fixed to hit back to me around gaps, in our offering. the commerce offering is driving a ton of that growth in those suite of products, right. So that's really fantastic and we serve the needs of a certain set of customers really well already. The way I think about it is that as we grow to sort of cover more and more customers, we are going to have to add feature set. And that's sort of an order of operations say, what's the next thing that we need to go after and let's build that capability or buy that capability, put it in place, and then offer it to customers in as simple a way as possible. Yes. Thanks, Ygal. Let me address sort of the target customer micro-SMB commerce, part of the question, and then take some of the pieces on turn and what exposure we see in the SMB space and then Ray can touch on it too. If we take a step back and go, what we're seeing in the numbers, is that customers our customers, people that have great relationships with GoDaddy are coming to us and saying, I want a commerce offering from you. We shared with you a quarter or two ago that 25% of customers signing up for websites, plus marketing or signing up for the commerce tier. These are people by themselves going there and saying, I want this product from GoDaddy. So, what we're focused on is when we see those early signals and we see people started to click stuff, we're like, this is an offering that we have the right to serve, right. This is a target segment of customers that have the best relationship with us, let's meet their needs. And my view on the competitive space and such is that there is so much opportunity still in the micro businesses, in the everyday entrepreneur space that we define that there is really a lot to do that. And my view is that as we look into the future, there's no difference between a micro business and an online micro business. Every micro business is going to be online, right. That's just how people are going to find things. That's just how people are going to want to transact, because it's going to be simpler for them and it will allow them to scale in a way that previously they couldn't. in terms of the exposure, and I'll just point again, to the steady churn rates at GoDaddy and this is the creativity of the customer. And maybe, for one click deeper, I'll turn it to Ray and say, do you want to talk a little bit more about that? Yes. Matt, on the revenue growth, glad you're noticing we're happy with what we're seeing there from an acceleration perspective and what we've messaged in the past remains true. Any upside we see in cash flow, we're putting back into the business. We invested a lot in marketing this quarter. We'll invest again, in the fourth quarter and we're going to continue to lean in there as long as we're seeing the returns. on gross margins, don't forget, Q2 was weighed down by the COVID impacts at the top line with honestly, no relief in cost as we maintain salaries across the board. Q3 does include a benefit now consolidating GoDaddy registry, right. We talked about that acquisition and the benefits there of eliminating the domain costs that we formally paid out to an external party. My final thought on gross margins, though, right. We've consistently messaged for forward modeling, keep us both safe by staying in that mid-60s. Yes, you're right. As we move more into these software centric offerings, those are higher margin, but we're continuing to put more into that bundle and we want to maintain the flexibility on pricing. So, I think it's still mid-60s is a good place for your models. Thank you, Mark. Regarding the first part of your question on the marketing cost and the return we're seeing, we continue to see strength on the brand side as we have historically core metrics like [indiscernible] brand awareness consideration, something we measure, which has for people like me, we continue to see sort of good performance and numbers heading in the right direction. Our performance marketing continues to show strength as well. You're right, there were some differences in the quarter and cost per impressions that have gone up a bit. We're still seeing good cost per impression for the business as a whole. And the overall result, as we mentioned, it has been amazing. We had \u2013 we have a super valuable cohort. It's the biggest cohort in the company's history, which is the third quarter cohort. And it's not as big as, we're growing every quarter, or every year. This cohort is 30% sort of more valuable than other cohorts. It's really, really a big increase in what we're seeing. In terms of the lapsed customers, and as we talked about, a lot of our customers stay with us even after their ventures go away. So we \u2013 some of that happens within our system already, it's not new, but I'm not aware of anything special in terms of that changing during COVID, but I'll turn it to Ray to see if there's something he wants to mention about that. Thanks Mark. On the freemium piece, yes, there are a couple of quarters in, and it's given us the confidence or the experiment has given us the confidence to continue to roll out freemium. It's still early to talk about specific metrics on that \u2013 on those cohorts. But generally we're happy with the experiment. This is the path forward for us, and we want more and more and more customers to be using our freemium products, and we will get better and better and better at converting them over time. The more features that that we're including in the freemium product, sort of the more usage we see we'll be able to optimize a number of things over time. In terms of pricing and I don't think we can comment much in terms of what pricing actions might be there in the \u2013 going into next year or what we need to do, but I'll turn it to Ray, to see if there's some commentary that he wants to include here. Yes, I'll take the first and Ray can take the second. On the e-commerce side, Websites + Marketing is going amazingly well by itself and the commerce tier is growing much faster than Websites + Marketing overall. So, yes, we were improved. We've improved the product. We continue to invest in it, and we're seeing good results there. Good demand from customers there. In terms of monetization options, Deepak, the focus for us right now is to get the scale, right? We have a great offering by making it easier for customers to use by getting them premium tiers, by inserting more and more capabilities for them by increasing usage, like now [ph], increasing the use of certain features. We are creating that surplus for the customer. And definitely, the areas that you talked about continue to be future opportunities for us, but it's an order of operations. First, we want to get the scale and we share the GMV numbers with you. And then we want to look at the future options of monetization. And then I'll turn it to Ray for the second question. Yes, I think, Chris, we continue to see great growth with business apps. And that we were able to attach that product along with domains were able to have customers reach us and we're offering sort of best-in-class service for them offering for them both in terms of tool set and in terms of support. And it's hard for me to talk about how the percentages may line up over the next few years, but generally speaking, we feel we have a great product. We feel that customers are very appreciative to have it. We see really good responses in terms of NPS, from customers on this product set. So we \u2013 our intention is to continue to invest into it and make it easier and easier for customers to use. We've had a couple of sort of innovative ways of being able to somewhat support customers so that customers can get themselves set up with email in a really, really simple way. And then I don't know Ray, if there's anything else, that some of the other comparisons, I don't know, Chris, that you can sort of \u2013 they're kind of apples and oranges in my mind, but really, I don't know what you'd add. Thank you, Christie. I'll just say a huge thank you to all GoDaddy employees all over the world for a strong quarter. And we're looking forward to the next quarter. Thank you very much."

With that, here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. Since March, there has been a massive acceleration in the shift to digital for small businesses around the world. Again and again, we hear from customers how vital it is in this time of global economic uncertainty for them to have both a dedicated website for their business and the tools to help them reach their customers. We consider it a privilege to serve millions of everyday entrepreneurs worldwide as we strive to help them build their businesses and refashion the economics of their communities.  As many companies benefit from the digital acceleration, I am excited that GoDaddy has continued to gain share. I want to start today by acknowledging GoDaddy team members. The level of activity in our business and our operations are at their highest, unmatched by the personal challenges all of us face in the current environment.  In June, we announced a restructuring of our outbound sales team. And while it is always difficult to part ways with team members, we are grateful for their contribution over the years. Our team members are working hard and have adapted quickly to address the rapidly changing landscape.  The strong financial results for Q2 speak for themselves. We are pleased with the results and more importantly, with our position to grow with our customers well into the future. We are seeing strength across many parts of our business, and I want to highlight 3 items in particular. First, GoDaddy surpassed the significant milestone of 20 million paying customers. In Q2, we added more than 400,000 customers, delivering the strongest quarter of net customer growth in our 20-year history, aside from when we acquired HEG. This was driven by favorable trends, including stable retention rates and record gross customer adds in the quarter. Both of these trends were impacted positively by the strong market demand coupled with investments in marketing. We will continue to invest in marketing for as long as the returns stay within our threshold.  Second, we continue to create demonstratable value for existing and new customers by adding features and functionality to our products, such as marketing tools, video streaming, security options and bulk purchase experiences. We also made it easier for our customers to use and experiment with our products. We added a freemium experience for Websites + Marketing in Q1. And in Q2, we added Sellbrite e-commerce offering to the freemium lineup.  Third, we took a set of decisive actions from a position of strength to further optimize our business for long-term growth and cash flow generation. As mentioned, in June, we restructured our U.S. outbound sales team as its sales motion had become unsustainable due to COVID-19. And today, we fully settled the TRA at an attractive return profile while preserving both our liquidity and our ability to further invest going forward.  Lastly, we are happy to announce that we have closed on the acquisition of Neustar's registry business, and we look forward to unlocking value through vertical integration in the domain space. Ray will provide more details on these topics in his remarks.  Let's dig into customer growth and creating value for customers. Wow, second quarter of 2020, net new customers growing over 200% year-over-year getting us to 20 million paying customers. Lots of fantastic 2s and 0s in that sentence. It demonstrates just how much GoDaddy has grown since becoming a public company 5 years ago. In fact, in those short 5 years, we added nearly 7 million customers. GoDaddy continues to attract new customers to the ecosystem at a rapid pace, and those customers are seeing real value. Our retention rates are consistently high and continually stable, an ongoing testament to both the value and the criticality of our products and services to the small businesses we serve.  We continue to be the global leader in the green phase where customers name their ideas. In recent months, we brought together the greatest strength and capabilities of GoDaddy and the Uniregistry business, forming the GoDaddy Corporate Domains team. We added best-in-class new functionality for bulk purchasers, and our sales teams signed their first deals together. We also continue to see strength in primary domain sales, domain add-on and aftermarket transactions. How a business shows up online matters more now than ever before. And this is one of the reasons you continue to see our Domains segment growing more than double the industry growth.  While we love our outsized growth in the green phase with its $5 billion TAM, we are most excited about how Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress allow us to pursue the $175 billion TAM within the create and grow phases where everyday entrepreneurs build their ventures. Our customers want to do more with us. And we continue to invest in features and functionality that will let them accomplish this, especially in marketing and commerce.  In Q2, annualized recurring revenue in Websites + Marketing grew approximately 60% year-over-year. The common tier of our Websites + Marketing product accelerated even more quickly over the last few months, with net adds for our commerce tier growing 60% quarter-over-quarter and almost 90% year-over-year. In fact, 25% of new Websites + Marketing subscribers are opting for the commerce tier at nearly double the historical adoption rate, making it a bigger part of our [indiscernible]. With our commerce tier of Websites + Marketing for $25 per month, everyday entrepreneurs get a strong set of simple, easy-to-use tools to build their ventures online. Bundled with that is search engine optimization, best-in-class platform integrations with unlimited posting and tools for selling, including fee listings on Google, enhanced local delivery options and 1 year of branded e-mail. All of that backed with our award-winning guidance delivered 24/7 by our Care Guides worth hundreds of dollars all included.  For our customers, beautiful, engaging content is at the heart of their marketing. The GoDaddy offering with Over lets them do just that. In June alone, more than 14 million pieces of content were created and exported. That doubled year-over-year. The pace of user growth also accelerated. That doubled quarter-over-quarter with more than 1.7 million users engaging with Over every month. We are very excited to get the full functionality embedded in Websites + Marketing.  GoDaddy is the only company whose strength in create and grow transcends both captive CMS and WordPress. As a global champion for WordPress and the largest WordPress host, we are excited to bring new capabilities to the WordPress ecosystem. Already, our efforts in improving ease-of-use for WordPress are showing strong results. There are nearly 8,000 themes available in WordPress, and our Go Theme has quickly risen into the top 8. We are proud to be part of the open source WordPress community and the continued growth we see in Managed WordPress is great encouragement for us to continue to invest in the product.  We also saw Business Applications growth reaccelerate to 18% year-over-year, and that goes back to the frequently changing circumstances in which our customers find themselves today. Many of our customers relied on in-person interactions or inbound phone calls to brick-and-mortar stores as the means for their customers to engage with them. With many of those storefronts closed, customers have been adopting branded e-mail as an additional means to communicate with their customers. This is yet another way GoDaddy can help everyday entrepreneurs thrive while driving growth in our business as well.  Our focus on adding customer value in a strong demand environment powered a strong second quarter and sets us up well for the rest of the year. We are poised for sustainable, profitable growth for the long term and continue to be confident in our ability to hit our 4-1-1 goal, $4 billion in revenue, $1.1 billion in unlevered free cash flow organically in 2022.  With that, here's Ray.\nRaymond Winborne: Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for what was a great quarter for GoDaddy and then provide our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Q2 reflected better-than-expected results on every key metric from top to bottom, as the business performed very well, setting us up for continued success through the remainder of the year and beyond. Aman mentioned customer growth, but we've also seen flat customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewals, proof points to the durability of the business model.  Total revenue came in at $806 million, growing over 10% on a constant currency basis, with 140 basis points of currency headwind, and we're seeing the strength globally with U.S. and international both growing at a 10% clip in constant currency. Looking at product categories, we delivered 11% growth in Domains on strength in new registrations, renewals and aftermarket sales. Hosting and Presence grew 4%. Inside that, we saw terrific growth in subscriptions of Websites + Marketing, along with the e-commerce solutions Aman talked about earlier. This line item also reflects the headwinds from our higher-priced GoDaddy social product, which was disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And finally, Business Applications growth deaccelerated to 18% year-over-year on higher demand for domain-based e-mail and productivity solutions.  Total bookings grew to $936 million, rising 12% on a constant currency basis, with roughly 1.5 points of currency headwinds. The strength was broad-based across products and geographies. We were well positioned to capture demand as businesses adapted their models, establishing an online presence in response to the COVID pandemic. And we've seen incredible response to our Websites + Marketing offering as we introduced the freemium option early on in Q2. Gross margin was 64% in the quarter, down slightly sequentially as we saw a mix shift towards the Domains and Business Applications product lines. For modeling purposes, we anticipate the product mix and in turn, the gross margin, to look similar in the second half of the year. We delivered approximately 3 points of operating leverage year-over-year with G&A continuing to benefit from both scale and lower discretionary expenses. Leverage in G&A and care were slightly offset by the investment in marketing that we started to ramp in the second quarter. The net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $162 million in Q2 or approximately 2 points of margin expansion over last year.  Moving to cash flow. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $186 million, growing 11% year-over-year with unlevered free cash flow margin up about 30 bps year-over-year. Trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow was nearly $790 million, and margin topped 25%, illustrating both the size and scale of this business. Now I want to take a moment to discuss the specific financial impacts of the restructuring to our U.S. outbound sales team we announced at the end of June. We recorded a $39 million restructuring charge in Q2. None of those impacted had accepted other roles. 582 team members ultimately received the transition package with a combined dollar value of approximately $15 million, $10 million of which was recorded as a charge in Q2, while the remainder will hit in Q3. We also exited leased office space in Austin, and as a result, recognized an impairment charge of approximately $29 million of our right-to-use assets. Actual cash outlays for the restructuring will be excluded from future presentations of our unlevered free cash flow metric. And you can see in the full year guide, we plan to reallocate these go-to-market savings to other marketing activities.  Now on to the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with $773 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. Net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about 2x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, the low end of our targeted range. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. Earlier this week, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Neustar's registry business, our third completed acquisition this year. We look forward to welcoming Nicolai and team as we extend the value chain in the dream phase of the customer journey. We've completed the preliminary purchase accounting work and due to the magnitude of the adjustment to the deferred revenue balance, we expect the rebranded GoDaddy Registry to contribute minimal revenue in 2020. Our estimate of the contributions to unlevered free cash flow remains at less than $10 million for this year.  As announced today, we reached an agreement to settle our TRAs, eliminating $1.8 billion in future cash payments for a onetime payment of $850 million. This is a terrific outcome for GoDaddy. We feel great about this transaction because, one, at current tax rates, the implied rate of return exceeds our borrowing cost by 6 percentage points; and two, we believe it's likely that tax rates will go up in the future, so the actual savings will be much greater, further enhancing our returns. We'll fund this transaction with a combination of cash on hand and new debt. Post transaction, while the net leverage of roughly 3x, leaving us at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range with ample liquidity to fund the business, execute strategy and pursue our stated capital allocation priorities.  The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet. And when unique and attractive opportunities like the TRA arise, we have the flexibility to take advantage and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Before I get to the outlook, I want to take a moment and reflect on the financial progress GoDaddy has made in the last 5 years since our IPO in Q2 of 2015. Quite simply, our focus has been creating customer value, sharing in the economics of that value creation and being good stewards of the business. The proof points of the outcomes: since Q2 2015, we've increased customers by approximately 50%; we have increased revenue over 100%; and we've increased unlevered free cash flow by more than 200%. Pretty impressive growth statistics. And we're well positioned for the next 5 years. We will continue to be prudent allocators of capital in the pursuit of long-term growth and levered free cash flow per share.  With that, let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect total revenue of approximately $835 million or 10% growth year-over-year. For Q3, you should expect double-digit growth in Domains, mid-single-digit growth in Hosting and Presence and high-teens growth in Business Applications. Remember, those products that relied on the outbound calling motion like GoDaddy Social disproportionately impact the Hosting and Presence line. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, with bookings growth outpacing revenue by about 1 point. On unlevered free cash flow, we expect 2020 to land in a range of $815 million to $825 million, as go-to-market savings from the restructuring are reinvested to drive long-term growth.  As you can see in the Q2 numbers and the forward guidance, the current demand environment merits incremental investment so you should expect us to delever in marketing and tech and dev in the back half of 2020.  As a reminder, Q4 has a highly anomalous 27th pay period, without which our unlevered free cash flow guide would have been $18 million higher.  In closing, we're playing offense as GoDaddy continues to gain share in an industry experiencing an acceleration and an ongoing secular shift to online commerce. We are more confident than ever that our strong and predictable cash flow will allow us to take advantage of opportunities and create significant value for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders for years to come.  And now I'll turn it back to Aman before we open up the call for Q&A.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Ray. It has been 1 year since my first GoDaddy earnings call. In that year, I have talked to many everyday entrepreneurs and fallen in love with their story. I have seen an employee base that deeply cares about the mission of the company and has risen to unprecedented challenges. While there is still uncertainty ahead and no one has a crystal ball, I am inspired by the opportunity in front of us, and our path forward is clear. Our focus on customer success drives our continued development of world-class products. That, in turn, empowers everyday entrepreneurs to sell and thrive online.  We have an incredible brand that is only getting stronger. We have a resilient, recurring business model, and we will continue to be prudent stewards of the significant cash that GoDaddy generates, pursuing growth organically and inorganically for years to come.  GoDaddy is an amazing success story. We have a TAM of $180 billion and 20 million paying customers. And I feel like we're just getting started.  Operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nMark Grant: Operator, can we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask about a couple of things. So first is can you give us some color on the customer profile that you're seeing? The net adds of 400,000 was very strong. And like said, it's nearly 3x last year. How much of that on-ramp is coming from Domains? And how much of that would you say you can attribute to Websites + Marketing and then also some of the e-commerce products?  And then the second question is on the Hosting and Presence. Obviously, you're seeing nice tailwinds on the e-commerce and also websites. But the overall growth is 4%. I know it's impacted by the social offering and then also the do-it-for-me cleanup. But can you give some color on the size and growth of each bucket so we can think about the confidence inside this correctly?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Deepak. This is Aman. I can take the first part, and Ray can probably take the second. We're seeing customer growth across all the product categories. We saw growth in Domains. We -- as you see, we saw growth in the biz apps and Websites + Marketing, and Managed WordPress continue to grow at a healthy rate, right? So it's not really about one product or the other. We're seeing growth across all products, and it's a function of the demand environment and the marketing spend and the value that our products bring to our customers on sort of everyday basis. We're excited about the acceleration. And the quarter continue to improve for us, and we're excited about that. Ray, do you want to take the question?\nRaymond Winborne: The only thing I might tack on to that, Deepak, you may have heard Aman reference to it. We are super excited about the growth we're seeing in Websites + Marketing, 60% growth year-over-year in ARR. That is a fantastic growth rate, and so you could see the adoption and more excited about even the mix of SKUs within that adoption. So we've seen a nice uptake in e-commerce SKU takes, let's say, I think, 25% of folks taking that SKU now. So really excited about the progress we've seen there in that product.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Okay. Ray, if I can just follow-up on that. How much would you say the impact from the restructuring efforts is on the 3Q revenues? I mean, I know previously, you quantified it for 2Q. How should we think about that for 3Q?\nRaymond Winborne: Yes, if you think about 3Q and the rest of the year, you saw the impact of the headwinds in the second quarter, it's baked into that guidance for the rest of the year as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Pfau from William Blair.\nMatthew Pfau: Just wanted to hit on the premium offers that you've been providing on the websites business. Maybe you can just discuss how those have been performing relative to your expectations, both in terms of interest and conversion. And then what are your thoughts on using the strategy longer term, both for the existing products that you're offering it for or perhaps expanding the two additional ones?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Matt. The freemium offering is a quarter in, and we continue to be excited about how it's performing, both in terms of attracting registered users to come in and try the product and the conversion rates we're seeing. And so it's meeting our expectations, and we continue to drive improvements in it.  In terms of freemium as a model, we really feel that our customers more and more people need to be able to use our products. So the freemium model allows us to do that in a successful way. And one of the things you saw this quarter is that we added the freemium offering for Sellbrite, which is a product that allows micro small businesses to connect to many of the large platforms out there and get their products out there. So it's really a model that we're using for more and more products.  And one last thing to keep in mind is that when we talk about the 20 million customers, we're talking about paying customers. That does not include freemium customers in that number.\nAndrew Low Ah Kee: Matt, it's Andrew. I'll just tack on one other thing. Ray mentioned we're leaning into marketing. And obviously, we've got the convictions to lean into marketing based on what we're seeing in their early. So...\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. Just one quick follow-up. [Technical Difficulty] good based on the growth that you're seeing in the websites business. But what about visibility into the future quarters, are you able to get any idea in terms of predictability of what the conversion of some of those freemium users will be? And how does that perhaps help you in terms of the visibility in your business?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I think it's a bit too early to be able to sort of set the quarterly cohorts up. We're still, like I said, only a quarter in. But over the next few quarters, we'll definitely have a clearer idea of how those cohorts perform. Early indications, they continue to meet our expectations. So we're excited to continue to move forward on it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP.\nRonald Josey: Aman, you started off the call just talking about the massive acceleration of digital, and we're seeing that in your subscriber growth numbers, freemium, e-commerce adoption, et cetera. Just wanted to get your take on where do you think we are in the shift to digital and the importance of -- we just talked about importance of freemium but with 20 million subs and more freemium coming on, I just want to know, like, where do you -- curious of your thoughts on where you think we are in overall adoption of this digital transformation and where GoDaddy is there?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I do think that COVID-19 has pushed a number of people past the point of inertia where they were not adopting digital. Another way to say that is pull forward the TAM. So because people have no choice but to go digital to support their businesses, we're seeing people experimenting with ideas. We're seeing people come online, even though they had hesitated to do it in the past. When you look at that TAM of $180 billion, and it's just huge. This is a space with so many players there. And when I look at GoDaddy, I think we're really positioned well.  And when I talked in the script about I feel like we're on the start line, I look back at GoDaddy and see a leader in the dream phase, doing so well in the create phase over the last 2, 3 years. And now as we put more and more attention into the growth phase, customers want to do marketing tools with us, they want to do commerce with us, and we have good offerings for them. So the more we get our name out there related to those offerings, the more we improve those offerings, I expect GoDaddy to play a very significant role in that moving forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Jones from Citi.\nNicholas Jones: I guess just two. First on strategic acquisitions. I mean, how do you feel about the pipeline today given kind of market multiples? And any kind of thoughts kind of how you view the environment? And then the second question would be on kind of customer acquisition and increasing investment in advertising. How do you feel about kind of the, I guess, the advertising window? Are CPM lower today and you're able to be more aggressive? How long do you think that will last from kind of where we stand today? Any color there would be helpful.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. As you know, we've been quite active in the acquisition space over the last few months, just talking about closing Neustar today and super excited about that. Our pipeline continues to be healthy. And of course, valuations are what they are. But we continue to look for opportunities, which can add value to our customers and become part of the GoDaddy ecosystem.  And broadly speaking, we are looking for opportunities where customers get nonlinear value, and our brand extends to be able to offer that value to customers. That's kind of the lens we're looking things at. And there's a healthy pipeline.  In terms of customer acquisition, our customer acquisition costs actually went down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And part of that is the CPMs, but a big part of that is just demand and intent from customers.  So as we look forward, our commitment is that we'll continue to invest in marketing, looking at this demand, taking share within this demand as long as it meets our thresholds.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Aman, nice to see the Business Apps reaccelerate. I'm just curious when you look at the opportunity set ahead, it seems pretty massive. How are you gaining better awareness? And where are you finding the best areas for adoption? And then for Ray, can you -- maybe companies we -- I cover and check have been commenting on how things look in the month of July and August. I'm curious if you have any comments about how you exited the quarter. And was there a sugar high tail-off? Or are you still seeing the continued strength that you saw at the end of Q2?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. On the business apps, the focus for the teams there is to continually improve, not just sort of awareness of that product when people come to our site or through our marketing channels, but really, really reduce the friction in terms of activation, the friction in terms of fulfillment. So that adds a customer step into that product. They're able to really get value very, very quickly. And some of those efforts that we've been making over the last few quarters has started to show value.  Now clearly, part of the reacceleration here is the overall environment where customers are looking for avenues to contact their customers, and we've been telling them for years that if you use branded e-mail, you have many multiples more likely to get the attention of your customers than a regular e-mail address. And in a time like COVID, where our micro businesses, small businesses are looking to reach their customers, they're sort of thinking about all the things that we've been telling them. And we think we see that acceleration coming in Business Apps through that. And I'll turn it to Ray for sort of July and so on.\nRaymond Winborne: Yes. Brent, so good trends. As we look toward the quarter, it was nice progression, continued increase right up through June. I think if I recall back then, maybe it was Andrew that pointed it out on the last call saying that April -- the April cohort was our strongest we've seen in 10 years. May was better. June was better. And then we saw no slowdown in the July cohort. That should give you some sense of what we're seeing in the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jian Li from RBC.\nJian Li: Jian for Mark Mahaney. And congrats on the quarter. So just maybe piggybacking on the last answer, just given the accelerating trend you're seeing from -- in Q2 and into July, what assumptions are you baking into your Q3 guide in terms of the kind of new user growth? And what kind of macro assumptions are you baking into that? And I'm thinking that given your full year and Q3, are you assuming that macro getting better in Q4 and therefore, the higher price pressure that you're seeing that's in H&P right now will be more alleviated? I just want to see if you have any thoughts on that.\nRaymond Winborne: Yes. It's Ray. I'll take that one. Look, there's a lot of uncertainties at play right now. We're trying to call it like we see it, not being overly aggressive or conservative in the guide. It just reflects what we know right now and our sense of trajectory.  If you look at the guide we're giving, it does imply some acceleration from the pre-COVID Q1 number. Keep in mind, the back half of the year gets a little tougher on year-over-year comps. In the demand environment, it's obviously been great. Aman talked about some of the stats and metrics we're seeing. But we don't have perfect insight into how long or at what strength that's going to continue. We're always going to strive to do more, be better every day. But the guide is what we see happening, plus or minus.\nJian Li: Great. And if I may, a follow-up on the Neustar acquisition. I know it's early days, but have you looked at maybe medium term, the size of the opportunity there? And how should we think about kind of the margin accretion potential from Neustar?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I think we're just coming upon closing it, we -- just a couple of days in. So it's a bit too early to be talking about the medium-term return on Neustar. Suffice to say, we're super excited about being able to vertically integrate within the Domains space. It opens a lot of opportunity for us to create new offerings for customers to experiment at a pace and scale that we don't think the registry business has seen for many years. So that's the opportunity we're going after. And we'll be able to talk about it a lot more over the next quarter or so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ygal Arounian from Wedbush Securities.\nYgal Arounian: I want to ask Ron's question maybe slightly differently and how to think about the sort of pull forward and runway of increased need for digital presence relative to the 400,000 net new customers this quarter. As we look forward, is that a number that we should kind of continue to expect to be at that level? Are we at a new run rate for new customers for the time being too held back off a little bit? Is the mix of growth coming a little bit more from new customers or ARPU? Just how to think about and frame this discussion in terms of new customers going forward.  And then the second question, when you guys announced the restructuring without a lot of questions from investors around trying to understand exactly what the outbound sales team was versus the inbound sales team. So can you help just make sure to clarify and help investors understand what the outbound sales team was. Was it all related to GoDaddy Social? And then at the same time, what are you seeing from the inbound sales team in terms of productivity as we're continuing to work from home?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. If I got sort of three parts to that question: first, around net customer growth; the second around revenue breakdown subscribers versus ARPU; and third around outbound sales. Maybe I'll get started and Andrew and Ray can jump in.  On the net customer growth, obviously, we're super excited about the 400,000 number. It's massive. It's our best quarter ever if you take out the HEG acquisition. And it's really something that is a function of the demand environment we see and the work that GoDaddy has been doing. In terms of looking forward, as you know, we don't guide to net customer growth, but we do share that data with you over time, especially on a milestone basis. And given that this was such a big milestone, we felt that it would help sort of you see the things happening in the business.  In terms of the breakdown of subscribers versus ARPU, I think we continue to see that healthy mix. Obviously, the subscriber growth is very large. But we continue to see that, I would say, stable ARPU growth that this business has demonstrated for many years. So that's -- together, that's been really good.  In terms of the outbound sales motion, as we discussed, our outbound sales is a very particular motion. It was honed over the years. And COVID-19 did impact it significantly. But I'll turn it over to Andrew to share a bit more detail on it.\nAndrew Low Ah Kee: Yes. Our outbound sales team was a small portion of our overall care operations. We got a history, as you all know, of uniquely selling, whether in an inbound motion or in an outbound motion. That outbound motion was a discretionary one, right? The inbound one, we take a customer's call. We have an obligation to answer the phone when they call us. On the outbound side, that's a discretionary thing. And as we looked at the productivity challenges that we were facing and what we expected ahead, it made sense for us to stop that motion and reallocate that investment, as Ray mentioned, into other marketing activities. As we -- and that outbound team, yes, they focused on social, but they focused on a range of other higher-end products and services.  On the other side, with respect to productivity, we obviously took a hit there. As we've shared with you in the past, we've seen steady and continuous progress around improving it. We've embedded the level of productivity we expect to see into the guide that Ray mentioned. And importantly, we have seen consumer behavior change as we've gone through COVID in terms of how they choose to engage with care. Increasingly, it's around asynchronous chat, other digital channels, some of which we talked about in our Investor Day, but we're really seeing those different modes of engagement come to the fore in this current environment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: First, are there any key product holes you guys would flag in Websites + Marketing, where if you kind of either add a product or improve a part of it a lot, you feel like you can unlock meaningful new TAM or growth acceleration? And secondly, when you guys announced your deal with AWS, there was talk of kind of working together, maybe AWS selling some of GoDaddy services. Wondering if there's been any movement on that side of the relationship. Is that something we should think about for the future?\nAman Bhutani: When we think about Websites + Marketing and the opportunities, they're squarely in what we talked about, the grow phase for our customers. And 2 areas that we're investing in are marketing and commerce. To give you a bit flavor, marketing includes content. Marketing includes messaging, right? And when we did the Over acquisition, and we're bringing it into Websites + Marketing very, very quickly. So all of the great feature functionality engagement that Over has, all Websites + Marketing customers are going to have that this year very, very quickly.  Those marketing capabilities are really core to our micro businesses reaching their customers. And similarly, as we all know, commerce is a big part of it as well. And we have a great base offering in commerce. And the more our customers use us, the more we're adding features and functionality for them in the commerce space as well.  In terms of AWS, we've had some good milestones in terms of progress in our relationship there. But overall, it continues to be relatively small. We think it's a great sort of example of what GoDaddy can do for a big partner. But in the revenues -- in the total size of our revenues, it's a small item.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Naved Khan from SunTrust Robinson.\nNaved Khan: We've been renamed Truist Securities, so change of name. But I had a couple of questions. In your April update, you guys have -- had talked about some weakness in the Domains aftermarket. Curious to know if that still persists. The results kind of indicate it might have improved. And the other question I had was just around the -- your onboarding ramps for the new customer acquisition. Is it fair to assume that with the addition of the freemium offering and the revamp in the Websites + Marketing product, it's becoming more meaningful. Is it source of new customer acquisition versus maybe just a year ago?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, Naved, thanks for your question. On the aftermarket, like we said, we're seeing great traction in primary, secondary Domains sales. Overall, that business or that segment growing at 10% for us, as you know, growing much faster than double of the industry. So we're super happy with that. We did -- we had, in April, talked about some weakness in there. And there are pockets of different experiences by different countries that we're seeing. But overall, very happy with the results in that segment overall.  And in terms of freemium and Websites + Marketing, the 60% ARR number just says it all, right? We continue to see healthy growth in that business on a unit basis, on a revenue basis. Super excited about what it means for the future. And it's massive LTV, right? The Website + Marketing customer drives somewhere in the order of 10 to 25x the LTV than a Domains customer for us. So being in that space, being a big player in that space and gaining share in that space has been really good for us.\nOperator: And that concludes our questions today. I'll now turn the call back over to Aman Bhutani, CEO, for closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, and thank you all for joining on the call today. A big thanks to all GoDaddy team members all over the world for a great quarter, and look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raymond Winborne",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for what was a great quarter for GoDaddy and then provide our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Q2 reflected better-than-expected results on every key metric from top to bottom, as the business performed very well, setting us up for continued success through the remainder of the year and beyond. Aman mentioned customer growth, but we've also seen flat customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewals, proof points to the durability of the business model.  Total revenue came in at $806 million, growing over 10% on a constant currency basis, with 140 basis points of currency headwind, and we're seeing the strength globally with U.S. and international both growing at a 10% clip in constant currency. Looking at product categories, we delivered 11% growth in Domains on strength in new registrations, renewals and aftermarket sales. Hosting and Presence grew 4%. Inside that, we saw terrific growth in subscriptions of Websites + Marketing, along with the e-commerce solutions Aman talked about earlier. This line item also reflects the headwinds from our higher-priced GoDaddy social product, which was disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And finally, Business Applications growth deaccelerated to 18% year-over-year on higher demand for domain-based e-mail and productivity solutions.  Total bookings grew to $936 million, rising 12% on a constant currency basis, with roughly 1.5 points of currency headwinds. The strength was broad-based across products and geographies. We were well positioned to capture demand as businesses adapted their models, establishing an online presence in response to the COVID pandemic. And we've seen incredible response to our Websites + Marketing offering as we introduced the freemium option early on in Q2. Gross margin was 64% in the quarter, down slightly sequentially as we saw a mix shift towards the Domains and Business Applications product lines. For modeling purposes, we anticipate the product mix and in turn, the gross margin, to look similar in the second half of the year. We delivered approximately 3 points of operating leverage year-over-year with G&A continuing to benefit from both scale and lower discretionary expenses. Leverage in G&A and care were slightly offset by the investment in marketing that we started to ramp in the second quarter. The net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $162 million in Q2 or approximately 2 points of margin expansion over last year.  Moving to cash flow. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $186 million, growing 11% year-over-year with unlevered free cash flow margin up about 30 bps year-over-year. Trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow was nearly $790 million, and margin topped 25%, illustrating both the size and scale of this business. Now I want to take a moment to discuss the specific financial impacts of the restructuring to our U.S. outbound sales team we announced at the end of June. We recorded a $39 million restructuring charge in Q2. None of those impacted had accepted other roles. 582 team members ultimately received the transition package with a combined dollar value of approximately $15 million, $10 million of which was recorded as a charge in Q2, while the remainder will hit in Q3. We also exited leased office space in Austin, and as a result, recognized an impairment charge of approximately $29 million of our right-to-use assets. Actual cash outlays for the restructuring will be excluded from future presentations of our unlevered free cash flow metric. And you can see in the full year guide, we plan to reallocate these go-to-market savings to other marketing activities.  Now on to the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with $773 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. Net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about 2x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, the low end of our targeted range. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. Earlier this week, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Neustar's registry business, our third completed acquisition this year. We look forward to welcoming Nicolai and team as we extend the value chain in the dream phase of the customer journey. We've completed the preliminary purchase accounting work and due to the magnitude of the adjustment to the deferred revenue balance, we expect the rebranded GoDaddy Registry to contribute minimal revenue in 2020. Our estimate of the contributions to unlevered free cash flow remains at less than $10 million for this year.  As announced today, we reached an agreement to settle our TRAs, eliminating $1.8 billion in future cash payments for a onetime payment of $850 million. This is a terrific outcome for GoDaddy. We feel great about this transaction because, one, at current tax rates, the implied rate of return exceeds our borrowing cost by 6 percentage points; and two, we believe it's likely that tax rates will go up in the future, so the actual savings will be much greater, further enhancing our returns. We'll fund this transaction with a combination of cash on hand and new debt. Post transaction, while the net leverage of roughly 3x, leaving us at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range with ample liquidity to fund the business, execute strategy and pursue our stated capital allocation priorities.  The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet. And when unique and attractive opportunities like the TRA arise, we have the flexibility to take advantage and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Before I get to the outlook, I want to take a moment and reflect on the financial progress GoDaddy has made in the last 5 years since our IPO in Q2 of 2015. Quite simply, our focus has been creating customer value, sharing in the economics of that value creation and being good stewards of the business. The proof points of the outcomes: since Q2 2015, we've increased customers by approximately 50%; we have increased revenue over 100%; and we've increased unlevered free cash flow by more than 200%. Pretty impressive growth statistics. And we're well positioned for the next 5 years. We will continue to be prudent allocators of capital in the pursuit of long-term growth and levered free cash flow per share.  With that, let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect total revenue of approximately $835 million or 10% growth year-over-year. For Q3, you should expect double-digit growth in Domains, mid-single-digit growth in Hosting and Presence and high-teens growth in Business Applications. Remember, those products that relied on the outbound calling motion like GoDaddy Social disproportionately impact the Hosting and Presence line. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, with bookings growth outpacing revenue by about 1 point. On unlevered free cash flow, we expect 2020 to land in a range of $815 million to $825 million, as go-to-market savings from the restructuring are reinvested to drive long-term growth.  As you can see in the Q2 numbers and the forward guidance, the current demand environment merits incremental investment so you should expect us to delever in marketing and tech and dev in the back half of 2020.  As a reminder, Q4 has a highly anomalous 27th pay period, without which our unlevered free cash flow guide would have been $18 million higher.  In closing, we're playing offense as GoDaddy continues to gain share in an industry experiencing an acceleration and an ongoing secular shift to online commerce. We are more confident than ever that our strong and predictable cash flow will allow us to take advantage of opportunities and create significant value for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders for years to come.  And now I'll turn it back to Aman before we open up the call for Q&A. The only thing I might tack on to that, Deepak, you may have heard Aman reference to it. We are super excited about the growth we're seeing in Websites + Marketing, 60% growth year-over-year in ARR. That is a fantastic growth rate, and so you could see the adoption and more excited about even the mix of SKUs within that adoption. So we've seen a nice uptake in e-commerce SKU takes, let's say, I think, 25% of folks taking that SKU now. So really excited about the progress we've seen there in that product. Yes, if you think about 3Q and the rest of the year, you saw the impact of the headwinds in the second quarter, it's baked into that guidance for the rest of the year as well. Yes. Brent, so good trends. As we look toward the quarter, it was nice progression, continued increase right up through June. I think if I recall back then, maybe it was Andrew that pointed it out on the last call saying that April -- the April cohort was our strongest we've seen in 10 years. May was better. June was better. And then we saw no slowdown in the July cohort. That should give you some sense of what we're seeing in the business. Yes. It's Ray. I'll take that one. Look, there's a lot of uncertainties at play right now. We're trying to call it like we see it, not being overly aggressive or conservative in the guide. It just reflects what we know right now and our sense of trajectory.  If you look at the guide we're giving, it does imply some acceleration from the pre-COVID Q1 number. Keep in mind, the back half of the year gets a little tougher on year-over-year comps. In the demand environment, it's obviously been great. Aman talked about some of the stats and metrics we're seeing. But we don't have perfect insight into how long or at what strength that's going to continue. We're always going to strive to do more, be better every day. But the guide is what we see happening, plus or minus."

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. Since March, there has been a massive acceleration in the shift to digital for small businesses around the world. Again and again, we hear from customers how vital it is in this time of global economic uncertainty for them to have both a dedicated website for their business and the tools to help them reach their customers. We consider it a privilege to serve millions of everyday entrepreneurs worldwide as we strive to help them build their businesses and refashion the economics of their communities.  As many companies benefit from the digital acceleration, I am excited that GoDaddy has continued to gain share. I want to start today by acknowledging GoDaddy team members. The level of activity in our business and our operations are at their highest, unmatched by the personal challenges all of us face in the current environment.  In June, we announced a restructuring of our outbound sales team. And while it is always difficult to part ways with team members, we are grateful for their contribution over the years. Our team members are working hard and have adapted quickly to address the rapidly changing landscape.  The strong financial results for Q2 speak for themselves. We are pleased with the results and more importantly, with our position to grow with our customers well into the future. We are seeing strength across many parts of our business, and I want to highlight 3 items in particular. First, GoDaddy surpassed the significant milestone of 20 million paying customers. In Q2, we added more than 400,000 customers, delivering the strongest quarter of net customer growth in our 20-year history, aside from when we acquired HEG. This was driven by favorable trends, including stable retention rates and record gross customer adds in the quarter. Both of these trends were impacted positively by the strong market demand coupled with investments in marketing. We will continue to invest in marketing for as long as the returns stay within our threshold.  Second, we continue to create demonstratable value for existing and new customers by adding features and functionality to our products, such as marketing tools, video streaming, security options and bulk purchase experiences. We also made it easier for our customers to use and experiment with our products. We added a freemium experience for Websites + Marketing in Q1. And in Q2, we added Sellbrite e-commerce offering to the freemium lineup.  Third, we took a set of decisive actions from a position of strength to further optimize our business for long-term growth and cash flow generation. As mentioned, in June, we restructured our U.S. outbound sales team as its sales motion had become unsustainable due to COVID-19. And today, we fully settled the TRA at an attractive return profile while preserving both our liquidity and our ability to further invest going forward.  Lastly, we are happy to announce that we have closed on the acquisition of Neustar's registry business, and we look forward to unlocking value through vertical integration in the domain space. Ray will provide more details on these topics in his remarks.  Let's dig into customer growth and creating value for customers. Wow, second quarter of 2020, net new customers growing over 200% year-over-year getting us to 20 million paying customers. Lots of fantastic 2s and 0s in that sentence. It demonstrates just how much GoDaddy has grown since becoming a public company 5 years ago. In fact, in those short 5 years, we added nearly 7 million customers. GoDaddy continues to attract new customers to the ecosystem at a rapid pace, and those customers are seeing real value. Our retention rates are consistently high and continually stable, an ongoing testament to both the value and the criticality of our products and services to the small businesses we serve.  We continue to be the global leader in the green phase where customers name their ideas. In recent months, we brought together the greatest strength and capabilities of GoDaddy and the Uniregistry business, forming the GoDaddy Corporate Domains team. We added best-in-class new functionality for bulk purchasers, and our sales teams signed their first deals together. We also continue to see strength in primary domain sales, domain add-on and aftermarket transactions. How a business shows up online matters more now than ever before. And this is one of the reasons you continue to see our Domains segment growing more than double the industry growth.  While we love our outsized growth in the green phase with its $5 billion TAM, we are most excited about how Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress allow us to pursue the $175 billion TAM within the create and grow phases where everyday entrepreneurs build their ventures. Our customers want to do more with us. And we continue to invest in features and functionality that will let them accomplish this, especially in marketing and commerce.  In Q2, annualized recurring revenue in Websites + Marketing grew approximately 60% year-over-year. The common tier of our Websites + Marketing product accelerated even more quickly over the last few months, with net adds for our commerce tier growing 60% quarter-over-quarter and almost 90% year-over-year. In fact, 25% of new Websites + Marketing subscribers are opting for the commerce tier at nearly double the historical adoption rate, making it a bigger part of our [indiscernible]. With our commerce tier of Websites + Marketing for $25 per month, everyday entrepreneurs get a strong set of simple, easy-to-use tools to build their ventures online. Bundled with that is search engine optimization, best-in-class platform integrations with unlimited posting and tools for selling, including fee listings on Google, enhanced local delivery options and 1 year of branded e-mail. All of that backed with our award-winning guidance delivered 24/7 by our Care Guides worth hundreds of dollars all included.  For our customers, beautiful, engaging content is at the heart of their marketing. The GoDaddy offering with Over lets them do just that. In June alone, more than 14 million pieces of content were created and exported. That doubled year-over-year. The pace of user growth also accelerated. That doubled quarter-over-quarter with more than 1.7 million users engaging with Over every month. We are very excited to get the full functionality embedded in Websites + Marketing.  GoDaddy is the only company whose strength in create and grow transcends both captive CMS and WordPress. As a global champion for WordPress and the largest WordPress host, we are excited to bring new capabilities to the WordPress ecosystem. Already, our efforts in improving ease-of-use for WordPress are showing strong results. There are nearly 8,000 themes available in WordPress, and our Go Theme has quickly risen into the top 8. We are proud to be part of the open source WordPress community and the continued growth we see in Managed WordPress is great encouragement for us to continue to invest in the product.  We also saw Business Applications growth reaccelerate to 18% year-over-year, and that goes back to the frequently changing circumstances in which our customers find themselves today. Many of our customers relied on in-person interactions or inbound phone calls to brick-and-mortar stores as the means for their customers to engage with them. With many of those storefronts closed, customers have been adopting branded e-mail as an additional means to communicate with their customers. This is yet another way GoDaddy can help everyday entrepreneurs thrive while driving growth in our business as well.  Our focus on adding customer value in a strong demand environment powered a strong second quarter and sets us up well for the rest of the year. We are poised for sustainable, profitable growth for the long term and continue to be confident in our ability to hit our 4-1-1 goal, $4 billion in revenue, $1.1 billion in unlevered free cash flow organically in 2022.  With that, here's Ray. Thank you, Ray. It has been 1 year since my first GoDaddy earnings call. In that year, I have talked to many everyday entrepreneurs and fallen in love with their story. I have seen an employee base that deeply cares about the mission of the company and has risen to unprecedented challenges. While there is still uncertainty ahead and no one has a crystal ball, I am inspired by the opportunity in front of us, and our path forward is clear. Our focus on customer success drives our continued development of world-class products. That, in turn, empowers everyday entrepreneurs to sell and thrive online.  We have an incredible brand that is only getting stronger. We have a resilient, recurring business model, and we will continue to be prudent stewards of the significant cash that GoDaddy generates, pursuing growth organically and inorganically for years to come.  GoDaddy is an amazing success story. We have a TAM of $180 billion and 20 million paying customers. And I feel like we're just getting started.  Operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thanks, Deepak. This is Aman. I can take the first part, and Ray can probably take the second. We're seeing customer growth across all the product categories. We saw growth in Domains. We -- as you see, we saw growth in the biz apps and Websites + Marketing, and Managed WordPress continue to grow at a healthy rate, right? So it's not really about one product or the other. We're seeing growth across all products, and it's a function of the demand environment and the marketing spend and the value that our products bring to our customers on sort of everyday basis. We're excited about the acceleration. And the quarter continue to improve for us, and we're excited about that. Ray, do you want to take the question? Yes. Thanks, Matt. The freemium offering is a quarter in, and we continue to be excited about how it's performing, both in terms of attracting registered users to come in and try the product and the conversion rates we're seeing. And so it's meeting our expectations, and we continue to drive improvements in it.  In terms of freemium as a model, we really feel that our customers more and more people need to be able to use our products. So the freemium model allows us to do that in a successful way. And one of the things you saw this quarter is that we added the freemium offering for Sellbrite, which is a product that allows micro small businesses to connect to many of the large platforms out there and get their products out there. So it's really a model that we're using for more and more products.  And one last thing to keep in mind is that when we talk about the 20 million customers, we're talking about paying customers. That does not include freemium customers in that number. Yes. I think it's a bit too early to be able to sort of set the quarterly cohorts up. We're still, like I said, only a quarter in. But over the next few quarters, we'll definitely have a clearer idea of how those cohorts perform. Early indications, they continue to meet our expectations. So we're excited to continue to move forward on it. Yes. I do think that COVID-19 has pushed a number of people past the point of inertia where they were not adopting digital. Another way to say that is pull forward the TAM. So because people have no choice but to go digital to support their businesses, we're seeing people experimenting with ideas. We're seeing people come online, even though they had hesitated to do it in the past. When you look at that TAM of $180 billion, and it's just huge. This is a space with so many players there. And when I look at GoDaddy, I think we're really positioned well.  And when I talked in the script about I feel like we're on the start line, I look back at GoDaddy and see a leader in the dream phase, doing so well in the create phase over the last 2, 3 years. And now as we put more and more attention into the growth phase, customers want to do marketing tools with us, they want to do commerce with us, and we have good offerings for them. So the more we get our name out there related to those offerings, the more we improve those offerings, I expect GoDaddy to play a very significant role in that moving forward. Yes. As you know, we've been quite active in the acquisition space over the last few months, just talking about closing Neustar today and super excited about that. Our pipeline continues to be healthy. And of course, valuations are what they are. But we continue to look for opportunities, which can add value to our customers and become part of the GoDaddy ecosystem.  And broadly speaking, we are looking for opportunities where customers get nonlinear value, and our brand extends to be able to offer that value to customers. That's kind of the lens we're looking things at. And there's a healthy pipeline.  In terms of customer acquisition, our customer acquisition costs actually went down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And part of that is the CPMs, but a big part of that is just demand and intent from customers.  So as we look forward, our commitment is that we'll continue to invest in marketing, looking at this demand, taking share within this demand as long as it meets our thresholds. Yes. On the business apps, the focus for the teams there is to continually improve, not just sort of awareness of that product when people come to our site or through our marketing channels, but really, really reduce the friction in terms of activation, the friction in terms of fulfillment. So that adds a customer step into that product. They're able to really get value very, very quickly. And some of those efforts that we've been making over the last few quarters has started to show value.  Now clearly, part of the reacceleration here is the overall environment where customers are looking for avenues to contact their customers, and we've been telling them for years that if you use branded e-mail, you have many multiples more likely to get the attention of your customers than a regular e-mail address. And in a time like COVID, where our micro businesses, small businesses are looking to reach their customers, they're sort of thinking about all the things that we've been telling them. And we think we see that acceleration coming in Business Apps through that. And I'll turn it to Ray for sort of July and so on. Yes. I think we're just coming upon closing it, we -- just a couple of days in. So it's a bit too early to be talking about the medium-term return on Neustar. Suffice to say, we're super excited about being able to vertically integrate within the Domains space. It opens a lot of opportunity for us to create new offerings for customers to experiment at a pace and scale that we don't think the registry business has seen for many years. So that's the opportunity we're going after. And we'll be able to talk about it a lot more over the next quarter or so. Yes. If I got sort of three parts to that question: first, around net customer growth; the second around revenue breakdown subscribers versus ARPU; and third around outbound sales. Maybe I'll get started and Andrew and Ray can jump in.  On the net customer growth, obviously, we're super excited about the 400,000 number. It's massive. It's our best quarter ever if you take out the HEG acquisition. And it's really something that is a function of the demand environment we see and the work that GoDaddy has been doing. In terms of looking forward, as you know, we don't guide to net customer growth, but we do share that data with you over time, especially on a milestone basis. And given that this was such a big milestone, we felt that it would help sort of you see the things happening in the business.  In terms of the breakdown of subscribers versus ARPU, I think we continue to see that healthy mix. Obviously, the subscriber growth is very large. But we continue to see that, I would say, stable ARPU growth that this business has demonstrated for many years. So that's -- together, that's been really good.  In terms of the outbound sales motion, as we discussed, our outbound sales is a very particular motion. It was honed over the years. And COVID-19 did impact it significantly. But I'll turn it over to Andrew to share a bit more detail on it. When we think about Websites + Marketing and the opportunities, they're squarely in what we talked about, the grow phase for our customers. And 2 areas that we're investing in are marketing and commerce. To give you a bit flavor, marketing includes content. Marketing includes messaging, right? And when we did the Over acquisition, and we're bringing it into Websites + Marketing very, very quickly. So all of the great feature functionality engagement that Over has, all Websites + Marketing customers are going to have that this year very, very quickly.  Those marketing capabilities are really core to our micro businesses reaching their customers. And similarly, as we all know, commerce is a big part of it as well. And we have a great base offering in commerce. And the more our customers use us, the more we're adding features and functionality for them in the commerce space as well.  In terms of AWS, we've had some good milestones in terms of progress in our relationship there. But overall, it continues to be relatively small. We think it's a great sort of example of what GoDaddy can do for a big partner. But in the revenues -- in the total size of our revenues, it's a small item. Yes, Naved, thanks for your question. On the aftermarket, like we said, we're seeing great traction in primary, secondary Domains sales. Overall, that business or that segment growing at 10% for us, as you know, growing much faster than double of the industry. So we're super happy with that. We did -- we had, in April, talked about some weakness in there. And there are pockets of different experiences by different countries that we're seeing. But overall, very happy with the results in that segment overall.  And in terms of freemium and Websites + Marketing, the 60% ARR number just says it all, right? We continue to see healthy growth in that business on a unit basis, on a revenue basis. Super excited about what it means for the future. And it's massive LTV, right? The Website + Marketing customer drives somewhere in the order of 10 to 25x the LTV than a Domains customer for us. So being in that space, being a big player in that space and gaining share in that space has been really good for us. Thank you, and thank you all for joining on the call today. A big thanks to all GoDaddy team members all over the world for a great quarter, and look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "content": "Matt, it's Andrew. I'll just tack on one other thing. Ray mentioned we're leaning into marketing. And obviously, we've got the convictions to lean into marketing based on what we're seeing in their early. So... Yes. Our outbound sales team was a small portion of our overall care operations. We got a history, as you all know, of uniquely selling, whether in an inbound motion or in an outbound motion. That outbound motion was a discretionary one, right? The inbound one, we take a customer's call. We have an obligation to answer the phone when they call us. On the outbound side, that's a discretionary thing. And as we looked at the productivity challenges that we were facing and what we expected ahead, it made sense for us to stop that motion and reallocate that investment, as Ray mentioned, into other marketing activities. As we -- and that outbound team, yes, they focused on social, but they focused on a range of other higher-end products and services.  On the other side, with respect to productivity, we obviously took a hit there. As we've shared with you in the past, we've seen steady and continuous progress around improving it. We've embedded the level of productivity we expect to see into the guide that Ray mentioned. And importantly, we have seen consumer behavior change as we've gone through COVID in terms of how they choose to engage with care. Increasingly, it's around asynchronous chat, other digital channels, some of which we talked about in our Investor Day, but we're really seeing those different modes of engagement come to the fore in this current environment."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the GoDaddy First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Grant: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Godaddy's first quarter 2020. With me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Aman and Ray will share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, un-levered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents maybe found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results; new product introductions and innovations; our ability to integrate recent acquisitions and proposed acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our recent acquisition of Over, our recent acquisition Uniregistry's domain registrar and marketplace businesses and the expected acquisition of Neustar's registry business and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, customers and employees. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 6, 2020, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events unless required by law.  With that, here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you for joining us today and thanks again to those who joined us for our Investor Day in April. While it has only been one month since we spoke to you, we have several important updates to share today. Plus, in Q1, we delivered strong financial results which included the early impact of COVID-19 as expected changes in consumer behavior rippled across the globe along the COVID-19 arc, with the last two weeks in March being the toughest in the U.S. as everyone focused on safety first. Second, there are definitive proof points that we are creating significant value for our customers. We are seeing an uptick in customer demand as new customers are exploring how to build the website and everyday entrepreneurs in fashion, beauty, health, professional services and many other verticals are forging ahead with new ideas. Those with the website are expanding the online scope of existing ventures, adding commerce and payment features, creating digital content and downloads, adding virtual classes, appointment scheduling and much more. Third, I'm excited to share more on OpenWeStand. What started as an idea about a month ago has become a movement with over 50 partners and over 50 million views on YouTube. It is a testament of the extraordinary power of our community and the distinctive powerful and differentiated reach of our brand. The true heroes in this movement are the everyday entrepreneurs who are finding a virtual way to be open even when their physical doors are closed, making OpenWeStand a reality. And fourth, as we look into Q2, our core business continues to be resilient, with renewal rates edging up year-over-year. Predicting the balance of the pressure on small and medium sized businesses on one hand and human creativity driving new digital demand on the other is pretty hard. For example, in Germany and Italy, where the pandemic seems to have been restrained, we have seen growth customer adds accelerate to 80% year-over-year growth, albeit of a relatively smaller base. Additionally, while we have some headwind in care and services and through disciplined execution we have improved them on a weekly basis for some teams being back in the office environment remains a key part of getting back to peak performance. In his comments Ray will go through what all of this means for Q2 guidance. Let's dig into creating value for everyday entrepreneurs. GoDaddy is a customer-led software company, built on the foundational idea that creating value for our customers is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Helping our customers on the journey from green to create and grow remains a key driver of engagement and TAM expansion. As customer needs shifted over the past few weeks, accelerating our pace of experimentation and innovation enabled us to quickly bring offers to support them. Over the last four weeks, we have started an experiment with a freemium model for websites plus marketing. This is now available to all customers in the U.S. and include product integration with GoFundMe, robust gift card functionality, expanded capabilities with PayPal and much more. In the true spirit of experimentation being customer-led, we also launched a basic messaging capability so our customers are able to connect with their customers. Getting these features out quickly allows us to give early customer feedback and improve them rapidly. For example, you will see us upgrade the messaging capability within days, and that is just one of the two ecosystems we are part of. We also have a new offer available to designers and developers, bringing together manage WordPress and WooCommerce at an attractive limited time price point of $1 for three months, everything they need to get their customers selling online fast. In fact, it's not just websites plus marketing or manage WordPress that we're moving on quickly to improve all our products and engineering teams have reset their roadmaps on the WIN model, meaning what's important now. We have active offers for three-month free trial of our digital marketing suite and overthrow and 30-day free trials of celebrates multiplatform e-commerce marketplace solution. And the results install of the over app jumped 24% month-over-month in March and Sellbrite saw a 20% month-over-month increase in connections to online marketplaces. The opportunity to introduce our products to customers when they need them most in a manner that is easy for them create immediate customer value and will lead to shareholder value over time. And we want to extend our ability to experiment to innovate and give customers more choices at competitive price points. One of the key tools in our toolbox is the ability to deploy capital, and in early April, we announced the acquisition of the registry business from Neustar, which will be known as GoDaddy Registry. While the acquisition will have only a small financial impact this year, we believe there is significant strategic importance here. We have demonstrated in our roughly 20 years as a registrar that we can innovate and dramatically increase the value we offer to customers. We plan to bring the same innovative rigor to the registry business. Vertical integration reduces the many complexities of building innovative end-to-end offerings for customers at competitive price points. We have experience creating value for everyone in the industry. Just look at the domain aftermarket. Over the nearly seven years since Afternic became part of GoDaddy, almost every major registrar leverages our Afternic platform for aftermarket domain sales, creating greater choice and value for customers and creating greater value for our partners. We look forward to closing the acquisition in the coming months, and welcoming the team to the GoDaddy family. Equally important is the guidance we provide to our customers which has been part of our ethos at GoDaddy since the beginning. It is our killer app. It is a competitive advantage. In these unprecedented times, entrepreneurs need guidance and we are committed to being there for them.  When we took 7,500 Guides home several weeks ago, we focused first on their safety and then moved quickly and creatively to guide customers effectively. And I am happy to share that our average speed answer has been exceptional. Customers are surprised and delighted that we would call them just to offer help, and they have shared positive recognition for our guide across many calls. Anecdotally, I have received a greater number of messages directly from customers, thanking us for being there to help them in this difficult period. This is why we exist. This is what our brand is about. The GoDaddy brand is a remarkable asset, and there has never been a better expression of it than OpenWeStand. Let me take a moment to share its origin. About a month ago, we saw a gap in the way small businesses could find and take advantage of the many offers available to them. The offers were not in a central location that made it easy for entrepreneurs to find them. OpenWeStand solve both these problems and has grown beyond our wildest expectations, in an amazing display of the exponential power of our community what I thought would be 2020 hindsight has become 50/50. I thought 20 partners and 20 million views would have been an amazing achievement. But here we are more than 50 partners and over 50 million views on YouTube and thousands of activations by small business owners. That is a movement and the momentum continues. The movement started with a 60-second film to communicate our desire to help businesses stay open, even when their doors are closed. We invest in media to communicate this message and directed all traffic to OpenWeStand.org. This site now stands as a repository for us and our partners to provide offers, help and advice, where partners can edit their own content and small business owners can find the help they need. As traffic to the site continues to grow, we are posting more offers and content, as well as enhancing filtering capabilities making it easier to navigate. The need for these resources is great. As an example we did our first webinar last week with expectations of 300 attendees. It tremendously exceeded our expectations with 5,000 sign-up and over 1,000 attendees. It has been humbling and inspiring to see the response from the community, and we will continue to put muscle and marketing dollars behind OpenWeStand, providing valuable offers to our community in a central location. Before I wrap up, I want to tell you about Liv, one of our remarkable everyday entrepreneurs. She started Box and Flow in New York of boxing and yoga studio. If you talk to her, she will tell you that she really believes in this idea of balance and combining strength and softness as a way of life. When the pandemic hit, she left her studio in New York and temporarily moved to Florida to be near family. But the entrepreneurial spirit in her didn't stop. She was comfortable taking risks, though she continued to try and experiment. She started teaching classes on Instagram and last week offered all her classes online. She is not only teaching her regulars in New York, she now has regulars from Malaysia to Barcelona. Liv is not just trying to survive. She figured out how to make her dream bigger, and she demonstrates the spirit and drive we are here to serve. And in these times where so many parts of our lives have transitioned to a digital experience, we are seeing the best of human creativity. We believe human creativity will drive many variations of online businesses, and we are fortunate to be a global leader serving this massive market of everyday entrepreneurs like Liv. In the current COVID driven climate, GoDaddy's distinctive financial profile with profitable growth at scale stands out. We have the capability to invest capital aggressively and an experienced management team that can make sure we do that with prudence and as good stewards of both the P&L and the balance sheet. We know that short-term everyday entrepreneurs like Liv may have some setbacks, but we know that their beliefs and spirit will not be deterred. I believe in Liv and millions of other everyday entrepreneurs just like her keeps us confident that we will deliver on our 411 target, $4 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion un-levered free cash flow organically by 2020.  With that, here is Ray.\nRay Winborne: Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for the quarter and the outlook for Q2, along with some additional commentary on the impacts of COVID-19 to our business, and finally, the contribution we expect from Neustar's registry. Q1 reflected good top line performance and strong operating leverage in the business. Despite some softness in the last few weeks of the quarter, initial impacts of shelter-in-place began to materialize. Revenue came in at $792 million, growing over 12% on a constant currency basis, with 80 basis points of currency.  Looking at product categories, we delivered double-digit growth in domains on higher average selling price. Growth in hosting and presence accelerated, higher subscriptions to Websites + Marketing and our managed WordPress offering. And while business applications grew 14% year-over-year, growth rate was reduced by roughly 4% point due to the cancellation of CloudFest, our annual hosting industry conference response to COVID-19. By geography the U.S. grew 14% versus last year. Our international revenue was $260 million in Q1, growing 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The international revenue growth rate was reduced by approximately two percentage points due to the cancellation of CloudFest.  Total bookings grew to $951 million, rising 10% on a constant currency basis with an estimated two points of pressure from the effects of COVID-19, roughly a point of currency headwind. The US dollar has continued to strengthen against the basket of currencies we collect, and we expect currency to remain a headwind in Q2. Gross margin was 65% in the quarter in line with the trailing 12-month average. We delivered solid operating leverage this quarter, particularly in the care and G&A line items, as we continue to scale the business. This resulted in normalized EBITDA of $164 million in Q1, a three points of margin expansion last year. Moving to cash flow. Un-levered free cash flow for the quarter was $235 million, growing 18% year-over-year. This quarter benefited from the timing of CapEx payment. We expect to balance out in the first half of 2020. Trailing 12-month un-levered free cash flow was over three quarters of a billion dollars and margin top 25%, illustrating the size and scale of this business. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $851 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.5 billion. Net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about two-times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. This affords us both a margin of safety in uncertain times, but also the opportunity to invest both organically and inorganically. Since our last earnings call, we deployed over $0.5 billion in capital, repurchasing 10 million shares of our common stock an average price of just over $54 per share. Very attractive valuation from a forward free cash flow year. This repurchase represents nearly 6% of our fully diluted shares outstanding. We also announced the acquisition of Neustar's registry business, with the purchase price of $218 million, with closing expected in the coming months. We will fund the acquisition from cash on the balance sheet. And based on the information obtained in diligence, we estimate the 2020 financial contribution will be less than a point to revenue growth and less than $10 million to un-levered free cash flow. Stepping back, GoDaddy has a recurring revenue business model, is highly cash generative as well capitalized with a strong liquidity position, providing the ability to both weather storms and take advantage of opportunity. Against this backdrop, you'll continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital, with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth un-levered free cash flow for [technical difficulty]. With that, let's turn to the outlook for Q2. Including the estimated $25 million to $30 million impact of COVID-19 that we outlined at Investor Day, we expect total revenue of approximately $790 million or 7% year-over-year growth. We expect total bookings growth to be roughly in line with revenue growth for the quarter. We will continue to provide quarterly updates to guidance as we navigate our way through the current environment. To reiterate what we called out last month, these are unprecedented time, but the degree of uncertainty facing our customers, peers and communities in general, we want to make sure we continue to provide the pattern of transparency we've established. We don't have a crystal ball and while we're seeing resiliency in subscription renewals and strength in new online sales, we have experienced some headwinds in two areas of the business. First, and certain of our higher price do-it-for-you services aftermarket, seeing the natural effect of price consciousness the businesses exhibit in uncertain times. And second, work from home has had a predictable impact on new sales predicted of our Care Guides. While it's improving, we expect that to impact to continue to some degree until we get folks back in the office, whenever it's safe and prudent. As promised, we'll provide a bit more granularity around our quarterly revenue guidance going forward. Q2, we would expect high single digit growth in domains, mid single digit growth in hosting and presence and mid-teens growth in business application. Do-it-for-you services like social reputation management and professional website build disproportionately impact the hosting and presence line. Finally, while COVID-19 has created a significant upheaval in the global economy and job markets, it has led to an uptick in interest to start new venture. You should expect us to lean in on marketing spend, attractive customer offers drive share that increased demand. In closing, we have a distinctive value proposition that combines our brand, seamlessly intuitive experiences, power of community and sage guidance, uniquely serve our customers, help them continue their business while minimizing complaints, huge opportunity in serving the needs of the everyday entrepreneur. And we're proud to deliver on the promise of partnership that our customers in these challenging times. With that operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yigal Iranian from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nYigal Iranian: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Two, if I could. So, let's see here a little bit more about the Neustar Registry acquisition, the strategic importance of that, how verticalization helps that segment over time, especially given that there's some sensitivities around favoring GoDaddy products. So, that's the first one. And then maybe if you could give both on the revenue impacts from the free trials and the freemium website offer that you're giving customers, if you could help quantify the impact there? And then also if you could help quantify the impact of bringing new customers onboard and keeping the retention rate up, how those free trials are impacting growth. Thanks. \nAman Bhutani: Hey, Yigal. It\u2019s Aman. Thank you for your question. Unfortunately, the tech issue and we didn't catch the first part of your question, only the second part. Would you mind just repeating the question for us.\nYigal Iranian: Sure. So, the first part was just on the Neustar Registry acquisition. If you could help, maybe give a little bit more color around the strategic importance of it. Why verticalization is important. How that could help the domain business grow over time, especially given that there's some sensitivities around not favoring GoDaddy products when you're in the funnel for that. That was the first question..\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Thank you. Let me take the first piece of that and Andrew can talk to the governance pieces and sort of creating opportunity across the industry. If we take a step back and look at the dream phase for the customer, we've continued to be a leader in that space, with our domains product and we've been in many parts of the domain business. We mentioned the aftermarket as an example of something recent that we did that went across the industry. But if you look at the registry business, that's the business we have not been in the past. And if you think about creating just new different kinds of offering -- this very innovative different ways to think about domains as competitive price points to go across organizations involves a certain level of risk and just challenges to coordinate all of that. With vertical integration, we can experiment at a much faster pace. We can sort of wave all of those things and say we want to test this, let's get this in front of customers and let's see how it works. And while we do that, we can do it in a manner where it's open to the whole industry where the line of governance is clear. And just like the aftermarket value is created not just for the customer, but for everyone in the industry that participates as well. And Andrew, do you want to add a bit to it. \nAndrew Low Ah Kee: I think to Aman's point this idea that we innovate and we bring value across the entire industry is something we've got a track record with today in our aftermarket business on our Afternic platform. We actually partner with virtually every major registrar in the industry and that's created a ton of value for all of the participants, and we look forward to doing the same with our registry business. We do have a clear governance model in place that create separation between these businesses to address concerns folks might have, and we're confident in our ability to implement that. There are a number of vertically integrated registrar registries in the industry today. They're able to stand by that commitment to offer equal access to everyone and we feel very comfortable with our ability to do it as well.\nAman Bhutani: And then on the question on premium, it's pretty recent. We moved quickly to put it out there. It started as an experiment. We did roll it out to all customers in the U.S., but it's still very, very early and we designed it as an experiment. So, we're tracking a lot of data around it. And over the next few months, we'll be able to tell you a lot more about it. But it's still pretty early, yeah.\nYigal Iranian: Thank you. Thanks so much\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Thomas on for Deepak. With the free cash flow guidance withdrawn, can you help us with how we should think about the underlying variables here? Are there any changes in the contract term or product mix during this time that we -- that might weigh on free cash flow? Thank you.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, Thomas. Hey, it's Ray. The bookings growth, I think, is where you should look. I mentioned in my prepared comments that we expected to grow roughly in line with revenue. Bookings translates to cash. And then the other thing that I pointed out is that we had timing impacts of capital payments from Q1 to Q2, so be looking at. But stepping back more broadly when you look at what's going on, Aman has talked about before, we're looking at the financial certainty for our employees, we're putting out attractive offers for our customers. So, those are going to pressure cash flow, but obviously there are a lot of discretionary expenses that we're managing very tightly to mitigate the impact of that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thanks much. Just curious on the customer acquisition front, you are thinking about LTV here and going. I guess, pressing the pedal down a bit as you mentioned. Just curious how you think about returns longer term, I assume most of who you're acquiring today are either out of work or potentially furloughed for a period of time. So, I'm just curious how you're considering that and when you look at potentially converging here down the road. Thanks.\nAndrew Low Ah Kee: Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Andrew Low Ah Kee here. I'm happy to talk to that one. We're definitely seeing an increase digitization of small business, the everyday entrepreneurs who maybe weren't online, didn't have a presence or even had one and needed to get it refreshed in an environment where everyone is finding and discovering things online is absolutely a tailwind for the sector at large. And so we are leaning in with our marketing spend. Aman in his prepared remarks referenced OpenWeStand. That's an important thing for our customers. It's an important thing for our brand. And equally, it has the same return profile that we typically would be looking at. In fact, when we look at our April cohort, our April cohort is the strongest we've ever had for in April. And so, we're absolutely seeing that demand come to bear in the marketplace.\nMark Zgutowicz: Okay. Thanks much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open thanks.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. On business apps, it was a little light of where the Street was modeling and some of the explainable late in the quarter. But I'm just curious if you saw that rebounding in April and into May, that the move to doing more with you than just buying one piece of the solution?\nRay Winborne: Hey, Brent. It\u2019s Ray. There was one item that really drove a lot of that desale that you saw in the biz apps line and that's our CloudFest event. It's an annual event for the hosting industry and that created four point headwind on the growth rate there. Beyond that biz apps actually landed exactly where we had guided to earlier and right within our expectations.\nBrent Thill: And Ray, any color April through May listen to a number of these earnings calls you saw stabilization and improvement, are you seeing that follow-through through April into May.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, I think, Aman highlighted a lot of what we're seeing in his prepared comments. We are seeing green shoots. I mean, if you look at -- renewal rates are absolutely holding steady. We're seeing good growth in new online sales. It's the couple of areas we pointed out before at the Investor Day where we're still seeing challenges and watching. One was around our Care Guides being at home and productivity sales hit. And then our higher price point products, which are generally the do-it-for-you products.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry I'm going to ask a question, I may have missed some of the first part of the call. One of those issues that you just mentioned, Ray, that Care Guides efficiency. Did you -- did you already say whether you've seen some recovery in that? I understand the efficiencies that it's created from kind of taking people away from the -- whatever the synergies of a centralized place. Is it clear to you that there's a path back, or is that just going to be the case until people are able to get back in work in their shared centers.\nRay Winborne: Yeah. Hey, Mark. Thanks for the question. And obviously, when we first went home, that was the greatest impact. While they were adjusting to the new environment, we really did see a pretty significant drop. We've been seeing continual improvement since then in the productivity, but there is a gap, right? These guys have been working out of offices in high energy sales environments for most of their careers and we're not going to get to that level of productivity, be working from home with those groups. So, I think, as far as where we are today and early May, we've seen a pretty significant improvement in the productivity of those Guides. Probably seeing what we're going to see until we're going to back in the office at this point.\nMark Mahaney: Could you just remind us please where are those basic customer care centers, where are they located geographically? And in those areas what are the -- what's there -- what's the visibility and to when offices will be reopened?\nRay Winborne: We're watching the local regulations and health announcements around the world. The vast majority of our Guides or a large majority of our Guides are based in Arizona and Iowa. But beyond that India is probably the next biggest that we've got. So we're watching each one of those locations will be treated differently based on the local conditions.\nAman Bhutani: And Mark, this is Aman. We're actually in touch with local offices on a daily basis to see how the situation is developing for that city for the area around our office. And we're listening to politicians, we're listening to scientists. We also have our own criteria of one when we can take people back and we'll take a prudent approach to that. And we'll put some people in and experiment and have the proper office distancing and sort of make our way back as things improve.\nMark Mahaney: And I'm sorry if I could throw in one other question. Andrew, you'd mentioned something about the big -- the April being a very strong month in terms of new customer acquisitions. I think, this is one of those hard questions to answer, because there's so early on. But can you tell whether that cohort -- April cohort, I know it's very early -- very recent. Is acting any different than cohorts you brought in, in the past. More engaged less engaged, any way to tell?\nAndrew Low Ah Kee: It's early to be talking about that. The reality is we're seeing very strong demand for our presence products. We shared with folks obviously the strength that we're seeing in the create space whether Websites + Marketing or WordPress with you all at Investor Day and those are areas we're seeing continued goodness in, in April, but it's early.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNate Mitchell: Thanks. This is that Nate Mitchell on for Naved. Aman, thank you for the color on Germany. One, I was wondering if you could maybe speak to the growth in customer adds across geos in April. And then two, wondering if you can help us -- how to think about -- how big of an on-ramp the freemium offering and Website + Marketing can be for you guys. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, thank you Nate for the question. We wanted to give you a little bit of color, so we took two markets in Italy and Germany and it's obviously hard for us to comment on each market and growth rates there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there's an arc of COVID-19 and how it sort of progressed across the world where you saw every market sort of going to some level of lockdown and then sort of open up a little bit. And what we saw with that when there was unknown, right, people seem to clamp down and really worry about a lot of things and focus on safety. And in the U.S. that period seemed to be the last two weeks of March more so than other periods. But that same arc has sort of pretty much repeated itself across the world. And in terms of the on-ramp for freemium, it's just too early to be talking about it. We're super excited to have freemium there. We're super excited that we were able to bring it forward at a time when our customers needed most. But it's just too early to talk about -- just yet.\nNate Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Just wanted to ask about M&A and wondering if you're seeing anything in the current environment, maybe that starts to look more interesting, particularly given the use of leverage in the space privately. And then, I guess, related to that, is the current environment change at all? How you guys think about leverage and what you'd be willing or possible to take on as part of any M&A. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Now let me take \u2026\nRay Winborne: Hey, Lloyd. It\u2019s Ray. I'll start and Aman can come over to talk. You look at our leverage today, we've got a target range of two to four times. We're right at the bottom of that range today, so feel comfortable. Obviously, given the uncertainty of COVID and how long it's going to go on, what the depth is going to be, we're obviously focused on liquidity like others. And we'll provide any specific comments around the pipeline on M&A right now.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, I think, Ray covered. You've seen us have been quite active over the last few months. And we have a pipeline, as we've said previously and we don't comment on any specific company which may or may not be part of our pipeline.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead your line is open.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thanks. I just had a follow-up on the Guides productivity question. I guess, the flip side of that question, when they are back in office, what do you expect to see in terms of lift and where would we see that? And then separate question on WooCommerce. Just curious what your long-term -- your near-term, long-term objectives are there. And so what we should expect for future, I guess, discussion on progress there. Thanks.\nAndrew Low Ah Kee: Sure. As both come back in the office, it's going to be a ramp as we get people back into the game. It is not like overnight. We're going to flip a switch and 7,300 Guides are going to be sitting back in the office. So, it's going to be a slow and long ramp as we get folks back into the office. And then in terms of how they perform, we think there will be an improvement. Again, as Ray mentioned, folks have built up a system over many years that that drive sales engagement. That said, I think, the unknown will be customer demand on the other side, and how customers behave particularly for those higher priced offers. That's a question, Mark, that we yet to see.\nAman Bhutani: And then maybe just touch on the WooCommerce point. We have a great position in the WordPress ecosystem, the WooCommerce product. And we have a tremendous partnership with automatic as well there. So, we have a great offer in the market. Now, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and our customers are loving it. So, we continue to like the offer we have there and continue to love customers coming to us with their WordPress and WooCommerce needs.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Aman Bhutani.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you. I'll just say a quick thank you to all the employees across GoDaddy globally. A tremendous amount of work has gone in over the last few weeks that have been challenging to say the least. But while all of us focused on supporting each other every person at GoDaddy has worked hard to support our customers and for that I'm truly grateful. Now, thanks for joining our call today and we'll see you next time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for the quarter and the outlook for Q2, along with some additional commentary on the impacts of COVID-19 to our business, and finally, the contribution we expect from Neustar's registry. Q1 reflected good top line performance and strong operating leverage in the business. Despite some softness in the last few weeks of the quarter, initial impacts of shelter-in-place began to materialize. Revenue came in at $792 million, growing over 12% on a constant currency basis, with 80 basis points of currency.  Looking at product categories, we delivered double-digit growth in domains on higher average selling price. Growth in hosting and presence accelerated, higher subscriptions to Websites + Marketing and our managed WordPress offering. And while business applications grew 14% year-over-year, growth rate was reduced by roughly 4% point due to the cancellation of CloudFest, our annual hosting industry conference response to COVID-19. By geography the U.S. grew 14% versus last year. Our international revenue was $260 million in Q1, growing 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The international revenue growth rate was reduced by approximately two percentage points due to the cancellation of CloudFest.  Total bookings grew to $951 million, rising 10% on a constant currency basis with an estimated two points of pressure from the effects of COVID-19, roughly a point of currency headwind. The US dollar has continued to strengthen against the basket of currencies we collect, and we expect currency to remain a headwind in Q2. Gross margin was 65% in the quarter in line with the trailing 12-month average. We delivered solid operating leverage this quarter, particularly in the care and G&A line items, as we continue to scale the business. This resulted in normalized EBITDA of $164 million in Q1, a three points of margin expansion last year. Moving to cash flow. Un-levered free cash flow for the quarter was $235 million, growing 18% year-over-year. This quarter benefited from the timing of CapEx payment. We expect to balance out in the first half of 2020. Trailing 12-month un-levered free cash flow was over three quarters of a billion dollars and margin top 25%, illustrating the size and scale of this business. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $851 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.5 billion. Net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about two-times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. This affords us both a margin of safety in uncertain times, but also the opportunity to invest both organically and inorganically. Since our last earnings call, we deployed over $0.5 billion in capital, repurchasing 10 million shares of our common stock an average price of just over $54 per share. Very attractive valuation from a forward free cash flow year. This repurchase represents nearly 6% of our fully diluted shares outstanding. We also announced the acquisition of Neustar's registry business, with the purchase price of $218 million, with closing expected in the coming months. We will fund the acquisition from cash on the balance sheet. And based on the information obtained in diligence, we estimate the 2020 financial contribution will be less than a point to revenue growth and less than $10 million to un-levered free cash flow. Stepping back, GoDaddy has a recurring revenue business model, is highly cash generative as well capitalized with a strong liquidity position, providing the ability to both weather storms and take advantage of opportunity. Against this backdrop, you'll continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital, with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth un-levered free cash flow for [technical difficulty]. With that, let's turn to the outlook for Q2. Including the estimated $25 million to $30 million impact of COVID-19 that we outlined at Investor Day, we expect total revenue of approximately $790 million or 7% year-over-year growth. We expect total bookings growth to be roughly in line with revenue growth for the quarter. We will continue to provide quarterly updates to guidance as we navigate our way through the current environment. To reiterate what we called out last month, these are unprecedented time, but the degree of uncertainty facing our customers, peers and communities in general, we want to make sure we continue to provide the pattern of transparency we've established. We don't have a crystal ball and while we're seeing resiliency in subscription renewals and strength in new online sales, we have experienced some headwinds in two areas of the business. First, and certain of our higher price do-it-for-you services aftermarket, seeing the natural effect of price consciousness the businesses exhibit in uncertain times. And second, work from home has had a predictable impact on new sales predicted of our Care Guides. While it's improving, we expect that to impact to continue to some degree until we get folks back in the office, whenever it's safe and prudent. As promised, we'll provide a bit more granularity around our quarterly revenue guidance going forward. Q2, we would expect high single digit growth in domains, mid single digit growth in hosting and presence and mid-teens growth in business application. Do-it-for-you services like social reputation management and professional website build disproportionately impact the hosting and presence line. Finally, while COVID-19 has created a significant upheaval in the global economy and job markets, it has led to an uptick in interest to start new venture. You should expect us to lean in on marketing spend, attractive customer offers drive share that increased demand. In closing, we have a distinctive value proposition that combines our brand, seamlessly intuitive experiences, power of community and sage guidance, uniquely serve our customers, help them continue their business while minimizing complaints, huge opportunity in serving the needs of the everyday entrepreneur. And we're proud to deliver on the promise of partnership that our customers in these challenging times. With that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Yeah, Thomas. Hey, it's Ray. The bookings growth, I think, is where you should look. I mentioned in my prepared comments that we expected to grow roughly in line with revenue. Bookings translates to cash. And then the other thing that I pointed out is that we had timing impacts of capital payments from Q1 to Q2, so be looking at. But stepping back more broadly when you look at what's going on, Aman has talked about before, we're looking at the financial certainty for our employees, we're putting out attractive offers for our customers. So, those are going to pressure cash flow, but obviously there are a lot of discretionary expenses that we're managing very tightly to mitigate the impact of that. Hey, Brent. It's Ray. There was one item that really drove a lot of that desale that you saw in the biz apps line and that's our CloudFest event. It's an annual event for the hosting industry and that created four point headwind on the growth rate there. Beyond that biz apps actually landed exactly where we had guided to earlier and right within our expectations. Yeah, I think, Aman highlighted a lot of what we're seeing in his prepared comments. We are seeing green shoots. I mean, if you look at -- renewal rates are absolutely holding steady. We're seeing good growth in new online sales. It's the couple of areas we pointed out before at the Investor Day where we're still seeing challenges and watching. One was around our Care Guides being at home and productivity sales hit. And then our higher price point products, which are generally the do-it-for-you products. Yeah. Hey, Mark. Thanks for the question. And obviously, when we first went home, that was the greatest impact. While they were adjusting to the new environment, we really did see a pretty significant drop. We've been seeing continual improvement since then in the productivity, but there is a gap, right? These guys have been working out of offices in high energy sales environments for most of their careers and we're not going to get to that level of productivity, be working from home with those groups. So, I think, as far as where we are today and early May, we've seen a pretty significant improvement in the productivity of those Guides. Probably seeing what we're going to see until we're going to back in the office at this point. We're watching the local regulations and health announcements around the world. The vast majority of our Guides or a large majority of our Guides are based in Arizona and Iowa. But beyond that India is probably the next biggest that we've got. So we're watching each one of those locations will be treated differently based on the local conditions. Hey, Lloyd. It's Ray. I'll start and Aman can come over to talk. You look at our leverage today, we've got a target range of two to four times. We're right at the bottom of that range today, so feel comfortable. Obviously, given the uncertainty of COVID and how long it's going to go on, what the depth is going to be, we're obviously focused on liquidity like others. And we'll provide any specific comments around the pipeline on M&A right now."

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today and thanks again to those who joined us for our Investor Day in April. While it has only been one month since we spoke to you, we have several important updates to share today. Plus, in Q1, we delivered strong financial results which included the early impact of COVID-19 as expected changes in consumer behavior rippled across the globe along the COVID-19 arc, with the last two weeks in March being the toughest in the U.S. as everyone focused on safety first. Second, there are definitive proof points that we are creating significant value for our customers. We are seeing an uptick in customer demand as new customers are exploring how to build the website and everyday entrepreneurs in fashion, beauty, health, professional services and many other verticals are forging ahead with new ideas. Those with the website are expanding the online scope of existing ventures, adding commerce and payment features, creating digital content and downloads, adding virtual classes, appointment scheduling and much more. Third, I'm excited to share more on OpenWeStand. What started as an idea about a month ago has become a movement with over 50 partners and over 50 million views on YouTube. It is a testament of the extraordinary power of our community and the distinctive powerful and differentiated reach of our brand. The true heroes in this movement are the everyday entrepreneurs who are finding a virtual way to be open even when their physical doors are closed, making OpenWeStand a reality. And fourth, as we look into Q2, our core business continues to be resilient, with renewal rates edging up year-over-year. Predicting the balance of the pressure on small and medium sized businesses on one hand and human creativity driving new digital demand on the other is pretty hard. For example, in Germany and Italy, where the pandemic seems to have been restrained, we have seen growth customer adds accelerate to 80% year-over-year growth, albeit of a relatively smaller base. Additionally, while we have some headwind in care and services and through disciplined execution we have improved them on a weekly basis for some teams being back in the office environment remains a key part of getting back to peak performance. In his comments Ray will go through what all of this means for Q2 guidance. Let's dig into creating value for everyday entrepreneurs. GoDaddy is a customer-led software company, built on the foundational idea that creating value for our customers is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Helping our customers on the journey from green to create and grow remains a key driver of engagement and TAM expansion. As customer needs shifted over the past few weeks, accelerating our pace of experimentation and innovation enabled us to quickly bring offers to support them. Over the last four weeks, we have started an experiment with a freemium model for websites plus marketing. This is now available to all customers in the U.S. and include product integration with GoFundMe, robust gift card functionality, expanded capabilities with PayPal and much more. In the true spirit of experimentation being customer-led, we also launched a basic messaging capability so our customers are able to connect with their customers. Getting these features out quickly allows us to give early customer feedback and improve them rapidly. For example, you will see us upgrade the messaging capability within days, and that is just one of the two ecosystems we are part of. We also have a new offer available to designers and developers, bringing together manage WordPress and WooCommerce at an attractive limited time price point of $1 for three months, everything they need to get their customers selling online fast. In fact, it's not just websites plus marketing or manage WordPress that we're moving on quickly to improve all our products and engineering teams have reset their roadmaps on the WIN model, meaning what's important now. We have active offers for three-month free trial of our digital marketing suite and overthrow and 30-day free trials of celebrates multiplatform e-commerce marketplace solution. And the results install of the over app jumped 24% month-over-month in March and Sellbrite saw a 20% month-over-month increase in connections to online marketplaces. The opportunity to introduce our products to customers when they need them most in a manner that is easy for them create immediate customer value and will lead to shareholder value over time. And we want to extend our ability to experiment to innovate and give customers more choices at competitive price points. One of the key tools in our toolbox is the ability to deploy capital, and in early April, we announced the acquisition of the registry business from Neustar, which will be known as GoDaddy Registry. While the acquisition will have only a small financial impact this year, we believe there is significant strategic importance here. We have demonstrated in our roughly 20 years as a registrar that we can innovate and dramatically increase the value we offer to customers. We plan to bring the same innovative rigor to the registry business. Vertical integration reduces the many complexities of building innovative end-to-end offerings for customers at competitive price points. We have experience creating value for everyone in the industry. Just look at the domain aftermarket. Over the nearly seven years since Afternic became part of GoDaddy, almost every major registrar leverages our Afternic platform for aftermarket domain sales, creating greater choice and value for customers and creating greater value for our partners. We look forward to closing the acquisition in the coming months, and welcoming the team to the GoDaddy family. Equally important is the guidance we provide to our customers which has been part of our ethos at GoDaddy since the beginning. It is our killer app. It is a competitive advantage. In these unprecedented times, entrepreneurs need guidance and we are committed to being there for them.  When we took 7,500 Guides home several weeks ago, we focused first on their safety and then moved quickly and creatively to guide customers effectively. And I am happy to share that our average speed answer has been exceptional. Customers are surprised and delighted that we would call them just to offer help, and they have shared positive recognition for our guide across many calls. Anecdotally, I have received a greater number of messages directly from customers, thanking us for being there to help them in this difficult period. This is why we exist. This is what our brand is about. The GoDaddy brand is a remarkable asset, and there has never been a better expression of it than OpenWeStand. Let me take a moment to share its origin. About a month ago, we saw a gap in the way small businesses could find and take advantage of the many offers available to them. The offers were not in a central location that made it easy for entrepreneurs to find them. OpenWeStand solve both these problems and has grown beyond our wildest expectations, in an amazing display of the exponential power of our community what I thought would be 2020 hindsight has become 50/50. I thought 20 partners and 20 million views would have been an amazing achievement. But here we are more than 50 partners and over 50 million views on YouTube and thousands of activations by small business owners. That is a movement and the momentum continues. The movement started with a 60-second film to communicate our desire to help businesses stay open, even when their doors are closed. We invest in media to communicate this message and directed all traffic to OpenWeStand.org. This site now stands as a repository for us and our partners to provide offers, help and advice, where partners can edit their own content and small business owners can find the help they need. As traffic to the site continues to grow, we are posting more offers and content, as well as enhancing filtering capabilities making it easier to navigate. The need for these resources is great. As an example we did our first webinar last week with expectations of 300 attendees. It tremendously exceeded our expectations with 5,000 sign-up and over 1,000 attendees. It has been humbling and inspiring to see the response from the community, and we will continue to put muscle and marketing dollars behind OpenWeStand, providing valuable offers to our community in a central location. Before I wrap up, I want to tell you about Liv, one of our remarkable everyday entrepreneurs. She started Box and Flow in New York of boxing and yoga studio. If you talk to her, she will tell you that she really believes in this idea of balance and combining strength and softness as a way of life. When the pandemic hit, she left her studio in New York and temporarily moved to Florida to be near family. But the entrepreneurial spirit in her didn't stop. She was comfortable taking risks, though she continued to try and experiment. She started teaching classes on Instagram and last week offered all her classes online. She is not only teaching her regulars in New York, she now has regulars from Malaysia to Barcelona. Liv is not just trying to survive. She figured out how to make her dream bigger, and she demonstrates the spirit and drive we are here to serve. And in these times where so many parts of our lives have transitioned to a digital experience, we are seeing the best of human creativity. We believe human creativity will drive many variations of online businesses, and we are fortunate to be a global leader serving this massive market of everyday entrepreneurs like Liv. In the current COVID driven climate, GoDaddy's distinctive financial profile with profitable growth at scale stands out. We have the capability to invest capital aggressively and an experienced management team that can make sure we do that with prudence and as good stewards of both the P&L and the balance sheet. We know that short-term everyday entrepreneurs like Liv may have some setbacks, but we know that their beliefs and spirit will not be deterred. I believe in Liv and millions of other everyday entrepreneurs just like her keeps us confident that we will deliver on our 411 target, $4 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion un-levered free cash flow organically by 2020.  With that, here is Ray. Hey, Yigal. It's Aman. Thank you for your question. Unfortunately, the tech issue and we didn't catch the first part of your question, only the second part. Would you mind just repeating the question for us. Yeah. Thank you. Let me take the first piece of that and Andrew can talk to the governance pieces and sort of creating opportunity across the industry. If we take a step back and look at the dream phase for the customer, we've continued to be a leader in that space, with our domains product and we've been in many parts of the domain business. We mentioned the aftermarket as an example of something recent that we did that went across the industry. But if you look at the registry business, that's the business we have not been in the past. And if you think about creating just new different kinds of offering -- this very innovative different ways to think about domains as competitive price points to go across organizations involves a certain level of risk and just challenges to coordinate all of that. With vertical integration, we can experiment at a much faster pace. We can sort of wave all of those things and say we want to test this, let's get this in front of customers and let's see how it works. And while we do that, we can do it in a manner where it's open to the whole industry where the line of governance is clear. And just like the aftermarket value is created not just for the customer, but for everyone in the industry that participates as well. And Andrew, do you want to add a bit to it. And then on the question on premium, it's pretty recent. We moved quickly to put it out there. It started as an experiment. We did roll it out to all customers in the U.S., but it's still very, very early and we designed it as an experiment. So, we're tracking a lot of data around it. And over the next few months, we'll be able to tell you a lot more about it. But it's still pretty early, yeah. Thank you. And Mark, this is Aman. We're actually in touch with local offices on a daily basis to see how the situation is developing for that city for the area around our office. And we're listening to politicians, we're listening to scientists. We also have our own criteria of one when we can take people back and we'll take a prudent approach to that. And we'll put some people in and experiment and have the proper office distancing and sort of make our way back as things improve. Yeah, thank you Nate for the question. We wanted to give you a little bit of color, so we took two markets in Italy and Germany and it's obviously hard for us to comment on each market and growth rates there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there's an arc of COVID-19 and how it sort of progressed across the world where you saw every market sort of going to some level of lockdown and then sort of open up a little bit. And what we saw with that when there was unknown, right, people seem to clamp down and really worry about a lot of things and focus on safety. And in the U.S. that period seemed to be the last two weeks of March more so than other periods. But that same arc has sort of pretty much repeated itself across the world. And in terms of the on-ramp for freemium, it's just too early to be talking about it. We're super excited to have freemium there. We're super excited that we were able to bring it forward at a time when our customers needed most. But it's just too early to talk about -- just yet. Now let me take ... Yeah, I think, Ray covered. You've seen us have been quite active over the last few months. And we have a pipeline, as we've said previously and we don't comment on any specific company which may or may not be part of our pipeline. And then maybe just touch on the WooCommerce point. We have a great position in the WordPress ecosystem, the WooCommerce product. And we have a tremendous partnership with automatic as well there. So, we have a great offer in the market. Now, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and our customers are loving it. So, we continue to like the offer we have there and continue to love customers coming to us with their WordPress and WooCommerce needs. Thank you. I'll just say a quick thank you to all the employees across GoDaddy globally. A tremendous amount of work has gone in over the last few weeks that have been challenging to say the least. But while all of us focused on supporting each other every person at GoDaddy has worked hard to support our customers and for that I'm truly grateful. Now, thanks for joining our call today and we'll see you next time."

        "content": "Christie Masoner: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR; gross merchandise volume, or GMV; and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalence may be found in the presentation posted to investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies are objective with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation; new product introductions and innovations; and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, February 10, 2022, and except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  With that, here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, we remain laser-focused on helping micro and small business owners succeed and grow their businesses. Our customers continue to show resilience and creativity through the pandemic, and our Q4 financial results were a strong end to a strong year. As we look back at 2021, I am excited by the unyielding acceleration in the pace of execution, best demonstrated by the integration of Poynt and the launch of the OmniCommerce offering. And we have a deep trust with our 21 million customers, evidenced by the 65-plus NPS we have in care and that in Q4, more than 60% of customers in the commerce tier of Websites + Marketing chose GoDaddy Payments over other established providers. We delivered strong growth in bookings, revenue and unlevered free cash flow in 2021, with Q4 being GoDaddy's first quarter of $1 billion in revenue. We ended the year with a significant outperformance in aftermarket, driven by sustained market demand. We continue to drive broad-based strength in our Create and Grow suite of products with ARR for them growing 19% year-over-year. And today, we announced a $3 billion share buyback program that Mark will cover in his section. While we delivered strong financial results, Omicron impacted our customers and our employees. In the U.S., the impact started to show late in the quarter as customer demand softened a little bit, and more and more employees were out sick due to the pandemic. As you might expect, the biggest operational impact of the higher absentee rates were in our care organization. As Omicron cases around the world have come down, we have seen better staffing in care and expect the impacts of Omicron to be limited to Q1 2022. Early this year, we named Roger Chen as our Chief Operating Officer. Roger has been with GoDaddy for over 6.5 years and led teams to strong financial results by focusing on operational excellence. He started with GoDaddy with the expansion of our international footprint and most recently, has been leading our Domains business. Roger is excited to meet you at our Investor Day tomorrow. With Roger's appointment, I am happy to share that we have a well-rounded and complete executive leadership team in place, and we are excited about the large opportunity in front of GoDaddy and confident in our ability to execute to him. As always, I will cover progress on our top 3 priorities today. Our top priority continues to be driving success in commerce through Presence. A year into the Poynt acquisition, we have made remarkable progress with the integration, kudos to all the teams involved. We completed several product launches for Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress, launching GoDaddy Payments midyear and the OmniCommerce product launch in September. We also recently launched a higher-end commerce SKU, which is currently being tested with a percentage of U.S. customers. We doubled the size of our Commerce team, and we intend to continue the rapid pace of product launches in 2022 as well. With the launch of our OmniCommerce offering in September, we took a giant step forward in our ability to serve our customers with a seamlessly intuitive experience. Our customers' need is to sell anything anywhere. And we are all in the early stages of the merging of the off-line and online Commerce experience, and we call this Connected Commerce.  We're pleased to share that right out of the gate, we're seeing some good early signs. Since the launch, we have sold over 1,000 point-of-sale devices and have received tens of thousands of GoDaddy Payments applications from customers. Most promising is that customers are choosing GoDaddy Payments in Websites + Marketing commerce tier, more than 60% of customers are choosing GoDaddy Payments. And in Managed WordPress where customers have over 140 choices, nearly 1/4 of customers are already choosing GoDaddy Payments. We're pleased to already be at this level of attach. We have also rapidly expanded our partnerships with Google, Facebook and Instagram to increase our customers' reach and boost their online profile. These integrations are making a real difference for our customers. Most of our customers double their website traffic when running a Facebook or Instagram ad. Additionally, GoDaddy Websites + Marketing customers who added their stores to social media, saw at least 2x increase in number of customers placing orders. Our customers' commerce needs are increasingly interconnected to the various different ways they show up. Recognizing this customer need, we have expanded our focus from online presence to what we call ubiquitous presence, which we'll discuss in more detail tomorrow. We know how and where customers show up is important to the way they connect with their customers, and GoDaddy has the solutions customers need. 1/3 of our customers link their websites to at least 1 social platform. And in Q4, we added the ability for customers to link their sites to 3 new social platforms, TikTok, Twitch & Discord. Since then, these new platforms account for 11% of all platforms that customers link from their websites with TikTok being the most popular. Another customer need is Biosites. Biosites have become an essential tool for our social first customers. And we're excited to support them through the launch of Social Site, GoDaddy Studios bio site capability. Consistent with our goal of meeting customers where they are, this tool empowers social-first entrepreneurs to set up a fantastic Social Site with GoDaddy Studios with just a few clicks, helping them grow their business by driving traffic to their top content. Our customers' customers are reaching them through many channels, chat on website, SMS, Facebook Messenger and much more. Having to check and respond to these various different channels is cumbersome and time consuming. With the acquisition of Re:amaze we quickly enabled a unified messaging inbox called Conversations in Websites + Marketing. It pulls in messages from a customer's website, Facebook Messenger, Instagram inbox and voice line, all into 1 convenient inbox. Customers can easily access, organize and respond to messages from multiple platforms fall in 1 place and never miss a sales opportunity. This feature is also available via mobile app for convenient access to messages on the go. This saves small business customers time, and they can quickly help their customers or enable automated chat bots that can help answer questions about order updates, shipping and more. And customers are already showing that they love it. Usage for the conversations feature jumped immediately, and we expect more and more Websites + Marketing customers to use this feature over the next few months. Our present solutions continue to be priced competitively, giving us short-term pricing opportunity and with higher customer engagement with features like conversations, we continue to build greater consumer surplus, which we expect will offer pricing opportunities in the future as well. The increased pace of execution here is also showing in our results. Across our Create and Grow products, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios, ARR grew to $410 million in 2021, an increase of approximately 19% year-over-year. We measure and share this metric as we believe it is indicative of future success in GoDaddy's high-growth areas and where we are funding innovation and capturing higher value customers.  Moving on to our second priority, GoDaddy Pros. As you are aware, we have a large number of Pros over 1.5 million in our customer base, a majority of them in our hosting business. Pros widely prefer WordPress, and we are committed to supporting them and supporting WordPress. More deeply engaging our Pro customer base continues to be one of the large opportunities in front of us, and we are working on exactly that. While we set and achieve an aggressive goal to register 300,000 Pros in our Pro Hub, we quickly shifted our focus to a steady set of feature launches driving monthly active users, or MAU. In Q4, we launched priority care ticketing, commission-based incentives, percent-based pricing for new reseller customers, client reports and more in the Hub. While it's early days on these new launches, all of these features demonstrate our commitment to provide a differentiated experience to our Pro customers, increasing the value we create for them. Our Pros customers use both Managed WordPress and hosting products with us. As Pros show greater preference for Managed WordPress, delivering the best experience across both is key to our relationship with them. In 2021, we started to upgrade the Hosting platform to a new optimized configuration, which has started to show significant performance improvements.  Notably, a 37% average improvement in server response times, improved NPS and a resulting 6% increase in renewal rates over a couple of quarters. And with our continued efforts to integrate Pagely, we will provide them with the best Managed WordPress offering for their customers as well. Our third priority is innovating in Domains. Our aftermarket business posted another remarkable quarter, led by significant market demand as we exited the year, driving increases in both the volume and size of transactions. While primary Domain Registrars growth remained solid, GoDaddy Registry successfully launched a Reputation Protection Solution contributing to strong growth in the Registry business. We also extended our Registry offering by winning the bid to be the exclusive issuer of .tv TLDs. The Domains business continues to be one of our most valued assets as it often serves as our first introduction to our customers while providing a significant launching Poynt to attach other products. We will share more on this at our Investor Day tomorrow.  Lastly, I wanted to highlight some key wins on the marketing front as a preview for some of the content in tomorrow's Investor Day. One of the areas of investment for us over the last year was the GoDaddy website. The team had set its sights on conversion improvement as the goal and by building and following a world-class experimentation-based software development approach, they realize meaningful incremental growth. We know that once a customer gets to our site, that's only the beginning. And our teams continue to work on continued improvement in engagement and conversion. We've also been working hard at spending marketing dollars more efficiently. Over the last few months with new leadership in place, we embarked on a journey to add advanced testing and measurement capabilities to make faster decisions on our marketing spend, strengthening our talent and execution in areas like data science has been key for us to be able to better discover opportunities for marketing efficiency and do the tests needed to understand incrementality even if it means turning off a channel for a couple of weeks. Fara will cover this area tomorrow at our Investor Day, and I continue to be excited to leverage our marketing spend more effectively. I also wanted to take a moment to welcome you to our Investor Day tomorrow. We will discuss our long-term strategy, innovation initiatives, refreshed capital allocation strategy, go-forward revenue presentation and 3-year guide. We are eager to spend additional time with all of you tomorrow. In closing, we're pleased with the results this quarter and with GoDaddy's progress against our key initiatives. We're delighted that the momentum in our biggest product release yet and even more delighted that our customers are demonstrating an appetite for it through the early signals of adoption. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, bringing important innovative solutions to customers, driving progress across the entire industry and delivering durable top line profitable growth, robust cash flow with a focus on disciplined capital allocation.  With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman, and hello. I am looking forward to connecting with everyone over the next 2 days. Today, I'll first touch on 2021 full year and fourth quarter financial results as well as an outlook for 2022. Tomorrow, at our Investor Day, I'll provide additional long-term guidance and introduce our new revenue disclosures and metrics. With that, let's move to our 2021 results. Total revenue for 2021 grew 15% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, exceeding our initial guidance on broad-based strength in new and renewal revenue attach and outperformance in our aftermarket. ARPU increased 10% to 182, and we added 600,000 net new customers in 2021 with continued strong retention and renewal rates. Moving on to our quarterly results. GoDaddy achieved a new quarterly revenue milestone of $1 billion, up 17% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. International revenue grew 13% on a reported basis with approximately 1 point of currency tailwind. Q4 Domains revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $497 million. Aftermarket was the primary driver of the strength in Domains contributing nearly 2/3 of the growth in this line, with the remainder attributable to acceleration in GoDaddy Registry and continued strong new registrations and renewals. Hosting and Presence revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $330 million in the fourth quarter. We continued to drive growth in our Create and Grow products with legacy hosting and security growing low single digits.  Q4 Hosting and Presence, Create and Grow ARR surpassed $410 million, growing 19% year-over-year. Within that suite, Q4 Websites + Marketing ARR grew 20% year-over-year. And more specifically, Websites + Marketing Commerce ARR grew 24%, demonstrating our Commerce opportunity in Websites + Marketing. As Commerce becomes more pronounced in our products, we'll continue to evolve this disclosure as we have multiple paths of growth for Commerce and more products in our suite. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $26 billion in 2021, growing 21% year-over-year. Business Applications revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $192 million on continued strength in branded e-mail and productivity solutions as customers continue to attach add seats and up-level their solutions. Bookings grew to $1.1 billion, improving 11% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Growth was broad-based with continued strength across product categories, including strength in aftermarket. Gross margin was down slightly in the low end of the mid-60s for the quarter. Product mix, particularly strength in aftermarket, continues to drive the company's overall gross margin. Investment in tech and dev was consistent with last quarter as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation while maintaining fiscal discipline. We continue to get leverage in G&A as travel and other office expenses remain below historical levels. One item to note is that during Q4, we continued the consolidation of our Arizona offices, resulting in a closure of 1 office and a $15 million onetime charge in our restructuring and other line. This offset the $15 million gain recognized last quarter from the sale of another Arizona office as we continue to simplify our physical footprint. As Aman noted earlier, we drove efficiency in our marketing spend, although our investment remained strong in Q4 and consistent with Q3. Year-over-year saw a deceleration in our spend as we lapped the elevated investment we made in 2020 to capture the extraordinary demand. As we continue to refine our marketing return engine, we remain focused adjusting our marketing spend as macro environments fluctuate. Our growth and investment in the fourth quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $254 million, representing growth of 29% year-over-year from continued profitability, disciplined hiring and leveraging OpEx as we continue to benefit from work at home and decreased travel. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, growing 12% year-over-year. Full year unlevered free cash flow grew 16% year-over-year to $960 million, in line with our guidance. Positive working capital impacts as well as reduced capital expenditures for corporate real estate and infrastructure was offset by the lower margin profile of our top line outperformance. On the balance sheet, we exited the year with $1.3 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.9 billion. Net debt landed at $2.7 billion, below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4x. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model have fueled a strong balance sheet, enabling us to address our capital allocation priorities. In 2021, we completed 6 acquisitions and repurchased nearly 4% of our outstanding equity. In addition, today, we announced our intent to buy back $3 billion of shares through 2024. This represents utilization of approximately 80% of our projected free cash flow over the next 3 years and is expected to drive a material reduction in our share count. We also announced we expect to launch a $750 million ASR this quarter, which shows our commitment to aggressive use of the new $3 billion repurchase authorization. We are committed to increasing the value we create for shareholders by growing our free cash flow and reducing our share count over time. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for 2022. We expect total annual revenue to be within a range of $4.14 billion to $4.16 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint of the range. In Q1 2022, we are targeting total revenue of $985 million to $990 million. This represents 10% growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect 2022 unlevered free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion or 15% growth versus 2021. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, income tax payments of approximately $20 million and cash interest payments of approximately $120 million. The global pandemic has affected a lot of businesses in SMBs, the time line of which has varied by market, geography and customer type. Because of this variability forward-looking guidance based on years that were impacted or benefited by COVID can be challenging. As such, it's important to call out that guidance we're providing today shows continued business momentum. Yet comes off a strong year of outperformance in 2021, which makes for tough comps in the near term. Tomorrow at Investor Day, we will discuss multiyear growth targets and levers, which provide a better picture of the potential we see and the shareholder value it will create. We are committed to providing the information you need to model the business confidently, value the business effectively and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objectives. In addition to incremental disclosures and metrics, we will spend our time with you tomorrow discussing the company's long-term strategy, key innovation initiatives and updated capital allocation strategy and as I mentioned, a multiyear outlook. We'll end the day with Q&A hosted by our management team. Given we have Investor Day tomorrow, we ask that you limit questions today to our 2021 results and the information we've provided in our prepared remarks. We have ample information to share with you tomorrow, and we will have time to go into more details then. With that, I'll hand the call over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&A\nChristie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays.\nTrevor Young: Great. First, on Domains in 4Q. Obviously, sizable outperformance relative to the commentary last quarter, which I think was pointing to low double-digit growth. What drove the strength in aftermarket as I think the expectation was that there were some tailwinds that started in 4Q of '20 from new inventory unlock that were sort of expected to abate? And then specifically within core Domains, was there better retention or an uptick in new registrations? Or was most of the incremental growth there from the Reputation Protection Solution service that you launched?\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Trevor, and good to see you. Good to hear from you. Just real quick on the outperformance in looking at aftermarket. We couldn't be more excited at the momentum we're seeing in the marketplace today around our aftermarket. As we exited the year, we saw an uptick in both volume and average deal size and we exited with deals that we're pacing at a great momentum. Just a reminder, it's a transactional business. So the sales cycle is short on those, so our visibility out in any period can be limited. But we're going to talk about it a little bit more tomorrow, but we couldn't be more excited at the momentum as we continue to see great demand in the market related to the platform. On Domains, we saw strength across the board. Customer retention rates remain strong. We also had added benefit from the Registry items that we noted. So when I look at it across the quarter, it's broad-based, clearly driven by aftermarket was the big pickup, but we saw strength across the board.\nTrevor Young: That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up, if I may. On the 3% customer growth throughout the year, can you just talk about how that trended in 4Q versus earlier in the year? I think Aman noted some maybe softness later in the quarter related to Omicron. And then have you seen that improvement in customer demand kind of uptick?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, I'm happy to jump in on that, Trevor. Yes, as I noted in the prepared remarks, Omicron did have a slight demand impact. And it has continued going into January as well. But as I said, we expect that sort of be limited to Q1 of 2022 in terms of impact. Just reflecting on the full year of 2021, as you might expect, sort of the growth was a reflection of the sort of outperformance in 2022 -- in 2020, given just the huge forward we had a 1.4 million net new customers in 2020.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler.\nQ \u2013Clarke Jeffries: First one is just maybe a reflection on what's resonating most with those customers that are adopting GoDaddy Payments. A little surprised to see nearly 25% of Managed WordPress customers convert. Just wondering if you had any kind of insights on what was the reason for them choosing GoDaddy? And what method was the sort of outreach or communication with those customers to kind of prompt the conversion?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Clarke. Just to clarify, when we talk about Managed WordPress customers and 25 percentage is the customer sort of signing up for Commerce tier and 25% of them are choosing GoDaddy Payments over the 140 options they have in Managed WordPress today, and we're super excited about it. And in terms of what's driving that, we continue to have a team that is focused on sort of surfacing GoDaddy Payments, making sure customers see it, they understand what we're offering. And of course, we have really competitive pricing in the market. We think we're at a price point that is attractive for our customers that allows us to reach customers in a manner that sort of breaks through the other players, and that's been helpful for us.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. And then maybe one follow-up. Certainly encouraging to see the appetite to invest in the Commerce effort, both on the product side and the people side. I was particularly interested in the testing of a higher-end SKU for the commerce tier. I was wondering if you could help frame the sleeve of the market that you see as the opportunity for that higher-end solution, maybe bracket where you would like to go with that SKU?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. We'll actually cover it quite -- in quite a lot of detail tomorrow, so I won't sort of cover it all today. But just as we talked about it a little bit, we're bringing a lot more value to the table with the integration of Poynt. Customer with GoDaddy now can not only sell sort of in their online stores, sell on the major platforms or on social media and in their physical store. We have a number of things like the Commerce Hub that bring it all together and make it very, very simple. So what we're doing is packaging up the best of that into a higher-end SKU. It's actually now available in the U.S. If you go to the website, you may not see. But if you try a few times, you will because it's sort of being AB test right now to see what sort of adoption we get for that higher-end SKU. But I will touch on more sort of related to Commerce and why we're so excited about Connected Commerce tomorrow.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Jo-Ann Lee from Evercore ISI.\nJo-Ann Lee: Just the -- I guess follow-up on the kind of the Q1 outlook where you said that you expect the Omnicon impact to be limited in Q1. If you can talk a little bit more about what gives you confidence about that projection? Is there anything that you're seeing that kind of is pointing in the right direction? And if there's any color around the segment growth assumptions you can share? And where we could see upside to that full year guide?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Jo-Ann. Let me take the first part, and I'll turn the second over to Mark. On Omicron what the data we're looking at is both sort of across the world, the number of cases. And you know those charts as well as we do. And a little bit of our experience over the last 2 years, where if you remember a couple of years ago, as COVID started for a couple of quarters, we had talked about the COVID Arc whereas we saw cases increase, we saw sort of shifts in customer behavior and demand. And we think we're seeing something similar here where with the rise of Omicron, we see it in our own employee base, too, especially with care employees. And as cases have come down, our expectation is that things will sort of get back to normal, if you will.  And Mark, I'll turn the second part over to you.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Aman. I'll ask it, we're going to talk a lot about segments tomorrow and some of our repositioning of our product pillars. So hang on tight with that question, if that's okay. I don't want to give away the lead story tomorrow. Having said that, on the upside, right, we couldn't have been more thrilled with the upside we saw in the market around aftermarket. And as I mentioned previously, it is a transactional business with a short sales cycle, and we're seeing great momentum in both volume and average deal size because it's transactional, it can provide some upside going forward. Now we don't have line of sight to that, and that's generally how we guide. But in answer to your question, we're excited about the upside there.\nJo-Ann Lee: Great. If I may, just a quick follow-up on just the marketing. It looks like there's a little bit of marketing leverage this quarter. I know you guys talked about and probably we'll talk more about the marketing efficiency efforts. Is that mostly what's driving the leverage this quarter? Or if you can talk through the marketing spend environment, the CAC trend for Q4 and maybe Q1?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Let me touch on sort of the approach to marketing overall, Jo-Ann, and then maybe perhaps Mark can just touch on the leverage sort of across the other line items. Our approach to marketing over the last couple of years has been that when the demand was high, we wanted to make sure we lean into that demand. We wanted to make sure the customer we've maintained our share of voice and customers knew that GoDaddy had entered into Commerce. And we'll actually share more on that topic with you tomorrow as well. But as demand came down, we wanted to sort of bring the spend down with it, but not too fast. We didn't want to drag demand down for GoDaddy. So you saw us sort of bring that the demand -- the spend down as the demand came down. And in terms of leverage on the line items, I don't know, Mark, if you could just talk about that for a moment.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And the great thing about our model and our durable revenue and our ability to generate cash is we can do so great attach, increasing ARPU and get better leverage because our business is sticky. And we continue to see that in marketing. We continue to see that in care. As our relationships grow, our ability to upsell and cross-sell, just get easier and we get better leverage out of it.  On top of that, we will continue to get leverage out of G&A. As we look to simplify our footprint, we're investing a lot in moving to the cloud. So again, the thing I love about our operating model is it flexible to agile and it creates a lot of leverage for us to both return cash to our shareholders as well as invest in durable growth.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush.\nYgal Arounian: I guess, Aman, you mentioned getting back to normal after COVID. So even after kind of the Omicron wave or outside of that, there's been investor concern just in the space broadly about demand, the demands have been pulled forward that overall demand levels are not just this year, but over the coming years, might be different. We've seen the kind of the new business application numbers come back down to normal. Whether just it's framed within the outlook or just kind of overall, how do you see the normal? What is the new normal? And what should we expect? I'm sure we'll touch on it tomorrow. It's kind of hard to parse out the long term from this. But maybe framed within the guidance, and then I have one follow-up.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I'll let Mark touch on the guidance, but Ygal, you asked a very hard question. And as you framed it yourself, no crystal ball to really be able to say how the demand looks or how the pandemic continues to impact demand or small businesses. I think the way we're looking at it is that 2020 was just a unique year. It was very, very different. And for multiple quarters, seasonality disappeared from the business, and every quarter was a bit different and very hard to look at. Now we tend to see more and more data points what I'll call normal seasonality is back in the business. And of course, it's going to be very hard to sort of see demand at the 2020 levels as a lot of companies saw. But the way -- when I say normal, what I mean is the normal seasonality pattern a bit more predictable demand that we are used to expecting in our business.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. And then on the follow-up, I just want to make sure I understand the Payments adoption correctly. So are you saying at 60% of new Commerce hubs that are taking GoDaddy Payments? How should we think about that on renewals and kind of what the pace of overall adoption has been or what it can be?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, Ygal, we should absolutely see those as new customers coming to GoDaddy, going through Websites + Marketing or Managed WordPress and the rate at which they're adopting GoDaddy Payments, right? But we -- it's too early to talk about our existing base. We do think we have an amazing product, GoDaddy Payments. We have great pricing, a great brand and there's an opportunity with our existing customers, but it's too early to talk about renewal cycle or things like that. We're literally almost like 6 months into GoDaddy Payments. So it's very, very early.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. We should think in another 6 months is the kind of first big renewal cycle where people might start picking up GoDaddy Payments to previous customers.\nAman Bhutani: When we do have more on it, Yigal, we'll definitely share a little bit with you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Elliott from Morgan Stanley.\nElizabeth Elliott: Congrats on the strong quarter. I don't want to dig in on the monetization per user. We got the customer count for the first time. And in a year and overall ARPU growth was pretty impressive. So I wanted to get some color on what type of uplift you're seeing in spend per customer and any trends to call out in the behavior of how new customers are landing versus kind of the existing customer base expanding?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, I'm happy to jump in first on that, Elizabeth. When we think about overall customer, just to take the last part of your question, new customers, we continue to see -- if you take the sort of 2-year cycle instead of the 1-year cycle, I would say we see very consistent patterns with new customers. And we're particularly happy with the ARPU growth. It is a bit accelerated versus previous years. And we're very happy to see it. Our goal, of course, is to continue to maintain that type of ARPU growth. That's why we have the higher-priced products, the greater offering with Commerce. And we will touch on this tomorrow as well to just show you, again, the lifetime value of the customer as we attach more products with them, especially as we get into Commerce and how that opens up a bit more of the TAM for GoDaddy.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And I'll just add to that, Elizabeth, good to talk about again. Couldn't be more thrilled with the customer adds and the ARPU and the momentum. Really excited just showing the durability of the model and the strength of it going forward and the predictability of the revenue and the cash flow that we'll have into the future to invest and return to shareholders.\nElizabeth Elliott: Got it. And then I just wanted a quick follow-up on Omicron that you highlighted, the headwind kind of limited to more Q1. Any color on you guys that Omicron impact to the Q1 guidance? Or any other headwinds, tailwinds like FX to call up to the growth in Q1?\nAman Bhutani: Nothing more to add on the Omicron piece, Elizabeth, versus what I just already shared in terms of what we see in the cases, what we see in our employee base. We have the benefit of having a very large care organization that gets a lot of calls from customers. So we get a little bit, if you will, color on how people are feeling or doing. So that's what our estimate is based on. And in terms of FX, maybe Mark, you could weigh on that.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes, absolutely. And I think we're comfortable with the guidance that we're giving out here. We've seen the Omicron hit in January with our care, like Aman mentioned. We think it's limited. Obviously, we can't predict any other variants or other things happening out there for the quarter. But I think we're very comfortable right now with where we're pegging Q1.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Just on use of capital, you're committing to a fairly large buyback in the ASR. I guess when you think about just the overall ability to do tactical M&A, can you give us a sense of is the buyback to the way given how significant that commitment is? Or are you leaving yourself enough wiggle room to do some tuck-in M&A going forward?\nMark McCaffrey: Brent, perfect question, right? I would say we're going to get into the capital allocation strategy tomorrow. But one of the great things about our model, just leading up tomorrow is we have the ability to generate a lot of cash because of our predictability and bearability, but also look at other items that can accelerate growth and grow our business over the long term. So as I think I said in Q3, very much and versus an or for us and looking forward to getting the details of how we're thinking about that moving forward tomorrow.\nBrent Thill: Great. And Aman, when you think about some of the new product features, there's -- you've given -- there's a lot of great innovation. I guess when you think about kind of the 1 or 2 areas that you're most excited by, can you just give us your sense, we understand you love all your products equally, but 1 or 2 is standing out to you?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I'm particularly excited about our top priority, which is Commerce and bringing Commerce to every surface that we have, Brent. You will see that tomorrow, I have picked at least 1 idea that I'm particularly excited about. So I go into a bit of detail. I won't showcase it now, but suffice to say that just bringing Commerce to every surface of the company is what I'm most excited about.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan.\nDrew Glaeser: This is Drew on for Sterling. Revisiting the OmniCommerce solution, I was wondering if you could speak to the trends you're seeing in customer behavior more specifically in the split between shopping in-store versus online?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Drew. It's a bit too early to be giving our numbers on the OmniCommerce solution. We did share that we shipped -- we've got over 1,000 orders of point of sale. So definitely, customers are starting to realize that we have this solution and that they're excited to adopt it, but it's too early to be talking about split in terms of what we're seeing. We need a few more quarters of data and before we could talk about that.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner : Yes\nDeepak Mathivanan: So just a couple of questions, and apologies if this was already addressed. On that $40 million outperformance on the aftermarket side in Domains, was the contribution to fourth quarter bookings roughly the same because I mean if I exclude that, it seems like bookings were up like 7%, is that math accurate? Can you help with what are the factors of deceleration, if that's accurate? And then also related to that, on the first quarter guide, how should we think about this aftermarket contribution? And that you have factored into revenues? And then also maybe some color on bookings would be great?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. A couple of things. On -- just on the aftermarket part of it, and I'll try to bridge this from Q4 to Q1. It's a transactional business. So it impacts both bookings and revenue when it's recorded, but does not impact deferred revenue at the end of any given period. So it can provide upside in any given quarter, but does not have a what I'd call deferred revenue impact in future periods. So our visibility into any given quarter could provide variability. On the deferred revenue, I would say we're coming off of 2020 cohorts that were very large and we're coming into 2021 cohorts that are a little smaller. So we're seeing the deferred revenue balances come down based on that trend, but that's generally what you're seeing out there.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. If I can just follow up on that. So should we expect this trend to also continue in 2022?\nMark McCaffrey: So Deepak, I would say we're seeing great momentum in 2022 when it relates to continuing to grow our business and provide durable revenue. We are excited about the momentum of the aftermarket, but it's still early stage for us to see that momentum and the variability will have from quarter-to-quarter. We are extraordinarily excited at the volume of the transactions going up, the average deal size going up. So we expect some momentum. But like I said, it can vary from quarter-to-quarter.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair.\nMatt Pfau: First wanted to ask for 2022 if it'd be possible if you could give us some direction on how you're thinking about the growth by your 3 different revenue line items?\nAman Bhutani: Matt, I'm going to give you the -- hey, can we wait until tomorrow. We're disclosing some new information on how we're going to be describing our revenue pillars going forward, and I think that will be able to answer your questions.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great. And then to follow up on some of the previous questions about ARPU and customer growth. If we look prior to the pandemic, your overall revenue growth was kind of split evenly between customer growth and ARPU. And then obviously, the last 2 years have been not normal. How are you thinking about the split between those 2 drivers as we move forward here?\nAman Bhutani: Matt, the way I think about it, and Aman can add on to me the way I think about it is we have great opportunities going forward coming out of the pandemic, both to attract new customers as well as upsell our existing customer base. And while we don't get into which one is going to provide more, we think both create an exceptional opportunity for us to continue to grow the business at a durable rate which we've shown over time we can do.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist.\nNaved Khan: Can you hear me?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes.\nNaved Khan: So I just wanted to touch on the inflationary environment there in and how we think -- how you are thinking about the additional pressures on your P&L as well as maybe your ability to cut asset on to your customer base? And then secondarily, just on e-commerce, I think last year, Aman, I think you spoke about maybe 1/4 of your new customer kind of customers being an e-commerce customer. Is that still the case? Is that mix holding up? Or -- has it kind of come back down to more normal levels or maybe even gone up?\nMark McCaffrey: I'll take the first part of that, and maybe Aman, you can take the second part of that, the inflationary comment. Obviously, we're living in interesting times with inflations, and we saw a lot in the press today. The fallback I always look at it is, hey, we have a very durable model that has been around for a while, and we've seen the ups and the downs, and we've been able to continue to generate growth, continue to move forward. So we'll see what the ultimate impact in the macro is around inflation, but we're confident that we continue to meet our strategic objectives going forward. Example I always used to use or like to use, I think in 2008, our cohort has generated $1.9 billion over the period of time, which is fantastic when you think about that looking back at what that type of macro environment was. So we believe our model remains durable.\nAman Bhutani: And Naved, on the Websites + Marketing, e-commerce customers, I think that's the data point you were referencing. We did share today the Websites + Marketing had grown 20%, but the Commerce SKU had been growing 24%. So we continue to see more customers in -- and that was ARR number. So we continue to see more attention in the Commerce SKU. And as I've shared earlier, we're actually launching a higher-end Commerce SKU, and it's testing in the U.S. now. So in terms of that -- in terms of the overall business, Commerce is becoming a bigger part of our Websites + Marketing business.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Rajgopal from Berenberg Capital Markets.\nSunil Rajgopal: Can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner : We can.\nSunil Rajgopal: All right. Can you shed some light on what is impacting the gross margins this quarter? And secondly, what does the management think about the recent announcement from Apple turning their handsets into payment terminals?\nMark McCaffrey: I'll take the first part of that. And Aman, maybe you take the second part of that. The gross margin this quarter was impacted by aftermarket. It's a lower gross margin point than some of our other products. So the outperformance impacted our gross margin. We still feel very confident in our operating margin and our ability to grow normalized EBITDA given the leverage that those models actually provide for us. But that is -- and the aftermarket did provide some downward pressure on our gross margin.\nAman Bhutani: And Sunil, on the Apple announcement, again, I'll touch on this tomorrow, but we have a firm belief that the commerce use cases are going to appear on every surface that exists. And be tightly coupled to every product that's out there that where it makes sense. So I actually touch on it tomorrow a bit to share at GoDaddy, we believe that Commerce use cases are just going to be Omnipresent on everything we do. So no surprise that Apple is sort of bringing forward capability that allows folks to sort of tap in there just with the icon.\nChristie Masoner : At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Aman. Aman, please to share some closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to spending more time with you tomorrow at our Investor Day. And I'll just end by thanking all the GoDaddy employees all over the world for another great quarter and all the hard work they put in coming in every day with everything else going on. Thank you very much.",

            "content": "Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, we remain laser-focused on helping micro and small business owners succeed and grow their businesses. Our customers continue to show resilience and creativity through the pandemic, and our Q4 financial results were a strong end to a strong year. As we look back at 2021, I am excited by the unyielding acceleration in the pace of execution, best demonstrated by the integration of Poynt and the launch of the OmniCommerce offering. And we have a deep trust with our 21 million customers, evidenced by the 65-plus NPS we have in care and that in Q4, more than 60% of customers in the commerce tier of Websites + Marketing chose GoDaddy Payments over other established providers. We delivered strong growth in bookings, revenue and unlevered free cash flow in 2021, with Q4 being GoDaddy's first quarter of $1 billion in revenue. We ended the year with a significant outperformance in aftermarket, driven by sustained market demand. We continue to drive broad-based strength in our Create and Grow suite of products with ARR for them growing 19% year-over-year. And today, we announced a $3 billion share buyback program that Mark will cover in his section. While we delivered strong financial results, Omicron impacted our customers and our employees. In the U.S., the impact started to show late in the quarter as customer demand softened a little bit, and more and more employees were out sick due to the pandemic. As you might expect, the biggest operational impact of the higher absentee rates were in our care organization. As Omicron cases around the world have come down, we have seen better staffing in care and expect the impacts of Omicron to be limited to Q1 2022. Early this year, we named Roger Chen as our Chief Operating Officer. Roger has been with GoDaddy for over 6.5 years and led teams to strong financial results by focusing on operational excellence. He started with GoDaddy with the expansion of our international footprint and most recently, has been leading our Domains business. Roger is excited to meet you at our Investor Day tomorrow. With Roger's appointment, I am happy to share that we have a well-rounded and complete executive leadership team in place, and we are excited about the large opportunity in front of GoDaddy and confident in our ability to execute to him. As always, I will cover progress on our top 3 priorities today. Our top priority continues to be driving success in commerce through Presence. A year into the Poynt acquisition, we have made remarkable progress with the integration, kudos to all the teams involved. We completed several product launches for Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress, launching GoDaddy Payments midyear and the OmniCommerce product launch in September. We also recently launched a higher-end commerce SKU, which is currently being tested with a percentage of U.S. customers. We doubled the size of our Commerce team, and we intend to continue the rapid pace of product launches in 2022 as well. With the launch of our OmniCommerce offering in September, we took a giant step forward in our ability to serve our customers with a seamlessly intuitive experience. Our customers' need is to sell anything anywhere. And we are all in the early stages of the merging of the off-line and online Commerce experience, and we call this Connected Commerce.  We're pleased to share that right out of the gate, we're seeing some good early signs. Since the launch, we have sold over 1,000 point-of-sale devices and have received tens of thousands of GoDaddy Payments applications from customers. Most promising is that customers are choosing GoDaddy Payments in Websites + Marketing commerce tier, more than 60% of customers are choosing GoDaddy Payments. And in Managed WordPress where customers have over 140 choices, nearly 1/4 of customers are already choosing GoDaddy Payments. We're pleased to already be at this level of attach. We have also rapidly expanded our partnerships with Google, Facebook and Instagram to increase our customers' reach and boost their online profile. These integrations are making a real difference for our customers. Most of our customers double their website traffic when running a Facebook or Instagram ad. Additionally, GoDaddy Websites + Marketing customers who added their stores to social media, saw at least 2x increase in number of customers placing orders. Our customers' commerce needs are increasingly interconnected to the various different ways they show up. Recognizing this customer need, we have expanded our focus from online presence to what we call ubiquitous presence, which we'll discuss in more detail tomorrow. We know how and where customers show up is important to the way they connect with their customers, and GoDaddy has the solutions customers need. 1/3 of our customers link their websites to at least 1 social platform. And in Q4, we added the ability for customers to link their sites to 3 new social platforms, TikTok, Twitch & Discord. Since then, these new platforms account for 11% of all platforms that customers link from their websites with TikTok being the most popular. Another customer need is Biosites. Biosites have become an essential tool for our social first customers. And we're excited to support them through the launch of Social Site, GoDaddy Studios bio site capability. Consistent with our goal of meeting customers where they are, this tool empowers social-first entrepreneurs to set up a fantastic Social Site with GoDaddy Studios with just a few clicks, helping them grow their business by driving traffic to their top content. Our customers' customers are reaching them through many channels, chat on website, SMS, Facebook Messenger and much more. Having to check and respond to these various different channels is cumbersome and time consuming. With the acquisition of Re:amaze we quickly enabled a unified messaging inbox called Conversations in Websites + Marketing. It pulls in messages from a customer's website, Facebook Messenger, Instagram inbox and voice line, all into 1 convenient inbox. Customers can easily access, organize and respond to messages from multiple platforms fall in 1 place and never miss a sales opportunity. This feature is also available via mobile app for convenient access to messages on the go. This saves small business customers time, and they can quickly help their customers or enable automated chat bots that can help answer questions about order updates, shipping and more. And customers are already showing that they love it. Usage for the conversations feature jumped immediately, and we expect more and more Websites + Marketing customers to use this feature over the next few months. Our present solutions continue to be priced competitively, giving us short-term pricing opportunity and with higher customer engagement with features like conversations, we continue to build greater consumer surplus, which we expect will offer pricing opportunities in the future as well. The increased pace of execution here is also showing in our results. Across our Create and Grow products, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios, ARR grew to $410 million in 2021, an increase of approximately 19% year-over-year. We measure and share this metric as we believe it is indicative of future success in GoDaddy's high-growth areas and where we are funding innovation and capturing higher value customers.  Moving on to our second priority, GoDaddy Pros. As you are aware, we have a large number of Pros over 1.5 million in our customer base, a majority of them in our hosting business. Pros widely prefer WordPress, and we are committed to supporting them and supporting WordPress. More deeply engaging our Pro customer base continues to be one of the large opportunities in front of us, and we are working on exactly that. While we set and achieve an aggressive goal to register 300,000 Pros in our Pro Hub, we quickly shifted our focus to a steady set of feature launches driving monthly active users, or MAU. In Q4, we launched priority care ticketing, commission-based incentives, percent-based pricing for new reseller customers, client reports and more in the Hub. While it's early days on these new launches, all of these features demonstrate our commitment to provide a differentiated experience to our Pro customers, increasing the value we create for them. Our Pros customers use both Managed WordPress and hosting products with us. As Pros show greater preference for Managed WordPress, delivering the best experience across both is key to our relationship with them. In 2021, we started to upgrade the Hosting platform to a new optimized configuration, which has started to show significant performance improvements.  Notably, a 37% average improvement in server response times, improved NPS and a resulting 6% increase in renewal rates over a couple of quarters. And with our continued efforts to integrate Pagely, we will provide them with the best Managed WordPress offering for their customers as well. Our third priority is innovating in Domains. Our aftermarket business posted another remarkable quarter, led by significant market demand as we exited the year, driving increases in both the volume and size of transactions. While primary Domain Registrars growth remained solid, GoDaddy Registry successfully launched a Reputation Protection Solution contributing to strong growth in the Registry business. We also extended our Registry offering by winning the bid to be the exclusive issuer of .tv TLDs. The Domains business continues to be one of our most valued assets as it often serves as our first introduction to our customers while providing a significant launching Poynt to attach other products. We will share more on this at our Investor Day tomorrow.  Lastly, I wanted to highlight some key wins on the marketing front as a preview for some of the content in tomorrow's Investor Day. One of the areas of investment for us over the last year was the GoDaddy website. The team had set its sights on conversion improvement as the goal and by building and following a world-class experimentation-based software development approach, they realize meaningful incremental growth. We know that once a customer gets to our site, that's only the beginning. And our teams continue to work on continued improvement in engagement and conversion. We've also been working hard at spending marketing dollars more efficiently. Over the last few months with new leadership in place, we embarked on a journey to add advanced testing and measurement capabilities to make faster decisions on our marketing spend, strengthening our talent and execution in areas like data science has been key for us to be able to better discover opportunities for marketing efficiency and do the tests needed to understand incrementality even if it means turning off a channel for a couple of weeks. Fara will cover this area tomorrow at our Investor Day, and I continue to be excited to leverage our marketing spend more effectively. I also wanted to take a moment to welcome you to our Investor Day tomorrow. We will discuss our long-term strategy, innovation initiatives, refreshed capital allocation strategy, go-forward revenue presentation and 3-year guide. We are eager to spend additional time with all of you tomorrow. In closing, we're pleased with the results this quarter and with GoDaddy's progress against our key initiatives. We're delighted that the momentum in our biggest product release yet and even more delighted that our customers are demonstrating an appetite for it through the early signals of adoption. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, bringing important innovative solutions to customers, driving progress across the entire industry and delivering durable top line profitable growth, robust cash flow with a focus on disciplined capital allocation.  With that, here's Mark. Yes, I'm happy to jump in on that, Trevor. Yes, as I noted in the prepared remarks, Omicron did have a slight demand impact. And it has continued going into January as well. But as I said, we expect that sort of be limited to Q1 of 2022 in terms of impact. Just reflecting on the full year of 2021, as you might expect, sort of the growth was a reflection of the sort of outperformance in 2022 -- in 2020, given just the huge forward we had a 1.4 million net new customers in 2020. Yes. Thanks, Clarke. Just to clarify, when we talk about Managed WordPress customers and 25 percentage is the customer sort of signing up for Commerce tier and 25% of them are choosing GoDaddy Payments over the 140 options they have in Managed WordPress today, and we're super excited about it. And in terms of what's driving that, we continue to have a team that is focused on sort of surfacing GoDaddy Payments, making sure customers see it, they understand what we're offering. And of course, we have really competitive pricing in the market. We think we're at a price point that is attractive for our customers that allows us to reach customers in a manner that sort of breaks through the other players, and that's been helpful for us. Yes. We'll actually cover it quite -- in quite a lot of detail tomorrow, so I won't sort of cover it all today. But just as we talked about it a little bit, we're bringing a lot more value to the table with the integration of Poynt. Customer with GoDaddy now can not only sell sort of in their online stores, sell on the major platforms or on social media and in their physical store. We have a number of things like the Commerce Hub that bring it all together and make it very, very simple. So what we're doing is packaging up the best of that into a higher-end SKU. It's actually now available in the U.S. If you go to the website, you may not see. But if you try a few times, you will because it's sort of being AB test right now to see what sort of adoption we get for that higher-end SKU. But I will touch on more sort of related to Commerce and why we're so excited about Connected Commerce tomorrow. Yes. Thanks, Jo-Ann. Let me take the first part, and I'll turn the second over to Mark. On Omicron what the data we're looking at is both sort of across the world, the number of cases. And you know those charts as well as we do. And a little bit of our experience over the last 2 years, where if you remember a couple of years ago, as COVID started for a couple of quarters, we had talked about the COVID Arc whereas we saw cases increase, we saw sort of shifts in customer behavior and demand. And we think we're seeing something similar here where with the rise of Omicron, we see it in our own employee base, too, especially with care employees. And as cases have come down, our expectation is that things will sort of get back to normal, if you will.  And Mark, I'll turn the second part over to you. Yes. Let me touch on sort of the approach to marketing overall, Jo-Ann, and then maybe perhaps Mark can just touch on the leverage sort of across the other line items. Our approach to marketing over the last couple of years has been that when the demand was high, we wanted to make sure we lean into that demand. We wanted to make sure the customer we've maintained our share of voice and customers knew that GoDaddy had entered into Commerce. And we'll actually share more on that topic with you tomorrow as well. But as demand came down, we wanted to sort of bring the spend down with it, but not too fast. We didn't want to drag demand down for GoDaddy. So you saw us sort of bring that the demand -- the spend down as the demand came down. And in terms of leverage on the line items, I don't know, Mark, if you could just talk about that for a moment. Yes. I'll let Mark touch on the guidance, but Ygal, you asked a very hard question. And as you framed it yourself, no crystal ball to really be able to say how the demand looks or how the pandemic continues to impact demand or small businesses. I think the way we're looking at it is that 2020 was just a unique year. It was very, very different. And for multiple quarters, seasonality disappeared from the business, and every quarter was a bit different and very hard to look at. Now we tend to see more and more data points what I'll call normal seasonality is back in the business. And of course, it's going to be very hard to sort of see demand at the 2020 levels as a lot of companies saw. But the way -- when I say normal, what I mean is the normal seasonality pattern a bit more predictable demand that we are used to expecting in our business. Yes, Ygal, we should absolutely see those as new customers coming to GoDaddy, going through Websites + Marketing or Managed WordPress and the rate at which they're adopting GoDaddy Payments, right? But we -- it's too early to talk about our existing base. We do think we have an amazing product, GoDaddy Payments. We have great pricing, a great brand and there's an opportunity with our existing customers, but it's too early to talk about renewal cycle or things like that. We're literally almost like 6 months into GoDaddy Payments. So it's very, very early. When we do have more on it, Yigal, we'll definitely share a little bit with you. Yes, I'm happy to jump in first on that, Elizabeth. When we think about overall customer, just to take the last part of your question, new customers, we continue to see -- if you take the sort of 2-year cycle instead of the 1-year cycle, I would say we see very consistent patterns with new customers. And we're particularly happy with the ARPU growth. It is a bit accelerated versus previous years. And we're very happy to see it. Our goal, of course, is to continue to maintain that type of ARPU growth. That's why we have the higher-priced products, the greater offering with Commerce. And we will touch on this tomorrow as well to just show you, again, the lifetime value of the customer as we attach more products with them, especially as we get into Commerce and how that opens up a bit more of the TAM for GoDaddy. Nothing more to add on the Omicron piece, Elizabeth, versus what I just already shared in terms of what we see in the cases, what we see in our employee base. We have the benefit of having a very large care organization that gets a lot of calls from customers. So we get a little bit, if you will, color on how people are feeling or doing. So that's what our estimate is based on. And in terms of FX, maybe Mark, you could weigh on that. Yes. I'm particularly excited about our top priority, which is Commerce and bringing Commerce to every surface that we have, Brent. You will see that tomorrow, I have picked at least 1 idea that I'm particularly excited about. So I go into a bit of detail. I won't showcase it now, but suffice to say that just bringing Commerce to every surface of the company is what I'm most excited about. Yes. Thanks, Drew. It's a bit too early to be giving our numbers on the OmniCommerce solution. We did share that we shipped -- we've got over 1,000 orders of point of sale. So definitely, customers are starting to realize that we have this solution and that they're excited to adopt it, but it's too early to be talking about split in terms of what we're seeing. We need a few more quarters of data and before we could talk about that. Matt, I'm going to give you the -- hey, can we wait until tomorrow. We're disclosing some new information on how we're going to be describing our revenue pillars going forward, and I think that will be able to answer your questions. Matt, the way I think about it, and Aman can add on to me the way I think about it is we have great opportunities going forward coming out of the pandemic, both to attract new customers as well as upsell our existing customer base. And while we don't get into which one is going to provide more, we think both create an exceptional opportunity for us to continue to grow the business at a durable rate which we've shown over time we can do. And Naved, on the Websites + Marketing, e-commerce customers, I think that's the data point you were referencing. We did share today the Websites + Marketing had grown 20%, but the Commerce SKU had been growing 24%. So we continue to see more customers in -- and that was ARR number. So we continue to see more attention in the Commerce SKU. And as I've shared earlier, we're actually launching a higher-end Commerce SKU, and it's testing in the U.S. now. So in terms of that -- in terms of the overall business, Commerce is becoming a bigger part of our Websites + Marketing business. And Sunil, on the Apple announcement, again, I'll touch on this tomorrow, but we have a firm belief that the commerce use cases are going to appear on every surface that exists. And be tightly coupled to every product that's out there that where it makes sense. So I actually touch on it tomorrow a bit to share at GoDaddy, we believe that Commerce use cases are just going to be Omnipresent on everything we do. So no surprise that Apple is sort of bringing forward capability that allows folks to sort of tap in there just with the icon. Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to spending more time with you tomorrow at our Investor Day. And I'll just end by thanking all the GoDaddy employees all over the world for another great quarter and all the hard work they put in coming in every day with everything else going on. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman, and hello. I am looking forward to connecting with everyone over the next 2 days. Today, I'll first touch on 2021 full year and fourth quarter financial results as well as an outlook for 2022. Tomorrow, at our Investor Day, I'll provide additional long-term guidance and introduce our new revenue disclosures and metrics. With that, let's move to our 2021 results. Total revenue for 2021 grew 15% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, exceeding our initial guidance on broad-based strength in new and renewal revenue attach and outperformance in our aftermarket. ARPU increased 10% to 182, and we added 600,000 net new customers in 2021 with continued strong retention and renewal rates. Moving on to our quarterly results. GoDaddy achieved a new quarterly revenue milestone of $1 billion, up 17% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. International revenue grew 13% on a reported basis with approximately 1 point of currency tailwind. Q4 Domains revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $497 million. Aftermarket was the primary driver of the strength in Domains contributing nearly 2/3 of the growth in this line, with the remainder attributable to acceleration in GoDaddy Registry and continued strong new registrations and renewals. Hosting and Presence revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $330 million in the fourth quarter. We continued to drive growth in our Create and Grow products with legacy hosting and security growing low single digits.  Q4 Hosting and Presence, Create and Grow ARR surpassed $410 million, growing 19% year-over-year. Within that suite, Q4 Websites + Marketing ARR grew 20% year-over-year. And more specifically, Websites + Marketing Commerce ARR grew 24%, demonstrating our Commerce opportunity in Websites + Marketing. As Commerce becomes more pronounced in our products, we'll continue to evolve this disclosure as we have multiple paths of growth for Commerce and more products in our suite. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $26 billion in 2021, growing 21% year-over-year. Business Applications revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $192 million on continued strength in branded e-mail and productivity solutions as customers continue to attach add seats and up-level their solutions. Bookings grew to $1.1 billion, improving 11% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Growth was broad-based with continued strength across product categories, including strength in aftermarket. Gross margin was down slightly in the low end of the mid-60s for the quarter. Product mix, particularly strength in aftermarket, continues to drive the company's overall gross margin. Investment in tech and dev was consistent with last quarter as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation while maintaining fiscal discipline. We continue to get leverage in G&A as travel and other office expenses remain below historical levels. One item to note is that during Q4, we continued the consolidation of our Arizona offices, resulting in a closure of 1 office and a $15 million onetime charge in our restructuring and other line. This offset the $15 million gain recognized last quarter from the sale of another Arizona office as we continue to simplify our physical footprint. As Aman noted earlier, we drove efficiency in our marketing spend, although our investment remained strong in Q4 and consistent with Q3. Year-over-year saw a deceleration in our spend as we lapped the elevated investment we made in 2020 to capture the extraordinary demand. As we continue to refine our marketing return engine, we remain focused adjusting our marketing spend as macro environments fluctuate. Our growth and investment in the fourth quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $254 million, representing growth of 29% year-over-year from continued profitability, disciplined hiring and leveraging OpEx as we continue to benefit from work at home and decreased travel. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, growing 12% year-over-year. Full year unlevered free cash flow grew 16% year-over-year to $960 million, in line with our guidance. Positive working capital impacts as well as reduced capital expenditures for corporate real estate and infrastructure was offset by the lower margin profile of our top line outperformance. On the balance sheet, we exited the year with $1.3 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.9 billion. Net debt landed at $2.7 billion, below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4x. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model have fueled a strong balance sheet, enabling us to address our capital allocation priorities. In 2021, we completed 6 acquisitions and repurchased nearly 4% of our outstanding equity. In addition, today, we announced our intent to buy back $3 billion of shares through 2024. This represents utilization of approximately 80% of our projected free cash flow over the next 3 years and is expected to drive a material reduction in our share count. We also announced we expect to launch a $750 million ASR this quarter, which shows our commitment to aggressive use of the new $3 billion repurchase authorization. We are committed to increasing the value we create for shareholders by growing our free cash flow and reducing our share count over time. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for 2022. We expect total annual revenue to be within a range of $4.14 billion to $4.16 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint of the range. In Q1 2022, we are targeting total revenue of $985 million to $990 million. This represents 10% growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect 2022 unlevered free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion or 15% growth versus 2021. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, income tax payments of approximately $20 million and cash interest payments of approximately $120 million. The global pandemic has affected a lot of businesses in SMBs, the time line of which has varied by market, geography and customer type. Because of this variability forward-looking guidance based on years that were impacted or benefited by COVID can be challenging. As such, it's important to call out that guidance we're providing today shows continued business momentum. Yet comes off a strong year of outperformance in 2021, which makes for tough comps in the near term. Tomorrow at Investor Day, we will discuss multiyear growth targets and levers, which provide a better picture of the potential we see and the shareholder value it will create. We are committed to providing the information you need to model the business confidently, value the business effectively and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objectives. In addition to incremental disclosures and metrics, we will spend our time with you tomorrow discussing the company's long-term strategy, key innovation initiatives and updated capital allocation strategy and as I mentioned, a multiyear outlook. We'll end the day with Q&A hosted by our management team. Given we have Investor Day tomorrow, we ask that you limit questions today to our 2021 results and the information we've provided in our prepared remarks. We have ample information to share with you tomorrow, and we will have time to go into more details then. With that, I'll hand the call over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&A Thanks, Trevor, and good to see you. Good to hear from you. Just real quick on the outperformance in looking at aftermarket. We couldn't be more excited at the momentum we're seeing in the marketplace today around our aftermarket. As we exited the year, we saw an uptick in both volume and average deal size and we exited with deals that we're pacing at a great momentum. Just a reminder, it's a transactional business. So the sales cycle is short on those, so our visibility out in any period can be limited. But we're going to talk about it a little bit more tomorrow, but we couldn't be more excited at the momentum as we continue to see great demand in the market related to the platform. On Domains, we saw strength across the board. Customer retention rates remain strong. We also had added benefit from the Registry items that we noted. So when I look at it across the quarter, it's broad-based, clearly driven by aftermarket was the big pickup, but we saw strength across the board. Yes. Thanks, Aman. I'll ask it, we're going to talk a lot about segments tomorrow and some of our repositioning of our product pillars. So hang on tight with that question, if that's okay. I don't want to give away the lead story tomorrow. Having said that, on the upside, right, we couldn't have been more thrilled with the upside we saw in the market around aftermarket. And as I mentioned previously, it is a transactional business with a short sales cycle, and we're seeing great momentum in both volume and average deal size because it's transactional, it can provide some upside going forward. Now we don't have line of sight to that, and that's generally how we guide. But in answer to your question, we're excited about the upside there. Yes. And the great thing about our model and our durable revenue and our ability to generate cash is we can do so great attach, increasing ARPU and get better leverage because our business is sticky. And we continue to see that in marketing. We continue to see that in care. As our relationships grow, our ability to upsell and cross-sell, just get easier and we get better leverage out of it.  On top of that, we will continue to get leverage out of G&A. As we look to simplify our footprint, we're investing a lot in moving to the cloud. So again, the thing I love about our operating model is it flexible to agile and it creates a lot of leverage for us to both return cash to our shareholders as well as invest in durable growth. Yes. And I'll just add to that, Elizabeth, good to talk about again. Couldn't be more thrilled with the customer adds and the ARPU and the momentum. Really excited just showing the durability of the model and the strength of it going forward and the predictability of the revenue and the cash flow that we'll have into the future to invest and return to shareholders. Yes, absolutely. And I think we're comfortable with the guidance that we're giving out here. We've seen the Omicron hit in January with our care, like Aman mentioned. We think it's limited. Obviously, we can't predict any other variants or other things happening out there for the quarter. But I think we're very comfortable right now with where we're pegging Q1. Brent, perfect question, right? I would say we're going to get into the capital allocation strategy tomorrow. But one of the great things about our model, just leading up tomorrow is we have the ability to generate a lot of cash because of our predictability and bearability, but also look at other items that can accelerate growth and grow our business over the long term. So as I think I said in Q3, very much and versus an or for us and looking forward to getting the details of how we're thinking about that moving forward tomorrow. Yes. A couple of things. On -- just on the aftermarket part of it, and I'll try to bridge this from Q4 to Q1. It's a transactional business. So it impacts both bookings and revenue when it's recorded, but does not impact deferred revenue at the end of any given period. So it can provide upside in any given quarter, but does not have a what I'd call deferred revenue impact in future periods. So our visibility into any given quarter could provide variability. On the deferred revenue, I would say we're coming off of 2020 cohorts that were very large and we're coming into 2021 cohorts that are a little smaller. So we're seeing the deferred revenue balances come down based on that trend, but that's generally what you're seeing out there. So Deepak, I would say we're seeing great momentum in 2022 when it relates to continuing to grow our business and provide durable revenue. We are excited about the momentum of the aftermarket, but it's still early stage for us to see that momentum and the variability will have from quarter-to-quarter. We are extraordinarily excited at the volume of the transactions going up, the average deal size going up. So we expect some momentum. But like I said, it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Yes. I'll take the first part of that, and maybe Aman, you can take the second part of that, the inflationary comment. Obviously, we're living in interesting times with inflations, and we saw a lot in the press today. The fallback I always look at it is, hey, we have a very durable model that has been around for a while, and we've seen the ups and the downs, and we've been able to continue to generate growth, continue to move forward. So we'll see what the ultimate impact in the macro is around inflation, but we're confident that we continue to meet our strategic objectives going forward. Example I always used to use or like to use, I think in 2008, our cohort has generated $1.9 billion over the period of time, which is fantastic when you think about that looking back at what that type of macro environment was. So we believe our model remains durable. I'll take the first part of that. And Aman, maybe you take the second part of that. The gross margin this quarter was impacted by aftermarket. It's a lower gross margin point than some of our other products. So the outperformance impacted our gross margin. We still feel very confident in our operating margin and our ability to grow normalized EBITDA given the leverage that those models actually provide for us. But that is -- and the aftermarket did provide some downward pressure on our gross margin."

With me on the call today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics, such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, gross merchandise volume, or GMV, and net debt.

With that, here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy has made remarkable progress this quarter in our mission to make opportunity more inclusive for all, and we are incredibly excited about what the future holds for our company. We've continued accelerating our product innovation, maintained focus on gaining further customer traction. And in September, we celebrated what we consider to be the most significant product launch in our company's history. GoDaddy products are designed to serve various types of customers. We serve millions of independent entrepreneurs seeking to create and grow their business, both online and off-line. We serve the professional makers of the web who leverage our tools to build websites for their own clients, and we serve a growing body of domain investors who leverage the largest and most active domain aftermarket in the world. Today, I'd like to highlight a few of the most impactful initiatives for these customers and help this audience understand a little bit better why I have never been more excited to be leading this great company. Looking first at the macro environment, we track demand by monitoring a couple of key metrics, including search query volume. That is the number of potential customers searching online for products we sell as well as we look at gross customer adds in any given period. We are pleased that some of the uneven demand signals seen over the summer did not prevent us from delivering strong results in Q3. Relative to the demand signals we were seeing in July, we are starting to feel better as normal seasonality appears to be returning to the business. We are still hyperfocused on delivering customer value, unlocking new TAM and increasing new revenue streams, all while generating strong durable cash flow. We have exciting updates to the three priorities we laid out to you in 2021: first, driving success in commerce through presence; second, winning with GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating new Domains. As you heard me say consistently this year, driving success in commerce through presence is our top priority for 2021, and we took a giant leap forward in Q3. As many of you saw, we had a huge product launch in September. With the introduction of off-line hardware solutions to complement our online solutions, we now have all tools in place for our OmniCommerce offering. We introduced our OmniCommerce offerings for Websites + Marketing, giving our customers the tools they need to sell anything anywhere. We have exciting plans for OmniCommerce beyond Websites + Marketing and look forward to sharing those updates with you soon. We've said that 2021 would be about building the products and getting them out by the end of this year and that 2022 would be about experimentation with pricing, go-to-market strategies, bundling, new SKUs and promotions. One of the best things about getting the products launched three months early is that we get to start the experimentation earlier, too. We have already begun exploring options for bundles, new SKUs and go-to-market strategies to make OmniCommerce the easiest and simplest way for a merchant to set up an omnichannel commerce venture. Our OmniCommerce solutions give small businesses the ability to sell, track and manage their sales in more places than any other comparable platform. In September, we launched state-of-the-art point-of-sale devices, Smart Terminal and Card Reader, that communicate across systems, spanning online, off-line and third-party platforms. The point-of-sale launch rounds out the GoDaddy Payments and commerce package comprised of e-commerce, Virtual Terminal, Online Pay Links and now off-line transactions as well. Customers were thrilled to see GoDaddy's commitment to their success when we introduced industry-leading pricing in our terminals and payment transaction fees. We believe GoDaddy is the most merchant-friendly commerce solutions vendor in the industry right now. We wanted to make these stunning, innovative and feature-rich point-of-sale devices accessible to the greatest number of potential merchants, and our pricing reflects that priority. These devices work with our Websites + Marketing solutions as well as the WooCommerce and WordPress platform, furthering our commitment to seamlessly intuitive experiences GoDaddy customers can configure these devices online before they arrive, including adding product listings, logo and custom receipts. So the device is ready for transactions as soon as it arrives, two days later with free shipping. And we are allowing our customers to keep more of each dollar they earn. We introduced the lowest effective payments pricing available in the U.S. GoDaddy will charge an in-person transaction fee of 2.3% plus $0.00, while online transactions will be charged 2.3% plus $0.30. On average, a customer would save over 20% with GoDaddy Payments on transaction fees for online and in-person when compared to other leading providers transaction fees. GoDaddy customers continue to grow their online and off-line businesses. In Q3, annualized GMV across GoDaddy products increased nearly 30% year-over-year to approximately $25 billion. Poynt continues to account for the majority, roughly $20 billion, and Sellbrite and Websites + Marketing, both continue to grow year-over-year even with 2020's tough comps. We're also pleased to share that across our Create and Grow products, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios, ARR surpassed $400 million, growing 17% year-over-year. To help our customers navigate and grow their business, we launched the Commerce Hub. The Commerce Hub is designed to help customers easily manage and track every sale online, off-line or both. Similar to our GoDaddy Pro Hub, the Commerce Hub includes an intuitive dashboard that provides bird's-eye view metrics on business performance, including visualizations, mapping sales and orders, comparison tools to help entrepreneurs see which channels are performing best, single sign-on capabilities and access to inventory tracking tools. We introduced all of this innovation at our virtual OPEN 2021 event in September with our partner, Naomi Osaka, who launched her own brand of skincare products with GoDaddy as the official e-commerce partner. OPEN 2021 included breakout sessions for our customers to learn more about branding, marketing and sales growth and to help them network with other entrepreneurs. More than 20,000 people attended the virtual event, materially surpassing the turnout we saw last year even in the midst of the pandemic-driven digitization of small business. As you can see, we have an ambitious view of what we can accomplish in Commerce and Presence, and we're just getting started. We're excited to show you more of what our products can do and share more of what we plan to accomplish with those products at our Investor Day in a few short months. Moving on to Pros. We know that designers and developers prefer WordPress, and GoDaddy remains the global champion of WordPress, serving Pros with both our legacy hosting and our Managed WordPress solutions. Earlier this year, we shared details of the Pro Hub launch, and we set out an ambitious goal of bringing 300,000 new and current GoDaddy Pros into the Pro Hub by the end of the year. We are on track to reach this goal. The powerful functionality of the Pro Hub simplifies Pros' work and serves as another example of GoDaddy delivering on our commitment to increase value to our customers now. The first step now well underway is getting Pros in and engaged with the Pro Hub so they can see firsthand how much easier it makes their professional life. The second step, which is yet to come, is to find ways to share economics and capture more wallet share among those Pros in a way that makes them more successful as well. This quarter, we launched simple Invoicing and Payments solutions for Pros available within the Pro Hub, eliminating the need for Pros to track and manage yet another third-party point solution. This was a major pain point for GoDaddy Pros. Invoicing and Payment's functionality was the most requested feature in our Pro ecosystem. We were happy to deliver and almost immediately, we saw good adoption. Lastly, we continued facilitating and harnessing the exponential power of the GoDaddy community, hosting our first GoDaddy event in India, specifically for Pros. As you recall, we held the GoDaddy Expand event in April for designers, developers and agency pros in the United States. In September, we expanded this event, hosting another country-specific GoDaddy Expand event in India. We were humbled to see thousands of Pros registered for the event, giving us a forum to help them. Customer feedback from the Expand event in India was very positive, summed up well by one customer who said I was blown away by the professional selection of topics and presenters. Moving on to Domains. This business has been fantastic for GoDaddy this past year, and it continues to outperform the industry by a large margin. As we have been sharing throughout the year, our teams continue to innovate in all areas, primary registrations, the Domains aftermarket and GoDaddy Registry, driving fantastic revenue growth. Aftermarket continues to drive significant year-over-year growth as we still benefit from the list of sale tools introduced in Q4 of last year. On Registry, we are continuing to prove our ability to acquire, integrate and accelerate. A great example is the cohort performance within GoDaddy Registry. When we acquired Neustar's Registry assets in Q3 last year, its new cohorts were shrinking with new unit registrations down 4% year-over-year. We are now 1 year into the acquisition, and we're pleased to report that within that first year, we have been able to accelerate new business significantly. We are now seeing new unit registrations increased nearly 20% year-over-year, all organically. There is still significant room for innovation and improvement in both the Registry and Registrar sites of our domain business, and we have several exciting initiatives in the works. We're excited to share more about what we're cooking up in Domains at our Investor Day. Before I finish up, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our upcoming Investor Day in February, announced a few weeks ago. We wanted to give people a heads up that it was coming because we expect to share some really exciting things. We expect to discuss our long-term strategy, innovation initiatives, financial framework, capital allocation strategy and go-forward financial reporting structure. We look forward to engaging with you to get your thoughts and feedback as we prepare for this event. In closing, we're quite happy with the results this quarter and GoDaddy's ability to pursue enormous opportunities ahead. We are well positioned as a true global leader with increasing customer touch points and ability to provide essential technology solutions. GoDaddy at its core is a great business that has and will continue to generate predictable results with an attractive financial profile, profitable growth at scale and durable cash flow. Importantly, we'll maintain a relentless focus on increasing shareholder value and have demonstrated the capability to invest capital prudently. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, bringing important new solutions to customers, driving progress across the entire industry and continuing to drive the value creation flywheel. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. I want to take a moment to discuss our financial results for the third quarter and then move to our financial outlook for the rest of 2021. Q3 was a strong quarter, which showed up in the financial results. Total revenue came in at $964 million, growing over 14% year-over-year, which includes 70 basis points of currency tailwind. Our international business grew at 13% on a reported basis, with approximately two points of currency tailwind. As an [Technical Difficulty] trends in the top of the funnel signals continue to be below the elevated demand we saw last year, but in line with 2019. Hosting and Presence grew 7% year-over-year, delivering at the high end of our expectations for mid-single-digit growth. We continue to see nice growth in our Presence products like Websites + Marketing, tempered by slower growth in our legacy hosting and security business. And while it's still too early to provide any details, we are really pleased with what we are seeing so far from our OmniCommerce launch in September as well as the uptake we're seeing from the GoDaddy Payments more broadly. Within Hosting and Presence, we're pleased to share an update to the previously disclosed ARR metric from our Create and Grow group of products, which includes Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios. The suite of products passed $400 million in ARR in Q3. Within that suite, ARR from Websites + Marketing grew more than 20% year-over-year in Q3, and more specifically, Websites + Marketing commerce ARR grew more than 30% year-over-year in Q3. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $25 billion, growing nearly 30% year-over-year. We saw growth across all channels, primarily driven by off-line point-of-sale as we lap online tailwinds from COVID. Domains grew 17% year-over-year. The innovation the teams put in place late last year is driving performance in the aftermarket, which was a large contributor to the growth we saw in the third quarter. We also continue to see consistent renewals and comp primary registrations. And finally, Business Applications was our fastest-growing product line, increasing 20% year-over-year. We continue to see new customer attach, strong renewals and existing customers adding additional seats of e-mail and productivity solutions. Bookings came in at $1.04 billion, rising 10% year-over-year, with 80 basis points of currency tailwind. Strength in bookings in the quarter reflect similar drivers to what we called out for revenue. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter, in line with what we saw both last quarter and the mid-60 range we've guided to. Product mix continues to drive the company's overall gross margin. Given the Payments launch and the pricing we announced in September, we expect Payments revenue to have two different margin impacts as it scales. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as the revenue stream gets larger in the coming quarters and years. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments. So we expect Payments to be highly accretive to normalized EBITDA over time. Investment in tech and dev was consistent with last quarter as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation while maintaining fiscal discipline. We continue to get leverage in G&A as travel and other office expenses remain below historical levels. Consistent with last quarter, our marketing and advertising investment remained strong in Q3, though the year-over-year growth decelerated as we started to lap the elevated investment we made to capture the extraordinary demand we saw last year. Our growth and investment in the second quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $228 million, representing growth of 15% year-over-year. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $252 million, growing 12% year-over-year, driven by strong profitability, continued positive impacts from working capital and disciplined CapEx investment as we continue shifting workloads to the cloud. We note, however, due to the global supply chain issues impacting technology hardware like servers, some of our planned CapEx spending shifted into Q4. We expect to continue our CapEx investment in Q4, bringing unlevered free cash flow in line with our full year guide. Now on to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We finished Q2 with $1.1 billion in cash and total liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt stands at $2.8 billion below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2x to 4x. GoDaddy has a strong liquidity position, access to both debt and equity capital markets and resilient cash-generating operations. During the third quarter, we executed an accelerated share repurchase buying 3.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. We also allocated nearly $200 million to acquisitions in the Registry space. As we think about capital priorities, we will continue to balance M&A and share repurchases to make sure capital is deployed in the way that we believe will generate the best long-term returns for shareholders. After the completion of the ASR mentioned above, we have approximately $750 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. Moving on to our outlook. GoDaddy is on track to outperform the initial revenue and unlevered free cash flow targets we laid out at the beginning of the year. Looking at Q4, we expect total revenue of approximately $970 million or 11% growth year-over-year. Based on our outperformance in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're raising our full year revenue guidance to approximately $3.765 billion, a 14% growth year-over-year. As I noted earlier, some of our CapEx spending has shifted from Q3 to Q4. Based on our continued plan for approximately $60 million in CapEx spending for the full year and the strong performance we've seen year-to-date, we're raising the unlevered free cash flow guidance to $960 million or 16% growth year-over-year. As we mentioned last quarter, we still expect bookings growth to be a couple of points below revenue growth in the final quarter of the year as FX tailwinds continue to abate and we face the tough compares from Q4 of last year. In Q4, we expect Domains revenue to grow low double digits as we lap the tougher compares in the aftermarket from the impact of our list for sale tool and the other improvements introduced in Q4 last year that we talked about last quarter. The aftermarket, as you know, is a non-subscription business, therefore, it does not impact our deferred revenue at the end of the period. We expect Hosting and Presence revenue to deliver mid-single-digit growth for the full year. We continue to see low single-digit growth in our legacy hosting business. We're also lapping very difficult comps in our higher growth products like Websites + Marketing and the top of the funnel softness we saw over the summer will take some time to rebuild, even with the improvements seen in September and October. We've got a strong track record of driving growth. And with an impressive slate of new offerings coming to market, we remain optimistic that we will be able to accelerate the growth of Hosting and Presence next year. We continue to expect high-teens growth in Business Applications for the full year, driven by customer attach, seek growth among existing customers and upgrades to higher-priced tiers of productivity solutions. With respect to investments and expenses, we'll continue investing in the tech and dev as we work to maintain the product momentum we've seen year-to-date. Based on the current demand environment, we're expecting our absolute marketing spend to be relatively flat sequentially in Q4. We continue to expect investments to be largely offset by continued leverage in customer care and G&A. We are still comfortable with the 4-1-1 targets we set out early last year, and we'll provide more specific formal guidance in February. Some of the revenue streams that we expect to become more impactful over time like Payments in aftermarket are recognized immediately. So we would expect bookings growth and revenue growth to converge over time. GoDaddy has an incredibly bright road ahead and is well equipped with both the innovation and the financial resources needed to pursue and capture the immense opportunity before us. Our consistent cash generation gives us multiple levers to generate significant returns for our shareholders, and we're committed to doing just that. As we prepare for our Investor Day in February, I'm excited about the direction of the company, our strategic vision and the plans we are putting in place to enhance investor communication and outreach. GoDaddy is committed to providing investors with the information they need each quarter to model their business confidently, value the business effectively and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objective. It's going to be an exciting day, and we look forward to being with all of you then. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Okay, good afternoon, guys. I guess I'll start at the highest level. And just trying to understand, you had some good solid outperformance across the board in 3Q. You talked about customer softness at last earnings, it was kind of the peak of the summer and vacations and the shift to travel and entertainment and all that. Can you talk about how the customer trends have evolved since then? Why -- and why the outperformance in light of those headwinds, I feel like they were the strongest over the summer, aren't translating into your guidance on 4Q?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Ygal. I can take that. Obviously, we're very happy that our strong execution enabled us to deliver strong results in Q3. Even though as we shared with you, there was sort of the uneven demand signals that we were seeing over the summer. To answer your question and give you a little bit of sort of chronological view on it, we saw the drop most in July. There was a stabilization in August and then improved a bit in September, and October is working out in line with September. So we're still continuing to monitor, but we're cautiously optimistic about normal seasonality returning to the business, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance. We would like to share with you exactly what we see, which we did last time, and we're looking to do that again this time.\nYgal Arounian: Okay, thanks. I'll ask about the Neustar and the cohort growth there. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color on what exactly is happening there that is turning the business around from pre-M&A to post M&A? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, super excited and proud of the team. The GoDaddy Registry team is come into GoDaddy. They've had to go through the integration. We're growing scale for them, as you know, and we have new businesses to integrate with them. But all through it, they have maintained really strong execution. So it's really about good strong execution, the team coming together, it's a small team, but they've done a fantastic job. And of course, as much as we can, we have the ability of that team working with GoDaddy leaders and looking for opportunities and looking for brands. And as I've shared in the past, we'll continue to share with you specific innovations that come forward, but this one is just execution, right?\nYgal Arounian: Great, thanks so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello. Great to see another quarter of strong results ahead of guidance. I wanted to understand what the expectations are for durable growth in the Create and Grow products? I know as we are exiting tough compares and some of that top of funnel softness you called out, I just want to understand what kind of growth rate you would orient us to looking beyond 2021? And maybe even if not talking about beyond 2021, could you help us maybe understand some historical context to what that segment was growing sort of pre-pandemic?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Clarke. And I'll take the first part of it and then maybe hand it to Aman for the historical part. We're seeing positive signs in our Create and Grow, and we are really happy with the ARR around Websites + Marketing with 20% and Websites + Marketing commerce at 30%. Acknowledging the softness and looking at Q4, that funnel slowdown will take a little bit of time to rebuild like we said in our comments, but we're really optimistic on the positive signs. As we also said, we're comfortable with the 4-1-1 moving forward, and we are really looking forward to catching up with one everybody on Investor Day and kind of putting it all together so we can communicate to you.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. And then now with the OmniCommerce solution out in market, I just wanted to understand what allowed you to release industry-leading pricing on POS transactions, 2.3 plus 30. What gives you the flexibility to grant this kind of pricing compared to peers?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I'm happy to start there. The real build here is to look at it from the ground up and say, what do our customers need to make these products accessible for them? And we broke down the pricing structure, and it's about technology and innovation. And as you know, we have a fantastic team from Poynt. And our goal is to not lose any money in payments or in hardware. Our goal is to build it up from the bottom, innovate, pass on the value to the customer. And I'm excited about the idea that customers look at this pricing and they adopt and that we see a lot of demand for our products.\nClarke Jeffries: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead.\nNicholas Jones: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just on the Domains business, are you seeing any success kind of tilting Domain shoppers towards the TLDs that you own as opposed to maybe dotcom, which I think is generally more popular? And then the second question is, can you remind us how the Verisign kind of dotcom price increases will trickle through? I think it's likely to become a bigger impact next year as it flows through dot coms I think people are expecting to take another price increase sometime next year? So those are the two questions. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Nick. On the giving preferential treatment to certain TLDs that we may own, we don't do that. All TLDs work on our registrar side in terms of their merit. It's about value to the customer whatever works best irrespective of whether we own the registry side or not. That's what we'll sell in front of the customer. We do -- to your question on Verisign price increases, as you well know, I think we -- our pricing is quite nuanced. We have pricing that's different by customer populations. We have pricing that's different by geography. We're pricing that differs when we bundle as an example. So we are always experimenting with pricing. We're always looking to optimize. And we realize that as GoDaddy, we have an opportunity to truly look at our options. And if it makes sense, and as you know, over time, registrars have passed Registry price increases to the customer. We have the option to do that. But we also have the option to not pass the price and look for opportunity to really optimize for profit dollars. And I'll turn it to Mark and maybe Mark, if you have something to add on that.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Aman. One, just to enforce pricing for -- pricing wasn't an impact on Q3 for us, just as an FYI. When we do look at pricing, we are solving for gross profit. But if it comes to market share versus gross profit, we will go with market share. And we do not use any type of broad brush approach to pricing increases. We really look at it on a market-by-market basis.\nNicholas Jones: Got it. And maybe if I could just follow up on the first question and maybe say it a different way. I think you've given a statistic that like 50% of people searching for a domain don't kind of find the handle they're looking for right away. So they may be tilted more towards the dotcom or are you able to kind of present more options with the handle they want that maybe ends up yielding more purchases and TLDs that you own. I guess I don't know if that kind of helps clarify where I was going with it next.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Nick, just to quickly respond to that, you're right. A lot of customers don't get the dotcom they're looking for because it's already taken, pizza.com, somebody's already got it. What we do is we're improving our search results more and more, where we use machine learning and AI to give the customer options, and those options include TLDs. And it's actually very specific to the search. So it's really not about what TLDs we might own. It's really about what the search is and then providing the customers high up on search as it makes sense with those options with different TLDs and letting the customer make the choice.\nNicholas Jones: Great, thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And I'll just add to that, Aman. Aftermarket does help us present to them names that they might not be able to get otherwise. So it is driving some of our aftermarket growth as well.\nNicholas Jones: Great, thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Great, thanks. As it just relates to the seasonality, I'm curious, it seems like to me -- you mentioned there's a rebound. I'm curious kind of when you think about the trajectory of this rebound? And can you may be put in context the -- historically what you're hearing from that side? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nAman Bhutani: Sure, Brent. There a couple of data points here. We're looking at overall demand, sort of Google Search traffic as an example. And we're looking at how that's changing and evolving. And obviously, I know you have access to that data, too. But we parse it and we say, okay, is there a shift in the overall universe. And then we're looking at folks coming to our site, the gross customer ad and saying, okay, what percentage of that population is actually becoming customers for GoDaddy or approaching GoDaddy. So what do you see in the guide, the assumptions in it are around what we see over the last four, five months, and we see signals match up in the broader macro with our data. In terms of answering your question on what do we -- how does it compare to the past? Obviously, 2020 was a very large demand cycle, it was big cohorts and so on. So what we're really comparing against is 2019, and these demand signals are more in line with 2019 than 2020.\nBrent Thill: Okay. That's great. And just a quick follow-up on the financials. I mean, the delta between bookings and revenue, and I know there's a lot of factors, but it's never, I think, been this wide at 9% FX versus 13.5% on -- so what is the divergence? Why is it so large? And I know you mentioned they're going to converge. But why are we seeing that right now?\nMark McCaffrey: I kind of look at it as a cycle. We are -- we saw a divergence. Now we're seeing a convergence come back the other way. And we do, like you said, expect them to equal out over time, and we're starting to see that happen now. But we had large cohorts last year. They went into our deferred revenue. They're being amortized out now. And as they're being replaced by smaller cohorts, it's going to result in that divergence you're seeing right now.\nBrent Thill: Great, thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Elliott from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\nElizabeth Elliott: Hi, thank you so much for questions. So I'll try to dig in a little bit on Payments and super helpful color on about 20% savings on fees versus other providers. Any color you could share with us and kind of the mix of new eligible users? How many of those are opting for GoDaddy Payments?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Elizabeth. It's really too early to talk about new versus existing users. As you know, we did a big launch called OPEN 21 and attracted a lot of customers, 20,000 folks plus got to see it. We have thousands of folks engaged in detailed sessions where we talked about how to do their marketing, how to sort of manage their off-line and online portfolios and get into the big markets and platforms. So -- but it's all very, very early. And unfortunately, it's too early to comment on any specific numbers.\nElizabeth Elliott: Got it, thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Elizabeth, I'll just add what we're seeing. We're really excited about it. And the great thing about launching a quarter early is we'll get to see data a quarter early. So we're really looking forward to adding some color on the Investor Day.\nElizabeth Elliott: Great. And then just a quick follow-up for me on the Pro Hub. It's great to see kind of you're on track for that ambitious 300,000 goal on Pros. I know that the Hub itself is free. So any color you could provide on just the ability to grow the mix of Pros and attach kind of more products to those users in order to monetize the opportunity?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. As you know, we have 1.5 million web Pros on our platform. Given the businesses we're in, we have access to a lot of these Pros. But we built the Hub so we could have engagement with them on a regular basis, give them ways to save them time, giving them ways to be able to do their jobs better and focus on growing customers and their business. The Pros focus on WordPress, that's what the hub is all about optimizing their experience there. And ultimately, what we're looking for is to get a bigger share of wallet with GoDaddy forum. We know Pros support lots of multi-sites. They have a percentage with us, and we know it's a very, very large opportunity for us to get a piece of the rest. Other places that where you'll see some monetization experiments, of course, we launched Invoicing. So that's a good tool. It creates lots of stickiness, but it also creates some economics. We're also experimenting with special offers within the Hub. So where we can try to see what encourages Pros to sort of buy something with GoDaddy versus something else. And just it's -- the idea there is let's try to share with them and say, hey, if you sell this product, we'll give you a piece of it. Those are the types of experiments you'll see, and those also create economics for us.\nElizabeth Elliott: Great, thank you very much for color.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So I'm curious if you could give us some color geographically on the trends that you talked about. So in other words, the sluggishness that's turning into improving signs back to 2019, how does that look in the U.S. versus Europe versus Brazil, et cetera?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Sterling. It truly follows sort of the COVID arc that we've talked about in the past and likely UC as well. The demand environment that I talked about actually covered U.S. and international and we see a lot of similarities. Having said that, in certain geos, there is a bigger impact from COVID, and we see demand bounce around a little bit in those geos. But overall, in the GoDaddy portfolio, that's small. So if I look at the overall portfolio, there isn't really 1 geo to specifically call out as having any significant impact. And broadly, the trends are similar.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. And then one follow-up on the Payments side. You mentioned being given the opportunity to experiment with pricing. So is that to mean that the lowest pricing that you just announced is something that's kind of a test bed and could fluctuate? Or what is it that you want to experiment with?\nAman Bhutani: Sterling, the pricing that we announced, the 2.3% plus $0.00 in-store and 2.3% plus $0.30 online, that's the pricing for Payments. But as you know, we have a lot of opportunity to build SKUs and bundles, including new value for these. So the experimentation that we'll be looking at is new SKUs that offer the full suite where customers get the force bang, if you will, and how do we price those things when we bundle things differently, the pricing for the hardware, those are the areas that you'll see us experiment more.\nSterling Auty: Excellent, thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young : Well, I think we might have lost Trevor. So Naved, if you are available, Naved Khan from Truist, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thank you. Can you hear me okay?\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nNaved Khan: Great. So with $20 billion in GMV kind of going through Poynt, maybe can you just touch on the opportunity to maybe gradually maybe move over some of this on your own rails GoDaddy Payments versus the legacy? And what are the things you can -- what are the different levers you can pull to do that?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Naved. As you know, Poynt built its customer base, predominantly through channel partners, and those channel partners have banks want to use their rails for payments. But what that GMV does show is customer success. That customers at a very large scale are having a lot of success using this tool set. And obviously, our thesis of having Poynt be a part of GoDaddy is about us selling direct to customers, right? So I would look at that $20 billion as customer success and over time, more and more GPV flowing directly as we sell directly to customers.\nNaved Khan: Got it. And then a quick follow-up, if I may. If I just look at marketing efficiency, it seems like it improved sequentially. Any changes that you might have made to a channel mix? Or how should we just kind of think about this going forward?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Overall, we are happy with the returns on our marketing spend. And what you're really seeing here is over the last year, as demand was very high, we wanted to maintain share of voice. We wanted to lean into that demand. And as the demand came down, we didn't want to pull back on marketing so hard that we actually pull demand down for ourselves. So we let the demand pull the marketing spend down. You're seeing some of that in the efficiency. You're also seeing some optimizations across channels, but no specific comment on channels that we're doing more on or less on. Overall, our demand profile, especially in the way we get bookings broadly remains the same.\nMark McCaffrey: I'll add to that, Naved. We expect it to be flat for Q4, just in case we're asking that question as well.\nNaved Khan: That's helpful.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great, thanks. Just two, if I may, on Payments. First acknowledging that it's kind of early days, can you talk about the initial adoption on Payments, feedback on the POS devices? What seems to be resonating well with merchants versus maybe what needs some refinement? And then Mark, your comments were helpful on the margin profile. It sounds like maybe lower gross margin, but higher overall OMs over time. But can you help us unpack the fees there, like in terms of interchange fees, fraud and security, other cost of revenue lines and then OpEx and opportunities for savings there as it scales? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Trevor. On Payments, the feedback on the products has been positive. One thing I talked about previously, if you remember, we had introduced just GoDaddy Payments. I'm not talking about Omnicommerce, GoDaddy Payments in the Websites + Marketing flow. And we had shared that we've seen good adoption from customers on Payments. We continue to see good adoption there. So we know that it's been holding over the last few months. And in terms of other numbers related to OmniCommerce, the devices are getting shipped all over the U.S. So you'll see them soon. But it's really too early to comment on specifics, except that the customer feedback is good.\nMark McCaffrey: And Trevor, I'll just add, without getting into the breakdown of some of that pricing. Just a couple of data points. One, we don't plan to lose money on the hardware and the payments. And our expectation, although we'll see a little bit of margin pressure at the gross level, it should be accretive to our normalized EBITDA going forward.\nTrevor Young: Great, thank you, guys.\nChristie Masoner: Thank you for joining us today. I will turn it over to Aman for closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. I'll just end with thanking you for joining. We appreciate your questions. I look forward to engaging with you over time and seeing you at our Investor Day in February. A quick thank you to all the GoDaddy teams. A lot goes on for us to be able to deliver these strong results in the quarter, and a big thank you to everyone at GoDaddy. Thank you very much.",

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy has made remarkable progress this quarter in our mission to make opportunity more inclusive for all, and we are incredibly excited about what the future holds for our company. We've continued accelerating our product innovation, maintained focus on gaining further customer traction. And in September, we celebrated what we consider to be the most significant product launch in our company's history. GoDaddy products are designed to serve various types of customers. We serve millions of independent entrepreneurs seeking to create and grow their business, both online and off-line. We serve the professional makers of the web who leverage our tools to build websites for their own clients, and we serve a growing body of domain investors who leverage the largest and most active domain aftermarket in the world. Today, I'd like to highlight a few of the most impactful initiatives for these customers and help this audience understand a little bit better why I have never been more excited to be leading this great company. Looking first at the macro environment, we track demand by monitoring a couple of key metrics, including search query volume. That is the number of potential customers searching online for products we sell as well as we look at gross customer adds in any given period. We are pleased that some of the uneven demand signals seen over the summer did not prevent us from delivering strong results in Q3. Relative to the demand signals we were seeing in July, we are starting to feel better as normal seasonality appears to be returning to the business. We are still hyperfocused on delivering customer value, unlocking new TAM and increasing new revenue streams, all while generating strong durable cash flow. We have exciting updates to the three priorities we laid out to you in 2021: first, driving success in commerce through presence; second, winning with GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating new Domains. As you heard me say consistently this year, driving success in commerce through presence is our top priority for 2021, and we took a giant leap forward in Q3. As many of you saw, we had a huge product launch in September. With the introduction of off-line hardware solutions to complement our online solutions, we now have all tools in place for our OmniCommerce offering. We introduced our OmniCommerce offerings for Websites + Marketing, giving our customers the tools they need to sell anything anywhere. We have exciting plans for OmniCommerce beyond Websites + Marketing and look forward to sharing those updates with you soon. We've said that 2021 would be about building the products and getting them out by the end of this year and that 2022 would be about experimentation with pricing, go-to-market strategies, bundling, new SKUs and promotions. One of the best things about getting the products launched three months early is that we get to start the experimentation earlier, too. We have already begun exploring options for bundles, new SKUs and go-to-market strategies to make OmniCommerce the easiest and simplest way for a merchant to set up an omnichannel commerce venture. Our OmniCommerce solutions give small businesses the ability to sell, track and manage their sales in more places than any other comparable platform. In September, we launched state-of-the-art point-of-sale devices, Smart Terminal and Card Reader, that communicate across systems, spanning online, off-line and third-party platforms. The point-of-sale launch rounds out the GoDaddy Payments and commerce package comprised of e-commerce, Virtual Terminal, Online Pay Links and now off-line transactions as well. Customers were thrilled to see GoDaddy's commitment to their success when we introduced industry-leading pricing in our terminals and payment transaction fees. We believe GoDaddy is the most merchant-friendly commerce solutions vendor in the industry right now. We wanted to make these stunning, innovative and feature-rich point-of-sale devices accessible to the greatest number of potential merchants, and our pricing reflects that priority. These devices work with our Websites + Marketing solutions as well as the WooCommerce and WordPress platform, furthering our commitment to seamlessly intuitive experiences GoDaddy customers can configure these devices online before they arrive, including adding product listings, logo and custom receipts. So the device is ready for transactions as soon as it arrives, two days later with free shipping. And we are allowing our customers to keep more of each dollar they earn. We introduced the lowest effective payments pricing available in the U.S. GoDaddy will charge an in-person transaction fee of 2.3% plus $0.00, while online transactions will be charged 2.3% plus $0.30. On average, a customer would save over 20% with GoDaddy Payments on transaction fees for online and in-person when compared to other leading providers transaction fees. GoDaddy customers continue to grow their online and off-line businesses. In Q3, annualized GMV across GoDaddy products increased nearly 30% year-over-year to approximately $25 billion. Poynt continues to account for the majority, roughly $20 billion, and Sellbrite and Websites + Marketing, both continue to grow year-over-year even with 2020's tough comps. We're also pleased to share that across our Create and Grow products, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios, ARR surpassed $400 million, growing 17% year-over-year. To help our customers navigate and grow their business, we launched the Commerce Hub. The Commerce Hub is designed to help customers easily manage and track every sale online, off-line or both. Similar to our GoDaddy Pro Hub, the Commerce Hub includes an intuitive dashboard that provides bird's-eye view metrics on business performance, including visualizations, mapping sales and orders, comparison tools to help entrepreneurs see which channels are performing best, single sign-on capabilities and access to inventory tracking tools. We introduced all of this innovation at our virtual OPEN 2021 event in September with our partner, Naomi Osaka, who launched her own brand of skincare products with GoDaddy as the official e-commerce partner. OPEN 2021 included breakout sessions for our customers to learn more about branding, marketing and sales growth and to help them network with other entrepreneurs. More than 20,000 people attended the virtual event, materially surpassing the turnout we saw last year even in the midst of the pandemic-driven digitization of small business. As you can see, we have an ambitious view of what we can accomplish in Commerce and Presence, and we're just getting started. We're excited to show you more of what our products can do and share more of what we plan to accomplish with those products at our Investor Day in a few short months. Moving on to Pros. We know that designers and developers prefer WordPress, and GoDaddy remains the global champion of WordPress, serving Pros with both our legacy hosting and our Managed WordPress solutions. Earlier this year, we shared details of the Pro Hub launch, and we set out an ambitious goal of bringing 300,000 new and current GoDaddy Pros into the Pro Hub by the end of the year. We are on track to reach this goal. The powerful functionality of the Pro Hub simplifies Pros' work and serves as another example of GoDaddy delivering on our commitment to increase value to our customers now. The first step now well underway is getting Pros in and engaged with the Pro Hub so they can see firsthand how much easier it makes their professional life. The second step, which is yet to come, is to find ways to share economics and capture more wallet share among those Pros in a way that makes them more successful as well. This quarter, we launched simple Invoicing and Payments solutions for Pros available within the Pro Hub, eliminating the need for Pros to track and manage yet another third-party point solution. This was a major pain point for GoDaddy Pros. Invoicing and Payment's functionality was the most requested feature in our Pro ecosystem. We were happy to deliver and almost immediately, we saw good adoption. Lastly, we continued facilitating and harnessing the exponential power of the GoDaddy community, hosting our first GoDaddy event in India, specifically for Pros. As you recall, we held the GoDaddy Expand event in April for designers, developers and agency pros in the United States. In September, we expanded this event, hosting another country-specific GoDaddy Expand event in India. We were humbled to see thousands of Pros registered for the event, giving us a forum to help them. Customer feedback from the Expand event in India was very positive, summed up well by one customer who said I was blown away by the professional selection of topics and presenters. Moving on to Domains. This business has been fantastic for GoDaddy this past year, and it continues to outperform the industry by a large margin. As we have been sharing throughout the year, our teams continue to innovate in all areas, primary registrations, the Domains aftermarket and GoDaddy Registry, driving fantastic revenue growth. Aftermarket continues to drive significant year-over-year growth as we still benefit from the list of sale tools introduced in Q4 of last year. On Registry, we are continuing to prove our ability to acquire, integrate and accelerate. A great example is the cohort performance within GoDaddy Registry. When we acquired Neustar's Registry assets in Q3 last year, its new cohorts were shrinking with new unit registrations down 4% year-over-year. We are now 1 year into the acquisition, and we're pleased to report that within that first year, we have been able to accelerate new business significantly. We are now seeing new unit registrations increased nearly 20% year-over-year, all organically. There is still significant room for innovation and improvement in both the Registry and Registrar sites of our domain business, and we have several exciting initiatives in the works. We're excited to share more about what we're cooking up in Domains at our Investor Day. Before I finish up, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our upcoming Investor Day in February, announced a few weeks ago. We wanted to give people a heads up that it was coming because we expect to share some really exciting things. We expect to discuss our long-term strategy, innovation initiatives, financial framework, capital allocation strategy and go-forward financial reporting structure. We look forward to engaging with you to get your thoughts and feedback as we prepare for this event. In closing, we're quite happy with the results this quarter and GoDaddy's ability to pursue enormous opportunities ahead. We are well positioned as a true global leader with increasing customer touch points and ability to provide essential technology solutions. GoDaddy at its core is a great business that has and will continue to generate predictable results with an attractive financial profile, profitable growth at scale and durable cash flow. Importantly, we'll maintain a relentless focus on increasing shareholder value and have demonstrated the capability to invest capital prudently. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, bringing important new solutions to customers, driving progress across the entire industry and continuing to drive the value creation flywheel. With that, here's Mark. Thanks, Ygal. I can take that. Obviously, we're very happy that our strong execution enabled us to deliver strong results in Q3. Even though as we shared with you, there was sort of the uneven demand signals that we were seeing over the summer. To answer your question and give you a little bit of sort of chronological view on it, we saw the drop most in July. There was a stabilization in August and then improved a bit in September, and October is working out in line with September. So we're still continuing to monitor, but we're cautiously optimistic about normal seasonality returning to the business, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance. We would like to share with you exactly what we see, which we did last time, and we're looking to do that again this time. Yes, super excited and proud of the team. The GoDaddy Registry team is come into GoDaddy. They've had to go through the integration. We're growing scale for them, as you know, and we have new businesses to integrate with them. But all through it, they have maintained really strong execution. So it's really about good strong execution, the team coming together, it's a small team, but they've done a fantastic job. And of course, as much as we can, we have the ability of that team working with GoDaddy leaders and looking for opportunities and looking for brands. And as I've shared in the past, we'll continue to share with you specific innovations that come forward, but this one is just execution, right? Yes. I'm happy to start there. The real build here is to look at it from the ground up and say, what do our customers need to make these products accessible for them? And we broke down the pricing structure, and it's about technology and innovation. And as you know, we have a fantastic team from Poynt. And our goal is to not lose any money in payments or in hardware. Our goal is to build it up from the bottom, innovate, pass on the value to the customer. And I'm excited about the idea that customers look at this pricing and they adopt and that we see a lot of demand for our products. Thank you. Thank you, Nick. On the giving preferential treatment to certain TLDs that we may own, we don't do that. All TLDs work on our registrar side in terms of their merit. It's about value to the customer whatever works best irrespective of whether we own the registry side or not. That's what we'll sell in front of the customer. We do -- to your question on Verisign price increases, as you well know, I think we -- our pricing is quite nuanced. We have pricing that's different by customer populations. We have pricing that's different by geography. We're pricing that differs when we bundle as an example. So we are always experimenting with pricing. We're always looking to optimize. And we realize that as GoDaddy, we have an opportunity to truly look at our options. And if it makes sense, and as you know, over time, registrars have passed Registry price increases to the customer. We have the option to do that. But we also have the option to not pass the price and look for opportunity to really optimize for profit dollars. And I'll turn it to Mark and maybe Mark, if you have something to add on that. Yes. Nick, just to quickly respond to that, you're right. A lot of customers don't get the dotcom they're looking for because it's already taken, pizza.com, somebody's already got it. What we do is we're improving our search results more and more, where we use machine learning and AI to give the customer options, and those options include TLDs. And it's actually very specific to the search. So it's really not about what TLDs we might own. It's really about what the search is and then providing the customers high up on search as it makes sense with those options with different TLDs and letting the customer make the choice. Sure, Brent. There a couple of data points here. We're looking at overall demand, sort of Google Search traffic as an example. And we're looking at how that's changing and evolving. And obviously, I know you have access to that data, too. But we parse it and we say, okay, is there a shift in the overall universe. And then we're looking at folks coming to our site, the gross customer ad and saying, okay, what percentage of that population is actually becoming customers for GoDaddy or approaching GoDaddy. So what do you see in the guide, the assumptions in it are around what we see over the last four, five months, and we see signals match up in the broader macro with our data. In terms of answering your question on what do we -- how does it compare to the past? Obviously, 2020 was a very large demand cycle, it was big cohorts and so on. So what we're really comparing against is 2019, and these demand signals are more in line with 2019 than 2020. Thanks, Elizabeth. It's really too early to talk about new versus existing users. As you know, we did a big launch called OPEN 21 and attracted a lot of customers, 20,000 folks plus got to see it. We have thousands of folks engaged in detailed sessions where we talked about how to do their marketing, how to sort of manage their off-line and online portfolios and get into the big markets and platforms. So -- but it's all very, very early. And unfortunately, it's too early to comment on any specific numbers. Yes. As you know, we have 1.5 million web Pros on our platform. Given the businesses we're in, we have access to a lot of these Pros. But we built the Hub so we could have engagement with them on a regular basis, give them ways to save them time, giving them ways to be able to do their jobs better and focus on growing customers and their business. The Pros focus on WordPress, that's what the hub is all about optimizing their experience there. And ultimately, what we're looking for is to get a bigger share of wallet with GoDaddy forum. We know Pros support lots of multi-sites. They have a percentage with us, and we know it's a very, very large opportunity for us to get a piece of the rest. Other places that where you'll see some monetization experiments, of course, we launched Invoicing. So that's a good tool. It creates lots of stickiness, but it also creates some economics. We're also experimenting with special offers within the Hub. So where we can try to see what encourages Pros to sort of buy something with GoDaddy versus something else. And just it's -- the idea there is let's try to share with them and say, hey, if you sell this product, we'll give you a piece of it. Those are the types of experiments you'll see, and those also create economics for us. Thank you. Thanks, Sterling. It truly follows sort of the COVID arc that we've talked about in the past and likely UC as well. The demand environment that I talked about actually covered U.S. and international and we see a lot of similarities. Having said that, in certain geos, there is a bigger impact from COVID, and we see demand bounce around a little bit in those geos. But overall, in the GoDaddy portfolio, that's small. So if I look at the overall portfolio, there isn't really 1 geo to specifically call out as having any significant impact. And broadly, the trends are similar. Sterling, the pricing that we announced, the 2.3% plus $0.00 in-store and 2.3% plus $0.30 online, that's the pricing for Payments. But as you know, we have a lot of opportunity to build SKUs and bundles, including new value for these. So the experimentation that we'll be looking at is new SKUs that offer the full suite where customers get the force bang, if you will, and how do we price those things when we bundle things differently, the pricing for the hardware, those are the areas that you'll see us experiment more. Thank you. Thanks, Naved. As you know, Poynt built its customer base, predominantly through channel partners, and those channel partners have banks want to use their rails for payments. But what that GMV does show is customer success. That customers at a very large scale are having a lot of success using this tool set. And obviously, our thesis of having Poynt be a part of GoDaddy is about us selling direct to customers, right? So I would look at that $20 billion as customer success and over time, more and more GPV flowing directly as we sell directly to customers. Yes. Overall, we are happy with the returns on our marketing spend. And what you're really seeing here is over the last year, as demand was very high, we wanted to maintain share of voice. We wanted to lean into that demand. And as the demand came down, we didn't want to pull back on marketing so hard that we actually pull demand down for ourselves. So we let the demand pull the marketing spend down. You're seeing some of that in the efficiency. You're also seeing some optimizations across channels, but no specific comment on channels that we're doing more on or less on. Overall, our demand profile, especially in the way we get bookings broadly remains the same. Thanks, Trevor. On Payments, the feedback on the products has been positive. One thing I talked about previously, if you remember, we had introduced just GoDaddy Payments. I'm not talking about Omnicommerce, GoDaddy Payments in the Websites + Marketing flow. And we had shared that we've seen good adoption from customers on Payments. We continue to see good adoption there. So we know that it's been holding over the last few months. And in terms of other numbers related to OmniCommerce, the devices are getting shipped all over the U.S. So you'll see them soon. But it's really too early to comment on specifics, except that the customer feedback is good. Thank you, Christie. I'll just end with thanking you for joining. We appreciate your questions. I look forward to engaging with you over time and seeing you at our Investor Day in February. A quick thank you to all the GoDaddy teams. A lot goes on for us to be able to deliver these strong results in the quarter, and a big thank you to everyone at GoDaddy. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. I want to take a moment to discuss our financial results for the third quarter and then move to our financial outlook for the rest of 2021. Q3 was a strong quarter, which showed up in the financial results. Total revenue came in at $964 million, growing over 14% year-over-year, which includes 70 basis points of currency tailwind. Our international business grew at 13% on a reported basis, with approximately two points of currency tailwind. As an [Technical Difficulty] trends in the top of the funnel signals continue to be below the elevated demand we saw last year, but in line with 2019. Hosting and Presence grew 7% year-over-year, delivering at the high end of our expectations for mid-single-digit growth. We continue to see nice growth in our Presence products like Websites + Marketing, tempered by slower growth in our legacy hosting and security business. And while it's still too early to provide any details, we are really pleased with what we are seeing so far from our OmniCommerce launch in September as well as the uptake we're seeing from the GoDaddy Payments more broadly. Within Hosting and Presence, we're pleased to share an update to the previously disclosed ARR metric from our Create and Grow group of products, which includes Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios. The suite of products passed $400 million in ARR in Q3. Within that suite, ARR from Websites + Marketing grew more than 20% year-over-year in Q3, and more specifically, Websites + Marketing commerce ARR grew more than 30% year-over-year in Q3. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $25 billion, growing nearly 30% year-over-year. We saw growth across all channels, primarily driven by off-line point-of-sale as we lap online tailwinds from COVID. Domains grew 17% year-over-year. The innovation the teams put in place late last year is driving performance in the aftermarket, which was a large contributor to the growth we saw in the third quarter. We also continue to see consistent renewals and comp primary registrations. And finally, Business Applications was our fastest-growing product line, increasing 20% year-over-year. We continue to see new customer attach, strong renewals and existing customers adding additional seats of e-mail and productivity solutions. Bookings came in at $1.04 billion, rising 10% year-over-year, with 80 basis points of currency tailwind. Strength in bookings in the quarter reflect similar drivers to what we called out for revenue. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter, in line with what we saw both last quarter and the mid-60 range we've guided to. Product mix continues to drive the company's overall gross margin. Given the Payments launch and the pricing we announced in September, we expect Payments revenue to have two different margin impacts as it scales. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as the revenue stream gets larger in the coming quarters and years. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments. So we expect Payments to be highly accretive to normalized EBITDA over time. Investment in tech and dev was consistent with last quarter as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation while maintaining fiscal discipline. We continue to get leverage in G&A as travel and other office expenses remain below historical levels. Consistent with last quarter, our marketing and advertising investment remained strong in Q3, though the year-over-year growth decelerated as we started to lap the elevated investment we made to capture the extraordinary demand we saw last year. Our growth and investment in the second quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $228 million, representing growth of 15% year-over-year. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $252 million, growing 12% year-over-year, driven by strong profitability, continued positive impacts from working capital and disciplined CapEx investment as we continue shifting workloads to the cloud. We note, however, due to the global supply chain issues impacting technology hardware like servers, some of our planned CapEx spending shifted into Q4. We expect to continue our CapEx investment in Q4, bringing unlevered free cash flow in line with our full year guide. Now on to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We finished Q2 with $1.1 billion in cash and total liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt stands at $2.8 billion below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2x to 4x. GoDaddy has a strong liquidity position, access to both debt and equity capital markets and resilient cash-generating operations. During the third quarter, we executed an accelerated share repurchase buying 3.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. We also allocated nearly $200 million to acquisitions in the Registry space. As we think about capital priorities, we will continue to balance M&A and share repurchases to make sure capital is deployed in the way that we believe will generate the best long-term returns for shareholders. After the completion of the ASR mentioned above, we have approximately $750 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. Moving on to our outlook. GoDaddy is on track to outperform the initial revenue and unlevered free cash flow targets we laid out at the beginning of the year. Looking at Q4, we expect total revenue of approximately $970 million or 11% growth year-over-year. Based on our outperformance in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're raising our full year revenue guidance to approximately $3.765 billion, a 14% growth year-over-year. As I noted earlier, some of our CapEx spending has shifted from Q3 to Q4. Based on our continued plan for approximately $60 million in CapEx spending for the full year and the strong performance we've seen year-to-date, we're raising the unlevered free cash flow guidance to $960 million or 16% growth year-over-year. As we mentioned last quarter, we still expect bookings growth to be a couple of points below revenue growth in the final quarter of the year as FX tailwinds continue to abate and we face the tough compares from Q4 of last year. In Q4, we expect Domains revenue to grow low double digits as we lap the tougher compares in the aftermarket from the impact of our list for sale tool and the other improvements introduced in Q4 last year that we talked about last quarter. The aftermarket, as you know, is a non-subscription business, therefore, it does not impact our deferred revenue at the end of the period. We expect Hosting and Presence revenue to deliver mid-single-digit growth for the full year. We continue to see low single-digit growth in our legacy hosting business. We're also lapping very difficult comps in our higher growth products like Websites + Marketing and the top of the funnel softness we saw over the summer will take some time to rebuild, even with the improvements seen in September and October. We've got a strong track record of driving growth. And with an impressive slate of new offerings coming to market, we remain optimistic that we will be able to accelerate the growth of Hosting and Presence next year. We continue to expect high-teens growth in Business Applications for the full year, driven by customer attach, seek growth among existing customers and upgrades to higher-priced tiers of productivity solutions. With respect to investments and expenses, we'll continue investing in the tech and dev as we work to maintain the product momentum we've seen year-to-date. Based on the current demand environment, we're expecting our absolute marketing spend to be relatively flat sequentially in Q4. We continue to expect investments to be largely offset by continued leverage in customer care and G&A. We are still comfortable with the 4-1-1 targets we set out early last year, and we'll provide more specific formal guidance in February. Some of the revenue streams that we expect to become more impactful over time like Payments in aftermarket are recognized immediately. So we would expect bookings growth and revenue growth to converge over time. GoDaddy has an incredibly bright road ahead and is well equipped with both the innovation and the financial resources needed to pursue and capture the immense opportunity before us. Our consistent cash generation gives us multiple levers to generate significant returns for our shareholders, and we're committed to doing just that. As we prepare for our Investor Day in February, I'm excited about the direction of the company, our strategic vision and the plans we are putting in place to enhance investor communication and outreach. GoDaddy is committed to providing investors with the information they need each quarter to model their business confidently, value the business effectively and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objective. It's going to be an exciting day, and we look forward to being with all of you then. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. Yes. Thanks, Clarke. And I'll take the first part of it and then maybe hand it to Aman for the historical part. We're seeing positive signs in our Create and Grow, and we are really happy with the ARR around Websites + Marketing with 20% and Websites + Marketing commerce at 30%. Acknowledging the softness and looking at Q4, that funnel slowdown will take a little bit of time to rebuild like we said in our comments, but we're really optimistic on the positive signs. As we also said, we're comfortable with the 4-1-1 moving forward, and we are really looking forward to catching up with one everybody on Investor Day and kind of putting it all together so we can communicate to you. Yes. Thanks, Aman. One, just to enforce pricing for -- pricing wasn't an impact on Q3 for us, just as an FYI. When we do look at pricing, we are solving for gross profit. But if it comes to market share versus gross profit, we will go with market share. And we do not use any type of broad brush approach to pricing increases. We really look at it on a market-by-market basis. Yes. And I'll just add to that, Aman. Aftermarket does help us present to them names that they might not be able to get otherwise. So it is driving some of our aftermarket growth as well. I kind of look at it as a cycle. We are -- we saw a divergence. Now we're seeing a convergence come back the other way. And we do, like you said, expect them to equal out over time, and we're starting to see that happen now. But we had large cohorts last year. They went into our deferred revenue. They're being amortized out now. And as they're being replaced by smaller cohorts, it's going to result in that divergence you're seeing right now. Elizabeth, I'll just add what we're seeing. We're really excited about it. And the great thing about launching a quarter early is we'll get to see data a quarter early. So we're really looking forward to adding some color on the Investor Day. I'll add to that, Naved. We expect it to be flat for Q4, just in case we're asking that question as well. And Trevor, I'll just add, without getting into the breakdown of some of that pricing. Just a couple of data points. One, we don't plan to lose money on the hardware and the payments. And our expectation, although we'll see a little bit of margin pressure at the gross level, it should be accretive to our normalized EBITDA going forward."

With me on the call today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. If you would like to ask a question on today\u2019s call, please use the Raise Hand feature in the webinar, to be added to the queue. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics, such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents, may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website, at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today\u2019s earnings release. The matters we\u2019ll be discussing today, include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, strategies and objectives with respect to future operations, new product introductions and innovations, partner integrations, our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, August 4th, 2021, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements, as a result of new information or future events, unless required by law. With that, here\u2019s Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is about making opportunity inclusive for all. We are committed to making everyday entrepreneurs successful through bold innovation and disciplined execution, we will succeed in our mission. More than 20 million customers rely on GoDaddy\u2019s seamless and intuitive technology, highly performant products and world class customer care to help them grow their business online and offline. As I look back at the last quarter and the last year, I am most proud of the acceleration in innovation at the company, even in the face of a pandemic. Our teams have done a fantastic job delivering new functionality for our customers and every quarter we are delivering more. Today, I will highlight some of those key product launches driven by the increasing velocity of experimentation in every part of our business. I have never been more confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers faster and drive long-term financial results for our shareholders. The vaccines had provided a new normal, but now we find the world challenged by the Delta variant. We\u2019re staying vigilant regarding any short-term impact from the difficulties our customers continue to face coming out of the pandemic. As I look at the rest of the year, and given our history of providing prudent guidance to our shareholders, I am confident that following a strong first half, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial targets. Our core focus is to drive value over the long-term through continuous improvements in our products and services. The long-term secular tailwinds in our industry continue to play to our strengths. As more people and businesses seek to sell their products and services online and offline, they need intuitive solutions and a trusted partner that can help guide them to growth. Our priorities are aligned with our customers, and they remain clear. First, driving commerce through presence, second, GoDaddy Pros, and third, innovation in domains. Everyday entrepreneurs look to GoDaddy for help with their number one priority to reach more of their customers and grow their business. It is also our number one priority and our investments reflect that. True to our promise, we have moved quickly this year with the launch of GoDaddy Payments, already available to all Websites + Marketing customers and managed WordPress customers in the U.S. Our ability to integrate Poynt and launch Payments quickly is a proof point of our platform-based approach to commerce and presence. We\u2019re dedicated to creating a seamless and intuitive experience for our customers built on a common platform. That increases our agility and speed to market. As further proof, we\u2019re already looking beyond Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. We\u2019re launching GoDaddy PayLinks and Virtual Terminal. With PayLinks, GoDaddy customers will finally be able to say goodbye to sending paper invoices. PayLinks enables customers to take payments from anyone in the U.S. through a secure link. And with the Virtual Terminal, they can accept payments through iOS and Android on their phone or tablet without a card reader, ideal for farmers markets, craft fairs and other remote sales. And we have much more coming. We are on track to launch GoDaddy\u2019s OmniCommerce solution by the end of the year, empowering our customers to sell everywhere in their physical store, on their online store and across major platforms. And we have deepened our partnerships with the major platforms, especially Google and Facebook. GoDaddy customers can now display their product inventory directly within Google Search, Shopping, Image Search, and YouTube for free. They can also create listings and manage their Google Smart Ad campaigns directly within their GoDaddy Websites + Marketing dashboard. Customers can also manage their Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns from the same dashboard. Websites + Marketing continues to launch new capabilities including functionality for job listings, critical in the current environment, a robust FAQ widget, an enhanced email composer and much more. We have also completed the integration of Over, rebranding it as GoDaddy Studios. We\u2019ve expanded the functionality as well, and now GoDaddy customers can seamlessly create content on iOS and Android, and leverage that content on social networks and their website. Moving on to our second priority, GoDaddy Pros. We continue to focus on creating a seamless and intuitive experience with WordPress, while maintaining flexibility for Pros. We are committed to driving real improvements in the WordPress ecosystem, and are thrilled to share that one of GoDaddy\u2019s own led the release of the latest version of the Gutenberg editor for WordPress. WordPress has been the winning platform for Pros for years, and we are confident that WordPress will continue to be the winning platform for years to come. Earlier this year, we created a dramatically simplified onboarding experience, and we\u2019ve invested to make managed WordPress even more performant. And we\u2019re hearing from customers that they are noticing the difference. Our goal is to save time for Pros and inside the GoDaddy Hub we are seeing continued improvement. We are launching new capabilities in the Hub on a regular basis and we are particularly excited about introducing invoicing. With invoicing, Pros can bill their customers without needing a separate system. We also launched the new GoDaddy Pro brand in India this quarter and we are starting to see early signs of traction. India represents an enormous opportunity for GoDaddy, and we\u2019re looking forward to hosting our first event for Pros in India, later this year. And for our third priority, we continue to see remarkable strength in domains, driven by innovation in our aftermarket business, as well as strong renewals and continued new registrations. As you may recall, in Q4 last year we introduced List for Sale and multiple improvements in domain search. These innovations contributed to the nearly 20% year-over-year revenue growth in domains through the first half of this year. In Q2, we launched Buy It Now landing pages for domain investors to sell premium domains faster and more efficiently. And customers have reacted positively to it. One major domain investor moved approximately 50 thousand domains to GoDaddy\u2019s platform, and the improvement in their sales was so immediate that they decided to move over their entire portfolio of ccTLDs as well. The customer described the experience as an absolute game changer. We\u2019ve also continued to enhance the experience for buyers, with an improved search in our Auctions experience. We\u2019re thrilled with the outcomes in this space and excited about continuing to innovate. We\u2019re also seeing good progress in scaling our GoDaddy Registry business. With the recent acquisitions of additional Top Level Domains, or TLDs, GoDaddy Registry now manages more than 240 total TLDs, and we continue to look for ways to out-punch our weight in the Registry business. I\u2019m also super excited to share that we published GoDaddy\u2019s first Environmental, Social, and Governance or ESG report in June. I encourage you to read our report and learn about the fantastic initiatives going on inside GoDaddy. We look forward to setting goals and reporting on our ESG results regularly going forward. In closing, we have accelerated the pace of innovation within GoDaddy. Our strategy remains centered on building incredible products and creating value for everyday entrepreneurs around the world. We are prudent stewards of capital and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. With a number of organic and inorganic investments, especially around commerce and our upcoming OmniCommerce launch, we believe we are positioning GoDaddy for continued growth in our top line and our profits for years to come. With that, here\u2019s Mark. Thanks, Aman. It\u2019s great to be here on my first earnings call as GoDaddy\u2019s CFO. I\u2019m two months in, and I can tell that there is something special about GoDaddy\u2019s culture, people, vision and commitment to our customers. As Aman mentioned, there is an incredible opportunity ahead of this company, and I am very excited to join at this stage of the journey. I want to take a moment to discuss our financial results for the second quarter, and then I\u2019ll provide an update on what we\u2019re seeing now, and our financial outlook for Q3 and the rest of 2021. Q2 was a strong quarter, and that showed up in the financial results. Total revenue came in at $931 million, growing over 15% year-over-year, which includes about 1 point of currency tailwind. Our International business grew 19% on a reported basis, with approximately 3 points of currency tailwind. Business Applications was our fastest growing product line, increasing 22% year-over-year. We continued to see new customer attach, strong renewals, and existing customers adding additional seats of email and productivity solutions. Domains grew 18% year-over-year. As Aman mentioned, the innovation that the teams put in place late last year is driving performance in the aftermarket, which was a large contributor to the growth we saw in the second quarter. We are also seeing strong renewal rates from huge cohorts that joined last year and continued new registrations. And finally, hosting and presence grew 9% year-over-year, in line with our expectation of high single-digit growth. We continue to see very nice growth in our presence products like Websites + Marketing, tempered by slower growth in our legacy hosting and security business with continued year-over-year declines in social. Bookings came in at $1.05 billion, rising 13% year-over-year, with 2 points of currency tailwind. Strength in bookings in the quarter reflects similar drivers to what we called out for revenue. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter, in line with what we saw both last quarter, and in the second quarter last year. Product mix continues to drive the company\u2019s overall gross margin, and we\u2019re pleased with the 16% year-over-year growth we saw in gross profit dollars in the second quarter. Growth in both G&A and tech and dev expenses decelerated this quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, there were some one-time expenses related to our Poynt acquisition that were recognized in T&D and G&A in Q1 that didn\u2019t repeat in Q2. The growth rate in T&D remains above what we saw in 2020, reflecting the outstanding talent we added via the Poynt acquisition, and our continued investment in product development. Our marketing and advertising investment remains strong in Q2, though the year-over-year growth decelerated as we start to lap the elevated investment we made to capture the extraordinary demand we saw last year. Our growth and investment in the second quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $198 million, representing a growth of 22% year-over-year. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, growing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong profitability, continued positive impacts from working capital, and disciplined CapEx investments as we continue shifting workloads to the cloud. Now onto the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with $1.4 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $2 billion. Net debt stands at $2.6 billion, below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2x to 4x. GoDaddy has a strong liquidity position, access to both debt and equity capital markets, and resilient cash-generating operations. During the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $81 million, and announced acquisitions in the Registry space. Our priorities for capital allocation haven\u2019t changed. Our strategic priority is to grow the business, and we\u2019ll continue with organic investment as well as through acquisitions. We will continue to prioritize M&A over share repurchases. That said, we still have approximately $1 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, and we expect to deploy capital to repurchase shares opportunistically. Moving on to our outlook. GoDaddy has a strong, resilient business model giving us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year targets. Following a strong first half, we want to acknowledge the evolving impact of the pandemic, COVID variants and access to the vaccines and we want to be prudent with our guidance for the second half of the year. We expect our full year revenue to be approximately $3.75 billion, or 13% growth year-over-year. And we continue to expect unlevered free cash flow of $955 million or 16% growth year-over-year. While we don\u2019t typically guide to bookings explicitly, we want to provide some color. We expect bookings growth to be a couple points below revenue growth in the back half of the year. Our forecast assumes that FX tailwinds will abate, and we\u2019re facing tough compares. We expect revenue growth in domains to moderate, especially in Q4, exiting the year growing low double digits. We\u2019re also facing tougher compares in the aftermarket as we lap the impact of the List for Sale tool and other improvements introduced in Q4 last year. The aftermarket, as you know, is a non-subscription business. We expect hosting and presence revenue to deliver mid single-digit growth for the full year. We continue to see low single-digit growth in our legacy hosting business. We\u2019re also lapping very difficult comps in our higher-growth products like Websites + Marketing, and continued declines in Social. We also note that the moderation of the FX tailwinds will disproportionately impact this line. We\u2019ve got a strong track record of driving growth, and our goal is to accelerate the growth in this category beyond 2021. We continue to expect high-teens growth in business applications for the year. With respect to investments and expenses, we continue investing in tech and dev, as we drive development of OmniCommerce and better scale our engineering and developer teams for long-term growth. Marketing spend is governed by returns, so we\u2019ll continue to monitor and adjust based on the demand we\u2019re seeing in the market. Investments here will likely be offset by continued leverage in customer care and G&A. For Q3, we expect total revenue of approximately $945 million, or 12% growth year-over-year with high-teens growth in business applications, mid-teens growth in domains as we lap a slightly tougher comp, and mid-single-digit growth in hosting and presence. As I wrap up my comments here, I want to express my thanks for the incredible welcome I\u2019ve received from all of the wonderful people at GoDaddy, as well as our partners throughout the industry and our analysts. I will do everything I can to ensure that we are executing against all the financial and strategic priorities we\u2019ve laid out, and that we\u2019re communicating clearly and transparently with all of our stakeholders. I know I have big shoes to fill, and I\u2019m looking forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months as we virtually hit the road. With that, we\u2019ll have Christie Masoner from our IR team, open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on a segment basis, it seems like the H&P guide was a bit softer than prior commentary. If I heard you correctly, Mark, you said mid single digit growth for the full year. Can you help us understand what changed? And then also remind us to what the impact is in 3Q from lapping M&A, or is that more of just a 4Q impact? Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Trevor and happy to elaborate a bit. Let\u2019s start with \u2013 we\u2019re facing tough comps when it comes to some of our higher product growth, right? Websites + Marketing and things such as that I would also say, FX is not working in our favor in the second half where we assumed we will not have the same tailwinds. And we continue to see low growth in our hosting and security. So that coupled together kind of has put us today mid single digit growth for the year. I would also add we\u2019re being pretty prudent when it comes to looking at customer behaviour, especially as we get into the second half of the year. We just want to acknowledge there\u2019s a lot going on with our consumers. And we think this is the place to be right now. As far as the lapping in Q3 and Q4, we see part of it in Q3 and the bulk of it in Q4.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Brent, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hi. This is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. Firstly, I\u2019ll say Aman, really encouraging to hear about the product innovation and how quickly the company has been able to iterate on the Poynt portfolio. It\u2019s exciting progress so far. On that point, could you help us understand what\u2019s the current level of adoption you\u2019re seeing in Payments? And maybe what are some of your key strategies for encouraging adoption? Some of your peers have pursued transaction feeds for not selecting the preferred payment rails. So, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2019re not doing that strategy specifically. So I just want to see where do you see potential for push versus pull strategies to increasing adoption?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Clarke. As you know, we\u2019ve just launched GoDaddy Payments and we\u2019re seeing a good reaction from customers. They\u2019re excited, they\u2019re clicking on it, they\u2019re choosing the product. So it\u2019s a great, great start. Overall, our timing on commerce was about getting to the OmniCommerce solution later this year, next year is about marketing and experimentation with pricing. So you\u2019ll see us experiment with a lot of our models out there. And as we go through that, we\u2019re going to pick what\u2019s best for our customers and shareholders together. So no specific comment on various pricing strategies, but we\u2019ve got to start and we\u2019re going to try a lot of stuff out.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. And if I could have a follow-up for Mark, just could you comment on the legacy hosting and security business. Just what are the growth expectations long-term for that segment? How should we be thinking about the moderation currently in that segment? And is there an R&D push here, any kind of change in industry demand that we should anticipate for that segment going forward?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks. And I\u2019ll start with saying, a lot of the hosting and security is driven by traffic. And as in that particular area, we\u2019re monitoring the traffic very closely. We think it will continue with low digit growth throughout the year. We\u2019ll take a look at what the long-term prospects are. And I\u2019ll just start with or say, I\u2019m looking forward to checking in with everybody six months from now and looking at the 2022 guidance as we put it forth.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal, please unmute your line.\nYgal Arounian: Sorry about that. Good afternoon. So you guys had good outperformance in the quarter and just trying to think through the second half and the puts and takes. And I know you addressed it a little bit. So if I remember correctly last quarter, you talked about how we\u2019d be facing some challenging comps in domains, but continued innovation there can keep growth elevated for longer. So, on the domain side, where do you guys think you are relative to that kind of target that traction that you talked about last quarter in terms of innovation and keeping growth stronger? And similarly on the presence side, I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of pieces coming together around commerce and the omni-channel piece is coming in later this year, and I know it\u2019s still early on the omni-channel front, but payments and everything else. What are the things that investors should be looking for to get better confidence that that the Presence segment is growing faster and getting stronger as you put these things together. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Ygal. Continue to be super excited about the innovation in the domains business. As I\u2019ve talked about last time as well, we\u2019re continuing to do more every quarter. And the goal here is to build the innovation factory, where we\u2019re the leader in this space and we\u2019re going to just continue to innovate. But we can only guide, what we see, we can\u2019t guide to sort of future innovation. But it\u2019s happening every quarter. Just this quarter, I talked about it in the prepared comments, we launched Buy-It-Now landers, and they\u2019ve been adopted really, really well by our domain investor customers. So you\u2019ll continue to see us do it. It\u2019s just \u2013 when it comes to guidance, we\u2019ll talk about what we see and what we know. And in terms of presence, we continue to see fantastic growth in \u2013 in our growth products like Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. They\u2019re still outgrowing our overall business, even though they have some really tough comps year-over-year, so super excited about the work happening there as well.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. Thanks. And if I could follow-up on the comments around customer behaviour. And you\u2019ve had really strong customer behavior for \u2013 essentially since the early days of the pandemic. Are you seeing things changed or still down? I would think any kind of resurgence in COVID would kind of bring customer behavior even stronger, not weaker. Just let\u2019s talk about from what you\u2019re seeing there.\nAman Bhutani: At a macro level, obviously we\u2019re all excited to have vaccine and be able to have a sense of normal, but these are unprecedented times. We don\u2019t really know how customer behavior is shifting. And my view always goes to whatever changes we see are short-term, long-term the opportunity in terms of online and offline coming together as massive. Our customers need to get out there, they need to sell everywhere. We\u2019re building a set of products, portfolio services that meet that need. We have a massive brand. So I\u2019m just super bullish our opportunity long-term there.\nMark McCaffrey: Aman, I\u2019ll jump onto that a bit. We continue to be really, really excited about the long-term prospects. But we\u2019ve been prudent in the guidance, we\u2019re taking a look at the market. We\u2019re taking a look at the behavior and we\u2019ll continue to monitor for the short-term.\nYgal Arounian: Appreciate the answers guys. Thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP. Ron, please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Aman, you might\u2019ve touched on this earlier, but I wanted to ask a little bit more here just with commerce being a top priority overall and payments now live omni-channel solution coming. So maybe just asking as we exit 2021 and go into 2022, when these products evolve here, just talk to us about just the next call it, how you view commerce evolving on GoDaddy. Do you think we\u2019re still into building out new products or now we\u2019re in execution mode? I think you might\u2019ve answered this earlier or at least unnecessarily, but I wanted to ask it maybe a different way. And then I want to also talk about the Google Merchant Center product that was announced, I think a few weeks back. Just talk about how this integration here could really play out going forward. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Ron. And on commerce, as we\u2019ve discussed, the strategy is about meeting a broad set of needs for our customers. And 2021 is the build here, we\u2019re moving very, very quickly. We\u2019ve got payments out there. I talked about PayLinks, Virtual Terminal. We\u2019re going to have OmniCommerce by the end of the year. We\u2019re talking about invoicing for GoDaddy Pro. So a lot happening in the commerce space where we\u2019re looking at the customer need and we\u2019re bringing it out very quickly. 2022 is the year of experimentation. It\u2019s really too early right now to talk about what different things may happen there. We\u2019re going to go-to-market, there\u2019s a set of marketing experiments, set of experiments around pricing that we\u2019re going to be working on. And generally the initial reaction is from customers where they see our products and they want to work with GoDaddy on it. And in terms of Google or some of the Facebook announcements as well, what we\u2019re most excited about is creating a seamless and intuitive experience for our customers. For our customers to be able to go into one dashboard and manage systems, not just for their online store and with OmniCommerce there in store, but to be able to manage their spend on major platforms, all from the same place, all on look and feel seamless, intuitive, easy. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s what we\u2019re most excited about.\nRon Josey: Great. Thank you, Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, kind of two along the same line of thinking. I guess, Mark can you give an update on the kind of M&A we can expect. You made some acquisitions in domains, there was Poynt, I mean, there are other sizable acquisitions out there you could make? Or should we think about it more as tuck-ins? And then maybe separately, how do you think about partnerships in terms of kind of enabling SMBs to really utilize your platform to the fullest extent for those who maybe don\u2019t know how to? Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes, thanks, Nick. I'll take that one. Really quick, obviously, we don't comment on ongoing M&A, but we will continue to look at opportunities that bring value to our customers. The one great thing about our balance sheet is, it gives us optionality to look at all sorts of deals. But we're not going to comment on anything currently. When it comes to partnerships, our ecosystem is extremely important. We will continue to look at that ecosystem and again, where it makes sense to partner with people in the market and everything is about the focus on the customer and bringing them value and ultimately strengthening that ecosystem.\nChristie Masoner: Nick, please unmute your line. Our next question comes from Drew Glaeser from JPMorgan. Drew, please go ahead.\nDrew Glaeser: Hi, this is Drew on for Sterling. So we've seen news reports that GoDaddy, well pass along the Verizon \u2013 Verisign price increase when it goes into effect in September. Can you confirm whether that will be the case and how you expect that to impact revenue and margins?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, the tradition in the industry has been for registrars to pass on that pricing. What's important about that with GoDaddy is that we have a segmented customer base and we take a nuanced approach to that pricing based on the type of customer. So we will be doing that the same strategy that we have done in the past. And I'll turn it to Mark to talk about the revenue.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. And we have built this into the forecast. We had it in all along these things aren't unusual and as Aman mentioned, we've traditionally passed them on. So they are in the forecast for the second half.\nDrew Glaeser: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Deepak, please go ahead.\nFrank Volpe: Hi, everyone. Frank Volpe here for Deepak. So just expanding on that last question about Verisign price increases, I wanted to get your opinion on whether you expect industry wide adoption of these higher prices. And then on the registry business, do you see any other interesting opportunities or other extensions that you can eventually integrate with the products? I mean, if you can't disclose anything confidential, that's fine. Just how we should be looking at it, is this important here?\nAman Bhutani: Hi. Yes, I can take that. On the pricing for other players, obviously I can't comment to what other companies are going to do, but obviously the historically you can look at what companies have done probably got a pretty good idea. On the registry business, continue to be really excited about what we can do there for the industry as a whole. As I talked about last quarter, our first goal there is to get to create a scale and you saw us do a few acquisitions. We announced 240 TLDs. Our goal is to have a certain scale where we can experiment with innovative ideas. We do have a few ideas and I've talked about one or two in the past, but where as we get closer to them and customers likely see them, I'd love for them to get out there and then we can talk about them more.\nFrank Volpe: Got it. And then just one more, if I can, can you give us some perspective on share buybacks the next few quarters and how we should be thinking about those?\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks. And I'll take that one. We always look at capital allocation and as we've said in the script, our priority is around accelerating growth whether organically or through M&A having said that we will continue to look at share buyback and be opportunistic and provide value back to our shareholders where appropriate.\nFrank Volpe: Great. Thanks so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yes. Can you hear me okay? Just maybe I missed it, but did you guys talk about subscriber growth in the quarter [Audio Dip] how it compares to past few quarters. And maybe another question, you can help us understand and bit of summarize. Just a mix of e-commerce in Websites + Marketing roughly [Audio Dip] e-commerce, is that still the case?\nMark McCaffrey: I had a tough time hearing the question there. So I'm going to answer what I think was the second part, and then we might have do a repeat on the first part. I think you were asking for kind of directional guidance on the impact of e-commerce. I will tell you, well we're really, really excited about the launch of payments in the first half. And the launch of omni-commerce in the second half where we're not getting into the financial numbers, we're still looking at the impact on our customers. And if you could go back to the first question.\nChristie Masoner: Yes. Naved, we lost your audio in your first question, if you could repeat the first part of the question\nMark McCaffrey: Into that matter, if I didn't get the second question, right. Let me know. It was kind of in and out.\nNaved Khan: Let me try one more time. Hopefully, you get it now. So the first question is, just around subscriber, number four for the second quarter and how that compares with the growth in the past report that we have seen. And the second question I had was just around the mix of commerce subscribers. I think in the past, we've talked about the roughly 25%, is that still the case?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Naved for repeating the question. On subscriber accounts, we don't disclose that on a quarterly basis. So we'll share that with you at the end of the year and in terms of our commerce solutions, that part of Websites + Marketing customers continue to lean into that. We've continued to lean in and add more and more functionality. So that continues to do well for us.\nNaved Khan: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Elliott from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Elizabeth, please unmute your line. Our next question comes from line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. There were some questions around Verisign price hike and how you tend this pass that through. Can you just comment on that intended price hike, and then secondarily Aman, when you look at the business apps high teens growth, could you just lay out, , the engines of, of how you're getting there, maybe if you could just talk to, you know, broader how, how, you know, what's underlying that confidence to get to that growth rate on the, on the business app side, on the components of growth. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, sure. Brent, thank you. On the pricing increase with Verisign, what I talked about was that we have a segment of strategy. So we have different types of customers and we changed pricing at different levels for them. Traditionally registrars have passed on the pricing from registries. So there is a pass on from us, but as Mark commented, that's been in our guide. But it's a segment in nuance approach. So I just want folks to understand that about the company as a whole. In terms of the second part of your question, sorry, what was the second part?\nBrent Thill: You think the engines of growth [Audio Dip] applications initiative.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, sorry, there's little delay. In terms of the business apps growth that continues to be a function of customers\u2019 on boarding on our email products, both the Microsoft solution that we have and OX and us growing with our customers. But those customers do well are successful, is to see growth with them. We continue to be underpenetrated here. There's a ton of opportunity as we reach more and more customers as we make the experience. And what are there have been some on boarding improvements for customers that we've been able to do. We've come been able to continue to drive growth with existing customers and new customers there.\nBrent Thill: [Technical Difficulty]\nChristie Masoner: Brent, we're getting your \u2013 we're getting a breakup on your line. If you could try again. That concludes our call for the day. Thank you everyone for joining us and I'll turn it over to Aman for some closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you all for joining. A quick thank you to all the GoDaddy employees for accelerating the innovation at the company and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.",

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is about making opportunity inclusive for all. We are committed to making everyday entrepreneurs successful through bold innovation and disciplined execution, we will succeed in our mission. More than 20 million customers rely on GoDaddy's seamless and intuitive technology, highly performant products and world class customer care to help them grow their business online and offline. As I look back at the last quarter and the last year, I am most proud of the acceleration in innovation at the company, even in the face of a pandemic. Our teams have done a fantastic job delivering new functionality for our customers and every quarter we are delivering more. Today, I will highlight some of those key product launches driven by the increasing velocity of experimentation in every part of our business. I have never been more confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers faster and drive long-term financial results for our shareholders. The vaccines had provided a new normal, but now we find the world challenged by the Delta variant. We're staying vigilant regarding any short-term impact from the difficulties our customers continue to face coming out of the pandemic. As I look at the rest of the year, and given our history of providing prudent guidance to our shareholders, I am confident that following a strong first half, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial targets. Our core focus is to drive value over the long-term through continuous improvements in our products and services. The long-term secular tailwinds in our industry continue to play to our strengths. As more people and businesses seek to sell their products and services online and offline, they need intuitive solutions and a trusted partner that can help guide them to growth. Our priorities are aligned with our customers, and they remain clear. First, driving commerce through presence, second, GoDaddy Pros, and third, innovation in domains. Everyday entrepreneurs look to GoDaddy for help with their number one priority to reach more of their customers and grow their business. It is also our number one priority and our investments reflect that. True to our promise, we have moved quickly this year with the launch of GoDaddy Payments, already available to all Websites + Marketing customers and managed WordPress customers in the U.S. Our ability to integrate Poynt and launch Payments quickly is a proof point of our platform-based approach to commerce and presence. We're dedicated to creating a seamless and intuitive experience for our customers built on a common platform. That increases our agility and speed to market. As further proof, we're already looking beyond Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. We're launching GoDaddy PayLinks and Virtual Terminal. With PayLinks, GoDaddy customers will finally be able to say goodbye to sending paper invoices. PayLinks enables customers to take payments from anyone in the U.S. through a secure link. And with the Virtual Terminal, they can accept payments through iOS and Android on their phone or tablet without a card reader, ideal for farmers markets, craft fairs and other remote sales. And we have much more coming. We are on track to launch GoDaddy's OmniCommerce solution by the end of the year, empowering our customers to sell everywhere in their physical store, on their online store and across major platforms. And we have deepened our partnerships with the major platforms, especially Google and Facebook. GoDaddy customers can now display their product inventory directly within Google Search, Shopping, Image Search, and YouTube for free. They can also create listings and manage their Google Smart Ad campaigns directly within their GoDaddy Websites + Marketing dashboard. Customers can also manage their Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns from the same dashboard. Websites + Marketing continues to launch new capabilities including functionality for job listings, critical in the current environment, a robust FAQ widget, an enhanced email composer and much more. We have also completed the integration of Over, rebranding it as GoDaddy Studios. We've expanded the functionality as well, and now GoDaddy customers can seamlessly create content on iOS and Android, and leverage that content on social networks and their website. Moving on to our second priority, GoDaddy Pros. We continue to focus on creating a seamless and intuitive experience with WordPress, while maintaining flexibility for Pros. We are committed to driving real improvements in the WordPress ecosystem, and are thrilled to share that one of GoDaddy's own led the release of the latest version of the Gutenberg editor for WordPress. WordPress has been the winning platform for Pros for years, and we are confident that WordPress will continue to be the winning platform for years to come. Earlier this year, we created a dramatically simplified onboarding experience, and we've invested to make managed WordPress even more performant. And we're hearing from customers that they are noticing the difference. Our goal is to save time for Pros and inside the GoDaddy Hub we are seeing continued improvement. We are launching new capabilities in the Hub on a regular basis and we are particularly excited about introducing invoicing. With invoicing, Pros can bill their customers without needing a separate system. We also launched the new GoDaddy Pro brand in India this quarter and we are starting to see early signs of traction. India represents an enormous opportunity for GoDaddy, and we're looking forward to hosting our first event for Pros in India, later this year. And for our third priority, we continue to see remarkable strength in domains, driven by innovation in our aftermarket business, as well as strong renewals and continued new registrations. As you may recall, in Q4 last year we introduced List for Sale and multiple improvements in domain search. These innovations contributed to the nearly 20% year-over-year revenue growth in domains through the first half of this year. In Q2, we launched Buy It Now landing pages for domain investors to sell premium domains faster and more efficiently. And customers have reacted positively to it. One major domain investor moved approximately 50 thousand domains to GoDaddy's platform, and the improvement in their sales was so immediate that they decided to move over their entire portfolio of ccTLDs as well. The customer described the experience as an absolute game changer. We've also continued to enhance the experience for buyers, with an improved search in our Auctions experience. We're thrilled with the outcomes in this space and excited about continuing to innovate. We're also seeing good progress in scaling our GoDaddy Registry business. With the recent acquisitions of additional Top Level Domains, or TLDs, GoDaddy Registry now manages more than 240 total TLDs, and we continue to look for ways to out-punch our weight in the Registry business. I'm also super excited to share that we published GoDaddy's first Environmental, Social, and Governance or ESG report in June. I encourage you to read our report and learn about the fantastic initiatives going on inside GoDaddy. We look forward to setting goals and reporting on our ESG results regularly going forward. In closing, we have accelerated the pace of innovation within GoDaddy. Our strategy remains centered on building incredible products and creating value for everyday entrepreneurs around the world. We are prudent stewards of capital and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. With a number of organic and inorganic investments, especially around commerce and our upcoming OmniCommerce launch, we believe we are positioning GoDaddy for continued growth in our top line and our profits for years to come. With that, here's Mark. Thanks, Aman. It's great to be here on my first earnings call as GoDaddy's CFO. I'm two months in, and I can tell that there is something special about GoDaddy's culture, people, vision and commitment to our customers. As Aman mentioned, there is an incredible opportunity ahead of this company, and I am very excited to join at this stage of the journey. I want to take a moment to discuss our financial results for the second quarter, and then I'll provide an update on what we're seeing now, and our financial outlook for Q3 and the rest of 2021. Q2 was a strong quarter, and that showed up in the financial results. Total revenue came in at $931 million, growing over 15% year-over-year, which includes about 1 point of currency tailwind. Our International business grew 19% on a reported basis, with approximately 3 points of currency tailwind. Business Applications was our fastest growing product line, increasing 22% year-over-year. We continued to see new customer attach, strong renewals, and existing customers adding additional seats of email and productivity solutions. Domains grew 18% year-over-year. As Aman mentioned, the innovation that the teams put in place late last year is driving performance in the aftermarket, which was a large contributor to the growth we saw in the second quarter. We are also seeing strong renewal rates from huge cohorts that joined last year and continued new registrations. And finally, hosting and presence grew 9% year-over-year, in line with our expectation of high single-digit growth. We continue to see very nice growth in our presence products like Websites + Marketing, tempered by slower growth in our legacy hosting and security business with continued year-over-year declines in social. Bookings came in at $1.05 billion, rising 13% year-over-year, with 2 points of currency tailwind. Strength in bookings in the quarter reflects similar drivers to what we called out for revenue. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter, in line with what we saw both last quarter, and in the second quarter last year. Product mix continues to drive the company's overall gross margin, and we're pleased with the 16% year-over-year growth we saw in gross profit dollars in the second quarter. Growth in both G&A and tech and dev expenses decelerated this quarter. As you'll recall, there were some one-time expenses related to our Poynt acquisition that were recognized in T&D and G&A in Q1 that didn't repeat in Q2. The growth rate in T&D remains above what we saw in 2020, reflecting the outstanding talent we added via the Poynt acquisition, and our continued investment in product development. Our marketing and advertising investment remains strong in Q2, though the year-over-year growth decelerated as we start to lap the elevated investment we made to capture the extraordinary demand we saw last year. Our growth and investment in the second quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $198 million, representing a growth of 22% year-over-year. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, growing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong profitability, continued positive impacts from working capital, and disciplined CapEx investments as we continue shifting workloads to the cloud. Now onto the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with $1.4 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $2 billion. Net debt stands at $2.6 billion, below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2x to 4x. GoDaddy has a strong liquidity position, access to both debt and equity capital markets, and resilient cash-generating operations. During the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $81 million, and announced acquisitions in the Registry space. Our priorities for capital allocation haven't changed. Our strategic priority is to grow the business, and we'll continue with organic investment as well as through acquisitions. We will continue to prioritize M&A over share repurchases. That said, we still have approximately $1 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, and we expect to deploy capital to repurchase shares opportunistically. Moving on to our outlook. GoDaddy has a strong, resilient business model giving us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year targets. Following a strong first half, we want to acknowledge the evolving impact of the pandemic, COVID variants and access to the vaccines and we want to be prudent with our guidance for the second half of the year. We expect our full year revenue to be approximately $3.75 billion, or 13% growth year-over-year. And we continue to expect unlevered free cash flow of $955 million or 16% growth year-over-year. While we don't typically guide to bookings explicitly, we want to provide some color. We expect bookings growth to be a couple points below revenue growth in the back half of the year. Our forecast assumes that FX tailwinds will abate, and we're facing tough compares. We expect revenue growth in domains to moderate, especially in Q4, exiting the year growing low double digits. We're also facing tougher compares in the aftermarket as we lap the impact of the List for Sale tool and other improvements introduced in Q4 last year. The aftermarket, as you know, is a non-subscription business. We expect hosting and presence revenue to deliver mid single-digit growth for the full year. We continue to see low single-digit growth in our legacy hosting business. We're also lapping very difficult comps in our higher-growth products like Websites + Marketing, and continued declines in Social. We also note that the moderation of the FX tailwinds will disproportionately impact this line. We've got a strong track record of driving growth, and our goal is to accelerate the growth in this category beyond 2021. We continue to expect high-teens growth in business applications for the year. With respect to investments and expenses, we continue investing in tech and dev, as we drive development of OmniCommerce and better scale our engineering and developer teams for long-term growth. Marketing spend is governed by returns, so we'll continue to monitor and adjust based on the demand we're seeing in the market. Investments here will likely be offset by continued leverage in customer care and G&A. For Q3, we expect total revenue of approximately $945 million, or 12% growth year-over-year with high-teens growth in business applications, mid-teens growth in domains as we lap a slightly tougher comp, and mid-single-digit growth in hosting and presence. As I wrap up my comments here, I want to express my thanks for the incredible welcome I've received from all of the wonderful people at GoDaddy, as well as our partners throughout the industry and our analysts. I will do everything I can to ensure that we are executing against all the financial and strategic priorities we've laid out, and that we're communicating clearly and transparently with all of our stakeholders. I know I have big shoes to fill, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months as we virtually hit the road. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our IR team, open up the call for questions. Thanks, Clarke. As you know, we've just launched GoDaddy Payments and we're seeing a good reaction from customers. They're excited, they're clicking on it, they're choosing the product. So it's a great, great start. Overall, our timing on commerce was about getting to the OmniCommerce solution later this year, next year is about marketing and experimentation with pricing. So you'll see us experiment with a lot of our models out there. And as we go through that, we're going to pick what's best for our customers and shareholders together. So no specific comment on various pricing strategies, but we've got to start and we're going to try a lot of stuff out. Thanks, Ygal. Continue to be super excited about the innovation in the domains business. As I've talked about last time as well, we're continuing to do more every quarter. And the goal here is to build the innovation factory, where we're the leader in this space and we're going to just continue to innovate. But we can only guide, what we see, we can't guide to sort of future innovation. But it's happening every quarter. Just this quarter, I talked about it in the prepared comments, we launched Buy-It-Now landers, and they've been adopted really, really well by our domain investor customers. So you'll continue to see us do it. It's just \u2013 when it comes to guidance, we'll talk about what we see and what we know. And in terms of presence, we continue to see fantastic growth in \u2013 in our growth products like Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. They're still outgrowing our overall business, even though they have some really tough comps year-over-year, so super excited about the work happening there as well. At a macro level, obviously we're all excited to have vaccine and be able to have a sense of normal, but these are unprecedented times. We don't really know how customer behavior is shifting. And my view always goes to whatever changes we see are short-term, long-term the opportunity in terms of online and offline coming together as massive. Our customers need to get out there, they need to sell everywhere. We're building a set of products, portfolio services that meet that need. We have a massive brand. So I'm just super bullish our opportunity long-term there. Thank you, Ron. And on commerce, as we've discussed, the strategy is about meeting a broad set of needs for our customers. And 2021 is the build here, we're moving very, very quickly. We've got payments out there. I talked about PayLinks, Virtual Terminal. We're going to have OmniCommerce by the end of the year. We're talking about invoicing for GoDaddy Pro. So a lot happening in the commerce space where we're looking at the customer need and we're bringing it out very quickly. 2022 is the year of experimentation. It's really too early right now to talk about what different things may happen there. We're going to go-to-market, there's a set of marketing experiments, set of experiments around pricing that we're going to be working on. And generally the initial reaction is from customers where they see our products and they want to work with GoDaddy on it. And in terms of Google or some of the Facebook announcements as well, what we're most excited about is creating a seamless and intuitive experience for our customers. For our customers to be able to go into one dashboard and manage systems, not just for their online store and with OmniCommerce there in store, but to be able to manage their spend on major platforms, all from the same place, all on look and feel seamless, intuitive, easy. That's what we're looking for. That's what we're most excited about. Thank you. Yes, the tradition in the industry has been for registrars to pass on that pricing. What's important about that with GoDaddy is that we have a segmented customer base and we take a nuanced approach to that pricing based on the type of customer. So we will be doing that the same strategy that we have done in the past. And I'll turn it to Mark to talk about the revenue. Hi. Yes, I can take that. On the pricing for other players, obviously I can't comment to what other companies are going to do, but obviously the historically you can look at what companies have done probably got a pretty good idea. On the registry business, continue to be really excited about what we can do there for the industry as a whole. As I talked about last quarter, our first goal there is to get to create a scale and you saw us do a few acquisitions. We announced 240 TLDs. Our goal is to have a certain scale where we can experiment with innovative ideas. We do have a few ideas and I've talked about one or two in the past, but where as we get closer to them and customers likely see them, I'd love for them to get out there and then we can talk about them more. Thanks, Naved for repeating the question. On subscriber accounts, we don't disclose that on a quarterly basis. So we'll share that with you at the end of the year and in terms of our commerce solutions, that part of Websites + Marketing customers continue to lean into that. We've continued to lean in and add more and more functionality. So that continues to do well for us. Yes, sure. Brent, thank you. On the pricing increase with Verisign, what I talked about was that we have a segment of strategy. So we have different types of customers and we changed pricing at different levels for them. Traditionally registrars have passed on the pricing from registries. So there is a pass on from us, but as Mark commented, that's been in our guide. But it's a segment in nuance approach. So I just want folks to understand that about the company as a whole. In terms of the second part of your question, sorry, what was the second part? Yes, sorry, there's little delay. In terms of the business apps growth that continues to be a function of customers' on boarding on our email products, both the Microsoft solution that we have and OX and us growing with our customers. But those customers do well are successful, is to see growth with them. We continue to be underpenetrated here. There's a ton of opportunity as we reach more and more customers as we make the experience. And what are there have been some on boarding improvements for customers that we've been able to do. We've come been able to continue to drive growth with existing customers and new customers there. Thank you all for joining. A quick thank you to all the GoDaddy employees for accelerating the innovation at the company and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor and happy to elaborate a bit. Let's start with \u2013 we're facing tough comps when it comes to some of our higher product growth, right? Websites + Marketing and things such as that I would also say, FX is not working in our favor in the second half where we assumed we will not have the same tailwinds. And we continue to see low growth in our hosting and security. So that coupled together kind of has put us today mid single digit growth for the year. I would also add we're being pretty prudent when it comes to looking at customer behaviour, especially as we get into the second half of the year. We just want to acknowledge there's a lot going on with our consumers. And we think this is the place to be right now. As far as the lapping in Q3 and Q4, we see part of it in Q3 and the bulk of it in Q4. Yes. Thanks. And I'll start with saying, a lot of the hosting and security is driven by traffic. And as in that particular area, we're monitoring the traffic very closely. We think it will continue with low digit growth throughout the year. We'll take a look at what the long-term prospects are. And I'll just start with or say, I'm looking forward to checking in with everybody six months from now and looking at the 2022 guidance as we put it forth. Aman, I'll jump onto that a bit. We continue to be really, really excited about the long-term prospects. But we've been prudent in the guidance, we're taking a look at the market. We're taking a look at the behavior and we'll continue to monitor for the short-term. Yes, thanks, Nick. I'll take that one. Really quick, obviously, we don't comment on ongoing M&A, but we will continue to look at opportunities that bring value to our customers. The one great thing about our balance sheet is, it gives us optionality to look at all sorts of deals. But we're not going to comment on anything currently. When it comes to partnerships, our ecosystem is extremely important. We will continue to look at that ecosystem and again, where it makes sense to partner with people in the market and everything is about the focus on the customer and bringing them value and ultimately strengthening that ecosystem. Thanks, Aman. And we have built this into the forecast. We had it in all along these things aren't unusual and as Aman mentioned, we've traditionally passed them on. So they are in the forecast for the second half. Thanks. And I'll take that one. We always look at capital allocation and as we've said in the script, our priority is around accelerating growth whether organically or through M&A having said that we will continue to look at share buyback and be opportunistic and provide value back to our shareholders where appropriate. I had a tough time hearing the question there. So I'm going to answer what I think was the second part, and then we might have do a repeat on the first part. I think you were asking for kind of directional guidance on the impact of e-commerce. I will tell you, well we're really, really excited about the launch of payments in the first half. And the launch of omni-commerce in the second half where we're not getting into the financial numbers, we're still looking at the impact on our customers. And if you could go back to the first question. Into that matter, if I didn't get the second question, right. Let me know. It was kind of in and out."

She co-chairs the National Asian Pacific Bar Association\u2019s In-House Counsel Mentoring Program and serves on the board of directors of the Asian Pacific Fund. Michele is talented and humble, experienced and curious, a strong cultural fit and will no doubt take us to the next level. Mark joins us from PWC where he led the U.S. Technology, Media, and Telecom Sector. Mark is a visionary, and a strategic leader who has developed a breadth of expertise, not just in finance, but across all of software and technology. He is a thought leader in the industry, and brings the depth of understanding that GoDaddy needs to wisely invest and drive growth.  One of the things that appealed to me about Mark is that he has been a strategic partner, directly advising CEOs and CFOs of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies, through important transitions. We are confident that Mark will be a fantastic addition to the strategic leadership of the company and together we will do great things. We wanted to take this opportunity to introduce Mark to you, here\u2019s Mark \nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. I'm very excited to be here today. GoDaddy has an incredible history of empowering small businesses and delivering great value for its customers. I was obviously attracted to the vision and mission of the company to radically change the global economy in favor of small businesses, but there is so much more to it.  The more I learned about Aman\u2019s strategic vision, the more I wanted to be a part of what\u2019s coming next on this journey. I\u2019m thrilled to be joining such an accomplished leadership team, and even more excited about what we\u2019re going to build in the future. I\u2019m anxious to dive in, and I look forward to meeting with many you on this call in the coming months.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark. Both Michele and Mark have connected very well with the existing leadership team and it is going to be fun working with them. We are grateful to have been in the position where a broad and diverse set of candidates were attracted to the GoDaddy story, and true to our commitment to velocity, we moved quickly and with purpose to fill the large shoes our existing leaders are leaving behind. Talking about moving quickly, our customers move quickly too. Our core focus has been about accelerating the velocity of innovation at GoDaddy. Ambitious goals and big ideas supported by operational discipline in the form of experimentation, both large and small. Last quarter I talked about three priorities for the year: Commerce, powered by our growth in presence, our focus on Pros and our domains business. With four consecutive quarters of accelerating bookings growth, today, I\u2019m delighted to share that in the last few months we brought to market new capabilities in all three of our priorities. Our top priority this year from a product perspective is commerce. As more and more of our customers are coming online with the explicit intent to sell products and services, we are rapidly innovating to meet those needs. Following our acquisition of Poynt in February, we have hit the ground running. We are live in market with payments functionality for WordPress and a beta launch of a seamless payments experience in websites plus marketing is coming in a few weeks. And our teams are running in parallel getting payments to market while continuing to make significant progress towards our true end goal, a holistic, omni-commerce solution, purpose-built by GoDaddy for the Everyday Entrepreneur to be launched this year. While we plan these significant improvements, our customers continue to succeed on our platform with GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite growing 100% year-over-year in Q1. Websites plus marketing commerce subscriptions also continue to stand out, increasing more than 70% year-over-year demonstrating the preference of our customers for our seamless and intuitive experience. We continue to see strong growth in websites plus marketing overall. Our customers look to us for help attracting their customers to effectively market their products and services. The plus marketing side of the suite is critical for customers, and I wanted to share four incredible new features to help our customers do exactly that, and do it in a simple way: First, we\u2019re excited to announce the launch of Facebook 'Boosted Posts', empowering GoDaddy customers to create and manage simple advertising campaigns on Facebook from within websites plus marketing. Our seamless and intuitive experience eliminates duplicated effort for our customers, and we take it further for them. With one click, our customers can turn their social media posts into email marketing campaigns. Second, through direct API integration with Instagram, GoDaddy customers can create, edit, post, and engage on Instagram directly from their websites plus marketing dashboard. Customers love this capability and we saw a 63% increase in account connections, and a 22% increase in weekly social posts after we introduced this feature. Third, we have a lot of service-based customers, like personal trainers or accountants, and they have unique needs. We launched a new Online Appointments Social Composer, which enables them to create posts to market their business and drive appointment bookings on their website through their social media channels. The result? Customers who used the social composer saw an average order per site and an average GMV per site increase by 20%. Last but not least, our brand is built on guidance and we have been working hard to bring guidance online. Recently, we embedded guidance directly into the editor. This personalized action plan leverages data from millions of websites and provides our customers with their next best action. About 20% percent of websites plus marketing customers have already engaged with this tool, and we saw an 86% increase in publication rates among those that did. Websites plus marketing has grown into a suite of products with capabilities that help customers succeed in all digital channels. We continue to get the product out to as many customers as possible with freemium, with marketing dollars and customers consistently tell us they want more. Moving to our second priority, Pros, we're pleased to share that last week, we hosted Expand 2021, our first ever conference for web designers and developers, or GoDaddy Pros. We created Expand to bring together the Pro community and share best practices and tools that will help them scale their business, get work done more efficiently, and keep clients happy.  We had thousands of Pros sign up for the event and early feedback is they absolutely loved it. Pros prefer the WordPress platform, and its success is clear from its market share gains. GoDaddy is committed to our Pros and to WordPress. We have a lot to offer Pros and I wanted to highlight a couple of recent releases: The first is the public beta launch of a new WordPress editor, optimized for ease-of-use and simplicity, making site building in WordPress easier than ever. We've been rolling out the new editor to new users quickly over the last couple of months. About half of the new users globally are now starting with the new editor and early indication is that their level of satisfaction is nicely higher than customers using the regular WordPress editor. The second is the Pro Hub. We talked about the launch of the Hub last quarter and now thousands of Pros are using it and using it frequently. Our target is to have over 300,000 pros enrolled and actively using the Hub by the end of the year. This is unique functionality for Pros, available for free, and every week the team launches new features and capabilities. The opportunity with Pros is huge. We're putting initiatives in place that will help us drive value for this important customer segment for many years. And, we're equally excited about the value created for GoDaddy and its shareholders as we tap more meaningfully into this market.  Moving onto Domains, last quarter I shared with you the acceleration of velocity we are seeing in experimentation in our Domains business and the innovation it is driving for our customers. The acceleration is a function of focusing on the customer needs, and when we provide customers with better products, they reward us with high engagement with our products, and higher revenue. It started showing up in our numbers meaningfully last quarter, and accelerated in Q1. The result in domains demonstrates the opportunities that exist for GoDaddy even in its most mature business. We are a two-sided marketplace for Domains, independent customers on one side and domain investors on the other. The high-teens growth in Domains is driven by innovation on connecting these customers and we will continue to innovate to drive these high levels of growth. I wanted to share a couple of examples of this with you: We created new experiences for Domain Investors that allowed them to quickly do bulk searches and orders. That simplified the day-to-day experiences for them. As domain investors engaged more, they added domains into the aftermarket, which we then pulled into new search experiences for independents, so they could have access to more inventory and find the right name for their venture. We also did the reverse; we gave independent customers an easy way to list their domain name in the aftermarket, a way that was seamless and custom-built for them. Independent customers added over 200,000 domain names that had otherwise been passive, into the aftermarket, spurring activity for Domain Investors. Creating these types of loops can quickly accelerate, and our team is reviewing every experience from basic parking to deep learning models, and testing improvements that add value to the customer and spur network effects. One such opportunity that we will bring to bear is with our GoDaddy Registry business. A few weeks ago, we announced some small acquisitions, with big aspirations. We're adding about 30 new TLDs to GoDaddy Registry, including .club, .design, and the MMX portfolio. The efficiencies of scale make obvious sense and the reason for us to scale GoDaddy Registry is to be able to innovate for our customers. Following the acquisitions that we\u2019ve announced, GoDaddy will be the third-largest registry in the world, and our platform allows us to add TLDs at near-zero incremental cost. The high-margin business gives us investment dollars, while keeping costs low. This is key to us creating new experiences for customers, while giving them a choice of the best TLDs, both from our partners and from GoDaddy. In closing, as we have shared in the past, our formula for success, first and foremost, is about creating value for our customers. Our operating velocity is about innovation driving a constant increase in customer value allowing us to shift part of the value to shareholders. GoDaddy had a strong quarter, powered by a good acceleration in bookings. And yes, our strong business model showed up, and yes, we flexed our organic and inorganic muscles for growth, and yes, we invested in our products and marketing while delivering healthy unlevered free cash flow, but the key to long-term growth and value creation remains that we are a customer-led software company focused on innovation for our customers, and our customers continue to want to do more with us. With that, let's hear from Ray now, in what will be his last quarterly call for GoDaddy. Thank you, Ray.\nRay Winborne: Thanks Aman, I\u2019ll touch on the financial results for what was a terrific quarter for GoDaddy, and then provide our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. Q1 is another solid proof point validating the strategy we laid out last year at our Investor Day. We've now seen four consecutive quarters of accelerating bookings growth, and the teams are pushing harder every day to increase velocity in innovation, giving us confidence we're just beginning to tap the huge opportunity in front of us. For the quarter, total revenue came in at $901 million, growing over 14% year-over-year, while currency impacts were negligible. Our international business grew 16% on a reported basis. That\u2019s the fastest growth in over two years as we see ever increasing demand for digital presence in markets around the world. Business applications was our fastest growing product line, increasing 21% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. And, Domains was not far behind, growing 19% on the heels of the experimentation efforts Aman talked about earlier.  We continue to see stellar growth in aftermarket domain sales. With over 20 million domains listed, GoDaddy operates the largest and most active domain aftermarket in the world, and it now contributes roughly 10% of total revenue. We also continue to see great strength in primary domain registrations and strong product renewal rates. And finally, hosting and presence grew little over 4% in the first quarter. This line continues to reflect headwinds from the GoDaddy social product due to the elimination of the outbound sales motion last June. Putting some context on that impact, excluding GoDaddy social, from both periods, growth in hosting and presence would have been high-single digits this quarter. We marked a major milestone from the scale perspective this quarter. For the first time ever, GoDaddy is reporting quarterly bookings of more than a billion dollars. Bookings rose 14% year-over-year with a point of currency tailwind. Strength was broad-based across products and geographies, with domains seeing the most upside. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter. As we've shared with you in the past, there are many variables that can impact gross margin in any given quarter, but product mix is one of the most important. Outsized growth in domains impacted overall gross margins this quarter, but we remain within the mid-60s range we've always pointed to. More importantly, we're pleased with the growth in gross profit dollars generated by the top line out performance this quarter. Both G&A and tech and dev expenses accelerated this quarter, primarily related to acquisition expenses pre and post-consolidation. Importantly, our acquisition of Poynt in February required us to account for some of the acquisition price as GAAP operating expenses, which we call out in the reconciliation tables in the press release and slides.  Excluding these non-recurring expenses, tech and dev expense would have been lower by $29 million, but still up nearly 20% year-over-year, as we press to accelerate product development. We also continued to invest in marketing to capture strong demand in the market. The net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $192 million in Q1, representing growth of 17%. Moving to cash flow, unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $268 million, growing 14%, partially from lighter CapEx spend this quarter that should even itself out over the remainder of the year. Now, onto the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $1.3 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.9 billion. In February, we issued $800 million eight-year senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 3.5% to fund acquisition activity. We also took advantage of favorable market conditions, repricing the 2027 term loan lowering the rate by 50 basis points and generating nearly $4 million in annual cash savings. Net debt stands at $2.7 billion, below 3 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the mid-point of our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. Additionally, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our common stock through today, for an aggregate purchase price of $276 million or an average price of just under $79 per share. These repurchases represent approximately 2% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. We also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to acquire an incremental $775 million of our common stock, bringing the total repurchase capacity to $1 billion. GoDaddy has a highly resilient, recurring revenue model, and a strong balance sheet. This enables us to execute against a number of priorities as you saw this quarter, including investing for organic growth, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the liquidity and flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities in pursuit of long-term growth and free cash flow per share. With that, let's turn to our outlook. Given the strong pacing of the business, we\u2019re raising our guidance for full-year revenue to $3.75 billion, or 13% growth, and we're also raising the outlook for unlevered free cash flow to $955 million or 16% growth. With respect to investment cadence, we're seeing good returns on marketing spend, and plan to continue at similar levels of investment to drive growth.  We also expect continued tech and dev investment as we push on the velocity and scope of our product development, including the launch of an omni-commerce offering. These investments will be largely offset by the operating leverage we're seeing in customer care and G&A. For Q2, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, or 14% growth year-over-year, with high-teens growth in domains and business applications, and high-single-digit growth in hosting and presence. Note that this updated guidance reflects $20 million of revenue and $20 million of unlevered free cash flow dilution from the Poynt acquisition and does not incorporate the impact of any of the recently announced registry deals. We continue to expect Poynt to contribute more than $150 million in incremental bookings to our commerce solution in 2023. In closing, 2021 has been strong out of the gate, exceeding our expectations and we\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019re playing offense in a world where a digital presence is now table stakes and commerce continues to evolve quickly. GoDaddy will lead in this space by providing differentiated customer experiences, growth opportunities for its employees and creating significant value for shareholders. With that, well Christie Masoner from our IR team open up the call for questions.\nA- Christie Masoner: Thanks, Ray. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Sterling, please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: All right, great, can you hear me, okay.\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nSterling Auty: All right. Ray, congratulations on finishing up your tenure at GoDaddy on such a high note, but I am wondering how happy Mark is with you raising guidance before you step-out the door?\nRay Winborne: Thanks Sterling. Appreciate it. It was a fantastic quarter. Happy with where the business is \u2013 the trajectory of it.\nSterling Auty: So maybe you can help us out a couple of fronts. I think maybe the one that is still drilling in, you mentioned the headwinds and hosting and presence, when did those headwinds abate? And where logically should the growth in that business go? As it kind of gets back to a more normalized run rate? \nRay Winborne: Yeah, thanks for that question Sterling. It's one we get pretty commonly. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, ex-social, the hosting and presence line grew in the high-single-digits in the first quarter. And the guide on a forward basis is continued growth in that range, rest of the year obviously implies an acceleration as you move through. Gosh we've been super happy with what we're seeing in those subscription software products that we've talked about. And we really did start to see continued strong growth there. Aman highlighted a lot of the progress we're seeing from a commerce perspective. So, there's upside from here. The fact remains that traditional hosting and security products still make up a large percentage of that line item. I think the thing as an investor, we should look at and remember is that these products are critical to the success of our partner audience, right, who serve entrepreneurs. And while they're a little slower growing, they are super stable businesses, their cash generative, and they support the investments we\u2019re making in those software centric offerings like websites plus market, manage WordPress, over [sell bright] and now with the introduction of omni-commerce later this year. All those investments are being funded by us and the create and grow phase of the customer journey, we've highlighted this, you've seen in the investor deck, right? That's $175 billion TAM, huge opportunity for us. As these offerings continue to scale, we add capabilities. We do expect that to be a tailwind to the hosting and presence growth as we move forward.\nSterling Auty: That makes sense. And then maybe one follow up on the domain side, with the new mix with the registry operations in there, no longer does this look like a segment that's going to grow in-line with customer growth the way that it's been articulated in the past? How should we think about the sustainability of what type of growth rate and domains as we move forward?\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Sterling, this is Aman. Maybe I'll start and Ray can jump in. You know, the story here and of course, there's, you know, growth from the primary market, we're seeing sort of new demand customers coming in, but the outsized growth in the aftermarket as well, and there's good demand there. But the real story here is about innovation, right? We want to increase the pace of innovation at the company, we've put that energy into the domain side, and you're seeing the results of that, you know, as we continue to improve the product, we've seen more inventory, basically more domains going to the aftermarket. And on both sides, independence and domain investors, sort of taking advantage of that. You know, our view is that we'll continue to innovate, to look for opportunities, sort of on every [road], to improve the customer experience. And, you know, the innovation will continue to drive growth for the company. You know, in terms of sustainability, you know, we like to think that we're making changes that make the growth durable, but of course, you know, as we've said, before, that we started to see some goodness in Q4 of last year. So, we're going to have to continue to innovate to sort of continue to drive growth. So, I'll turn it to Ray to add a bit more color.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, just adding a little bit to that, Sterling. You could think of the driver of that 5 points or sequential acceleration in the domains line item as being a lot of the aftermarket, right. So, Aman mentioned and we feel good about the systemic changes we're making in the product in the flows. So, we do expect the dollars to continue to drive meaningful growth as we move forward. That said, we do anticipate the domains growth rates to moderate to the, you know, low-double digits rate by the end of the year.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nRay Winborne: You bet.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of [Jan Lee] from Evercore ISI. [Jan], please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you guys and congrats on the quarter. So, this is Jan for Mark Mahaney. I guess maybe \u2013 one more question on websites and marketing, if you could put some color around just the overall web and marketing growth compared to prior quarters as the revenue base for W plus M plus continues to work to grow. And also like, what's the cadence of the freemium rollout? Where are we in terms of like the U.S. rolled out? And if you could put some color on the conversion?\nAman Bhutani : Yeah, let me take the last bit of that first, this is Aman, Jan. In terms of the freemium rollout, we continue to be super happy with the rollout. Majority of customers in the U.S. are now seeing the freemium product. We are still gathering the last bits of data on it, but we are satisfied from a conversion standpoint that it is doing better than free trial, and it's going to be the way forward for us. Our path there, the next steps there will be about taking freemium into other English speaking markets, and then our other international markets. So that's, sort of the roadmap for freemium moving forward. And in terms of the comparison, year-over-years, I\u2019ll turn it to Ray.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, Jan. The rates on those products, the growth rates are consistent with what we've been talking about in recent quarters continue to be really happy with both attach we're seeing there, as well as the skews that folks are choosing.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if I may add one more question on just the Poynt, going out a couple of years, I know you talked about, you know, 150 million by 2023, what kind of assumptions are you using in terms of just the GMV capture? How much of that GMV do you expect to be flowing through Poynt at that time?\nRay Winborne: That's it. Those are conservative, right. I don\u2019t want to get into the details yet, because we're still a good ways out from actually launching that iterating on the go to market, whether it's new versus existing. So, there's going to be a lot of factors to consider as we roll that product out. But 150 is the minimum we're looking at. We think there's a lot more opportunity beyond that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you guys.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, could you just maybe give an update on quarter-to-date trends as kind of COVID concerns and uncertainty persists? And then the second question is maybe bigger picture, is roll-out new features for social API integrations with Instagram, things like that? What is the level of the, kind of the current sub base awareness of these roll-outs that are, you know, pretty frequent? And then, you know, how does this come into play with winning new subs who are in market to choose a platform and maybe in particular, the e-commerce solutions at GoDaddy? Thanks.\nRay Winborne: Hey, Nick, let me take the first one and then Aman can hit on the product. As far as trajectory, we continue to see really strong year-over-year growth in new customer cohorts. That\u2019s both in the number of customers and in the absolute dollar value of the cohort. If you look at the first quarter cohort, you know, it's comparable to what the size is, we were seeing the Q2, Q3 last year, when the COVID demand surged. You know, we are seeing differences in demand around the world, just like we have for the last year, but the numbers are still really strong, as you can see in the results and in the guide. And this is consistent with what you're seeing in a lot of the other external data points with respect to small businesses, including, you know, instilling real robust new business formation in the U.S., in particular. The Q2 guide that we put out there, as well as the full-year, you know, is what we see with respect to current trajectory.\nAman Bhutani: And then, in terms of the feature set, Nick, you know, it's all about very, very quickly bringing features to market that create value for customers, that increases their engagement, that increases their customer success, right. That drives awareness \u2013 that success for them drives sort of the awareness of the product, not just with them, but with other people. And you know, the beautiful word of mouth that continues there.  But internally, what it does is that customer success leads to us being able to build an ecosystem of upsell, be able to build an ecosystem where they're able to adopt new and new capability, and we're able to offer them more. And then we're able to bring that success to, sort of earlier in the sales path where we can use that messaging in terms of confidence to say, you know, ex-percent of customers are using this, you should try to, you can get it with this starter package of websites plus marketing. Hopefully, that answers a little bit of, I think, the question that you were asking. And there's just a ton of opportunity for us to drive awareness about our product, you know, I look at a lot of research where customers are just surprised to see how simple and intuitive and kind of powerful websites plus marketing is for their needs, but they just didn't know that it existed or that it did [X, Y, Z] and us continuing to launch those features, you know, just makes it very, very big.  And then quick mention on the Pro side, you know, this is why we did the expand program. You know, we have a new editor in play for WordPress, we've launched the hub. And we've got to get word out there that GoDaddy is bringing to the table new feature set functionality, you know, a huge amount of it for free, that can really make life easier for the Pros. And you know, so far they're liking what they're seeing.\nNick Jones : Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: The next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Can you comment on how you think you can monetize the boosted posts for Facebook, as well as the Instagram API, and do you have any of preliminary stats on customer adoption? And then Aman, you had noted targeting, I think 300,000 Pros enrolled in pro hub by year-end, that's probably about 20% penetration. Where do we stand today, knowing that it's, you know, still very early days? And just what's going to drive that, you know, adoption? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, it's super early days. And, you know, I've mentioned a couple of metrics for some of the features, you know, where we have a little bit more data, and no doubt for things like boosted posts, and others. We'll see, I think, really, really good engagement from our customers on those. In terms of engagement with the hub, the 300,000 number comes from looking at our basic customers, as you know we have 1.5 million Pros on our platform, which is just a massive number. But to engage them at a much deeper level, you know our \u2013 what we did is we segmented those customers.  And we said, look, here are the types of sub segments within those that could really benefit from a tool like the hub, and those are the customers we're targeting, you're going to see us, sort of reach out to them with sort of innovative marketing solutions, that bring them to the hub that allow them to try tools and then sort of add value to it every week, literally every week, every other week we put something out there.  So that, you know, if you go to the hub today, for example, you know, one of the things we have out there is more data for them for their websites that we're capturing, and you'll see some data set, and then you'll see right in front of it coming soon, you know, on the next thing. So that they, they feel that the velocity of change that they feel that, okay, I'm seeing this today, and I'm going to have something in a week or two, and I need to come back together. So that that's the type of loop we're trying to create to bring 300,000 folks into the hub.\nRay Winborne: Hey, Trevor, when you think about monetization on those websites plus marketing capabilities, right, we're focused on delivering that customer value first, then we'll get to monetization once we've gotten that closer to scale.\nTrevor Young: Great, thank you both and congrats Ray on leaving on a strong mark.\nRay Winborne: I appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner: The next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead. \nRon Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. Always good to talk to you. So, I wanted to ask maybe two on, Aman on payments and the commerce solution, you know, you talked about getting both ready to market, I guess payment trading market and the end goal the omni-commerce solution launching here. Websites and marketing commerce, I think subscriptions or subs rose 70% year-over-year. And so can you talk to us maybe how GoDaddy looks once these solutions are fully launched and really what we can expect around building awareness given your commentary of new products and services are being launched. But awareness is still something that's being worked on? And then maybe another question more just on the organization, with things reopening now, are the [guides] back in the office and just wondering how the organization if folks are back in the office, how that's coming along from just an efficiency perspective? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, happy to take that. On the payments piece, you know, we have a WordPress solution out there. That's a small start, because we're trying to see, you know how things work and push through things through the pipe. But the big launch, as you said, you know, is about websites plus marketing and having a completely seamless experience. The way I'd want you to visualize that is, you know, customer comes to us, they start with a website or a domain, ultimately they have an online, store online. And as they're picking their payments provider, they have a clean default choice that says, you know, started with GoDaddy payments. And it just works seamlessly every interface they go into looks the same, feels the same, works the same way, is connected in the background.  So, they are not copy pasting anything, you know, everything related to their, sort of selling capability, whether it's in, you know, it's on their side or with partners like Amazon, or Etsy or others is handled seamlessly and just taken care of. And of course, the omni-commerce solution, which we're committed to launching this year, is about bringing the capability of in-store into that same ecosystem as well. You know, outside of that, we're also targeting managed WordPress, which is our instance of WordPress and GoDaddy payment solution for managed WordPress, which we will also be launching in a few weeks. You know, as we put those pieces together, the point about awareness, of course, continues to become bigger and bigger. But once we have a full solution, we can actually go to market in a different way.  We can actually go to market and talk to customers about having the full capability of them being able to do it in the manner that they like to do it with GoDaddy, where the solutions are simple, the technology is intuitive, and the human guidance is always, always available to them. So that's what you should expect from us. In terms of reopening, we are still evaluating reopening, you know like many other companies, we have done some surveys of the employee base, we have put in some dates where, you know, we're going to incur what \u2013 ask folks to come in on a volunteer basis.  And so far, there's not a lot of folks taking us up on that. I think folks continue to be concerned. I think, folks, in many places \u2013 and it depends on country, as you well know, obviously the situation in India, very, very difficult right now, but depending on country, you know, there are some locations where people are slightly more open to it. But at this point, we think it's looking more like later in the summer that we'll have a set of folks back in the office.\nRon Josey: And maybe from a productivity perspective, we\u2019re now a year, call it three quarters in of the guides working from home. Maybe improvements there. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, you know, we're happy with the productivity that we've continued to add more sort of tech, we've continued to add more capability for the guides to work remotely because we realize that this is, sort of a new normal for quite a bit. So far, we're pretty happy with the productivity. We start to lap some of that, you know, going into April and May here. So, so far, we're pretty happy with it.\nRon Josey: Got it. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner : The next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler & Co. Brent, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hi. This is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. First question, certainly top of mind is that 19% domain\u2019s growth number, highest in three years with a high teens guide. And Ray, I appreciate the disclosure around percentage of the business from aftermarket. Could you maybe give us a sense of what percentage of the business aftermarket was a year ago or in the past? And maybe how much volumes versus ASPs are driving the benefit today? And I have one follow-up. Thanks.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, Clarke, yeah, we've been disclosing for a while at single-digit. And now it's climbed up to double-digit, we've been really happy with all the work the team's been putting in place and Aman articulated a lot of the things we're doing. It's not just one thing. It's different purchase passes, it\u2019s different [UX] on it. And it's more inventory in the pipe. So, the lift there has been really strong. And you saw that 5 point difference on the sequential that you just talked about. From a unit versus ASP perspective, this is primarily unit, right. These are more inventory going through the pipe versus higher ASPs. Now, we do see our share of strong ASPs, you know, six digit plus numbers, but that's not what's driving the revenue growth.\nClarke Jeffries : Alright, perfect. And then second question, you know, obviously strong global demand seen with 16% growth in international. But I was wondering if we could get a little bit more detail about where you're seeing strength in the different regions, any pockets of particular strength to call out? And then, is there any, you know, takeaway for investors, with this being a third of the business and now growing faster than overall revenue?\nRay Winborne : Yeah, fantastic results out of the international team. They've really stepped up during the COVID demand surge, particularly in the marketing side. If you look at some of the campaigns that we put out there in different markets, it's really driving a lot of sign-ups. As far as any areas of strength, our developed markets are growing incredibly strong. So Canada, Australia, UK, India, those all sequentially stepped up. And we've been really happy with the results we're seeing there.\nClarke Jeffries : Perfect. Thank you very much.\nRay Winborne : You bet.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, I actually thought that one of the most important things you said on the call so far today is just that the cohorts, the 1Q cohort is comparable to 2Q and 3Q last year, and I think that's an incredibly positive sign. So, I wanted to dig into that a little bit. Maybe you could, if there's anything around core behavior, you know, where they're coming into the funnels at around domains. You know, is it more on the website sales marketing side? Is it manage WordPress, is the Pro push helping push that and some of those behaviors? So, just some color around that. And then, on the hosting side, I know, it's \u2013 there's lot of grown piece and not the fanciest part of the business, but remains important. Are there opportunities to grow that business? And are you seeing pressure there from the larger cloud providers taking share in the market? Or do you guys not really play in the same ballpark?\nAman Bhutani: Ygal, thanks for the question. You know, on the cohorts, as Ray said, Q1 came in as a strong cohort, and definitely behaving similar to the Q2, Q3 cohorts, so, we \u2013 that he talked about. I think, overall, that's great customer numbers. They're coming in through similar channels. You know, as an example, you talked about Pros, you know the stuff we're talking about Pros is still early. So, what you are going to expect is the channels are pretty similar. And it's similar to what we saw through the pandemic last year. So, there isn't a lot of, sort of change in terms of the shape. It's just nice increase, continued nice increase in customer numbers, and just more going through the pipe. And then on the second piece, I'll let Ray take it.\nRay Winborne: Yeah, Ygal, so as far as competition, right, there is some consolidation taking place in hosting, but we are very sharply priced on our offering. And the Pro hub is another way we're enhancing the benefit for those folks that are coming in and using that product.\nYgal Arounian : Great and thanks for taking the questions.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Deepak, please go ahead. Deepak, please un-mute your line. We will move on to the next question coming from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Ray. Congrats on a great run.\nRay Winborne: Thanks, Brent.\nBrent Thill: When you think about the cash flow, it was about 11% ahead of the street. And I'm just curious, nice to see the commitment to the buyback, but also questions around, you know, you've done some great tuck-ins with Poynt and others, you know, your commitment on that side, too, and how you're going to balance the buyback versus overall tuck-ins to solidify their tech platform.\nRay Winborne : You got a question there, Brent or are you making a comment?\nBrent Thill: No, I'm just curious when you think about the mix and how you're incorporating that, it was nice to see the commitment to the buyback. But I was just curious if you can comment, as it relates to M&A, and part of the strategy going forward. You've done some nice tuck-ins like Poynt, you know, should we continue to expect that going forward? How you think about capital allocation?\nRay Winborne: Gosh, is the beauty of this business model, right. Significant and predictable cash flow generation, we can execute across all of the capital allocation priorities, right, whether that's organic M&A, and share repurchases. To your point, we've made a string of acquisitions over the last 18 months that have added significant product capability, some incredible talent, and some strategic optionality. When you think about registering that, virtualization there, you know, since the last earnings call, 2% of our outstanding equity at really attractive prices, because we were able to take advantage of the market volatility. And honestly, when you look at capital allocation for us, it's pretty easy where net leverage is near the midpoint leaves us a whole turn of EBITDA in capacity there. But those priorities in the order don't change, right. We're going to invest prudently, but at an accelerated rate in the organic business, M&A, we've got a strong pipeline, and it will continue to be opportunistic, with that billion dollars of capacity we've got on repurchases.\nBrent Thill: Okay, excellent. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask another question on the Pro hub product, maybe if my understanding is incorrect, but I think that it's free for professionals to sign up for the product and that you can actually use it to manage WordPress websites that aren't created on GoDaddy. So, maybe just, sort of be helpful if you could dig into the monetization model and strategy with the Pro hub?\nAman Bhutani : Yes, for sure, Matt. So the approach here is very much aligned with our broader approach as a company. The idea is to build tools and capabilities that add value to the customer drive engagement, drive value, right, over time, take some of that value and shift it to shareholders, right. Absolutely the Pro hub is a fantastic tool that not only helps Pros come in and manage WordPress instances, you know, both hosted at GoDaddy and outside. But it also gives them a place where they can do a bit of project management or manage their clients. And we're adding more and more capabilities to it. The idea is to create value for the Pro. As an example, we already know that just the pros that are using it right now are saying that they can save about three hours per site rate per month, already with just what we have today. So, as we save those Pros time, we expect to have a bigger part of their business with GoDaddy. And it forms a great starting point for us to be able to put in front of them, you know, new capabilities, new products, because they have a high engagement product that they come to all the time that they \u2013 it creates value for them, and gives us the opportunity to now expose them to products that we monetize.\nMatt Pfau: Got it and just one follow-up on that, within your Pro base are you seeing, you know, similar uptake or interest in launching commerce sites that you're seeing in the websites plus marketing business?\nAman Bhutani : I think we're very early in that space. We know that Pros are super interested in commerce, we know that WooCommerce supports a huge percentage of the online e-commerce sort of GMV today. So, we know there's great demand there. We know there's a strong community behind it. But we're still pretty early in that process. As you'll remember, in Q4, last year, we did an acquisition called SkyVerge, so we now have a team that is dedicated to WooCommerce. They're part of the overall commerce division, which as you know, is led by Osama Bedier, who joined us from Poynt. So, we're actually bringing all the different pieces together at the company and saying here's the commerce division they are going to deliver a platform that works across websites plus marketing and manage WordPress.\nMatt Pfau : Thanks, guys, appreciate it.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious to know if the 70% growth in the websites plus marketing and Sellbrite is comparable to what we have been seen in the last few quarters? Or is there is a pickup or about the same? And also maybe, if you can give some color on the mix of e-commerce packages within that that would be great?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, sorry, I can take that. Overall, you know, the growth we talked about was all commerce across, you know, websites plus marketing suite. So, that grew 70%, year-over-year and it's \u2013 if I remember right, well consistent with what we've talked about. We've consistently seen that skew grow, you know, faster than the other skews. And I think it matches the demand we have in the market today, right. Customers are coming online, they're looking for an online store, you also saw us shift, I think I talked about it in the previous call some of our merchandising, where you come to the homepage of GoDaddy, and unless we already know you and personalize it, what we put right in front of you is the ability to build an online store with websites plus marketing. In terms of the percentages, you know, going into the commerce skew versus others, broadly in line with what we've talked to you about, you know, it continues to be the product that customers are excited about. It continues to be the product that we're putting a lot in. And it's not just about product commerce, as I've talked in my prepared remarks. We're doing more and more first services commerce customers, as well. And their needs are unique and different. What they're looking for is tools that help them do the online appointment and sort of, you know things that go along with that. So, you know, overall, I would say the similar trend, but hopefully that little bit of color helps.\nNaved Khan: That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow up. On the payment front, at what point you think maybe you can start to maybe share some numbers that you know that you think you can be generating, either in the back half or maybe for 2022? And also, with respect to your own expectations, how are you tracking with the launch or integrating point into the online packages?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. We continue to be very happy with the Poynt integration, we're moving very aggressively the products that we're building and testing right now. And as I said, you know, we've got something out there for WordPress already. And you'll see more from us in websites plus marketing within a few weeks. You know, from my perspective, they\u2019ll look fantastic. It's exactly, sort of seamless, intuitive experience that our customer base needs and we're absolutely excited about providing that.  We're still on track to provide an omni-commerce solution. This year, our teams are working in parallel and burning the [midnight] on that, you know, we're all super excited about it. We think it's going to make a difference in the market. And bringing, sort of in-store, online, and platforms, Amazon, Etsy, all of those sales together in one place bundled with commerce, with payments, and honestly more opportunities coming right behind the invoicing and others.  We think it's just fantastic. But overall in terms of talking about numbers a bit too early. And as Ray said, we have a number out there for 2023, and, you know, we think it's conservative because we really think the opportunity is very large.\nNaved Khan: Makes sense, thank you.\nAman Bhutani : Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Volpe from Wolfe Research. Frank, please go ahead.\nFrank Volpe: Hi, everyone, Frank Volpe here for Deepak. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just wanted to ask you about the [indiscernible] business, obviously acquired more extensions. Before you spoke a lot about innovation being central to your strategy, I am just curious to know if you could highlight kind of what which innovations you're most excited about, as well as how we should think about timing, to building our business here larger?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, one of the things we realize is, you know, to innovate, we needed a bit more scale in that business. We need more TLDs. We need to be able to give the customer more choice. So, what you see here is us adding a bit of scale and of course there's some financial advantages to that too, but adding a bit of scale so that we can really drive a more innovative experience for our customers. Believe me we're doing some small things there and as soon as we have something that we're super excited about, you guys will hear about it.\nFrank Volpe: Absolutely.\nRay Winborne: Hey Frank [indiscernible] we picked up right? Those are either owned or perpetual contract TLDs, meaning zero incremental costs. [Indiscernible].\nFrank Volpe: Got it. And then just as a follow up, you know, we also struggled with that websites and marketing, as we, you know, coming out of the pandemic, and things are starting to reopen. Have you guys seen any kind of impact on customer acquisition costs, or any kind of \u2013 anything notable, we should be thinking about in terms of your marketing channels?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, I think, you know, as we talked about a little bit, the Q1 cohort was a strong cohort. And, you know, we'll continue to spend in marketing till we see the returns. And as Ray guided, you know, right now, we intend to continue to spend in marketing as best as we can see today. We see good returns for that marketing spend, or at least well within our guidelines. So that's what we're expecting to do. Obviously, there's no crystal ball and I can't talk about what's going to happen. But overall, we still feel pretty good about it.\nFrank Volpe: Right. So, no impact yet is what I'm hearing.\nRay Winborne: No. In fact, as I mentioned, that first quarter cohort looked a lot like the size of the Q2, Q3 last year, so\u2026\nFrank Volpe: All right, perfect. Thanks to everyone and regulations on the great quarter.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nRay Winborne: Appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner: Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to turn the call over to Aman for some closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. I wanted to take just a moment to thank Nima Kelly and Ray Winborne. Nima has been the backbone of this company for almost 20 years and her contribution is immeasurable. You know, I know this group doesn't get to see her, but Nima is always in the background with us on these calls and always helping out and has done so much for the company. And Ray, you know, just, you guys get to see him all the time, total joy to work with, such a professional. And Ray, I'm really glad you get to go out on a [beaten race], and Sterling joke, which Sterling you gave me a big laugh. You know that this is a good point to hand off to Mark for sure. So, thank you, Nima and Ray and thank you all GoDaddy employees for a great quarter and thanks to you all for joining the call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy exists to empower Everyday Entrepreneurs. We remain committed to a vision that can change the world, and radically shift the global economy in favor of small business. The internet has emerged as the greatest technological equalizer and every day more entrepreneurs are seizing that promised opportunity and making their own way. And we are thrilled to support them in their journey. Today, we are also pleased to announce that Michele Lau and Mark McCaffrey will be joining GoDaddy as our new Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. As we charge down the path of growth, Michele and Mark bring scale and experience to our already strong leadership team. Michele joins us from McKesson where she advises its board and senior executives on strategic matters related to M&A, corporate strategy, executive compensation, corporate governance, the McKesson Foundation and so much more. She co-chairs the National Asian Pacific Bar Association's In-House Counsel Mentoring Program and serves on the board of directors of the Asian Pacific Fund. Michele is talented and humble, experienced and curious, a strong cultural fit and will no doubt take us to the next level. Mark joins us from PWC where he led the U.S. Technology, Media, and Telecom Sector. Mark is a visionary, and a strategic leader who has developed a breadth of expertise, not just in finance, but across all of software and technology. He is a thought leader in the industry, and brings the depth of understanding that GoDaddy needs to wisely invest and drive growth.  One of the things that appealed to me about Mark is that he has been a strategic partner, directly advising CEOs and CFOs of the world's greatest tech companies, through important transitions. We are confident that Mark will be a fantastic addition to the strategic leadership of the company and together we will do great things. We wanted to take this opportunity to introduce Mark to you, here's Mark Thank you, Mark. Both Michele and Mark have connected very well with the existing leadership team and it is going to be fun working with them. We are grateful to have been in the position where a broad and diverse set of candidates were attracted to the GoDaddy story, and true to our commitment to velocity, we moved quickly and with purpose to fill the large shoes our existing leaders are leaving behind. Talking about moving quickly, our customers move quickly too. Our core focus has been about accelerating the velocity of innovation at GoDaddy. Ambitious goals and big ideas supported by operational discipline in the form of experimentation, both large and small. Last quarter I talked about three priorities for the year: Commerce, powered by our growth in presence, our focus on Pros and our domains business. With four consecutive quarters of accelerating bookings growth, today, I'm delighted to share that in the last few months we brought to market new capabilities in all three of our priorities. Our top priority this year from a product perspective is commerce. As more and more of our customers are coming online with the explicit intent to sell products and services, we are rapidly innovating to meet those needs. Following our acquisition of Poynt in February, we have hit the ground running. We are live in market with payments functionality for WordPress and a beta launch of a seamless payments experience in websites plus marketing is coming in a few weeks. And our teams are running in parallel getting payments to market while continuing to make significant progress towards our true end goal, a holistic, omni-commerce solution, purpose-built by GoDaddy for the Everyday Entrepreneur to be launched this year. While we plan these significant improvements, our customers continue to succeed on our platform with GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite growing 100% year-over-year in Q1. Websites plus marketing commerce subscriptions also continue to stand out, increasing more than 70% year-over-year demonstrating the preference of our customers for our seamless and intuitive experience. We continue to see strong growth in websites plus marketing overall. Our customers look to us for help attracting their customers to effectively market their products and services. The plus marketing side of the suite is critical for customers, and I wanted to share four incredible new features to help our customers do exactly that, and do it in a simple way: First, we're excited to announce the launch of Facebook 'Boosted Posts', empowering GoDaddy customers to create and manage simple advertising campaigns on Facebook from within websites plus marketing. Our seamless and intuitive experience eliminates duplicated effort for our customers, and we take it further for them. With one click, our customers can turn their social media posts into email marketing campaigns. Second, through direct API integration with Instagram, GoDaddy customers can create, edit, post, and engage on Instagram directly from their websites plus marketing dashboard. Customers love this capability and we saw a 63% increase in account connections, and a 22% increase in weekly social posts after we introduced this feature. Third, we have a lot of service-based customers, like personal trainers or accountants, and they have unique needs. We launched a new Online Appointments Social Composer, which enables them to create posts to market their business and drive appointment bookings on their website through their social media channels. The result? Customers who used the social composer saw an average order per site and an average GMV per site increase by 20%. Last but not least, our brand is built on guidance and we have been working hard to bring guidance online. Recently, we embedded guidance directly into the editor. This personalized action plan leverages data from millions of websites and provides our customers with their next best action. About 20% percent of websites plus marketing customers have already engaged with this tool, and we saw an 86% increase in publication rates among those that did. Websites plus marketing has grown into a suite of products with capabilities that help customers succeed in all digital channels. We continue to get the product out to as many customers as possible with freemium, with marketing dollars and customers consistently tell us they want more. Moving to our second priority, Pros, we're pleased to share that last week, we hosted Expand 2021, our first ever conference for web designers and developers, or GoDaddy Pros. We created Expand to bring together the Pro community and share best practices and tools that will help them scale their business, get work done more efficiently, and keep clients happy.  We had thousands of Pros sign up for the event and early feedback is they absolutely loved it. Pros prefer the WordPress platform, and its success is clear from its market share gains. GoDaddy is committed to our Pros and to WordPress. We have a lot to offer Pros and I wanted to highlight a couple of recent releases: The first is the public beta launch of a new WordPress editor, optimized for ease-of-use and simplicity, making site building in WordPress easier than ever. We've been rolling out the new editor to new users quickly over the last couple of months. About half of the new users globally are now starting with the new editor and early indication is that their level of satisfaction is nicely higher than customers using the regular WordPress editor. The second is the Pro Hub. We talked about the launch of the Hub last quarter and now thousands of Pros are using it and using it frequently. Our target is to have over 300,000 pros enrolled and actively using the Hub by the end of the year. This is unique functionality for Pros, available for free, and every week the team launches new features and capabilities. The opportunity with Pros is huge. We're putting initiatives in place that will help us drive value for this important customer segment for many years. And, we're equally excited about the value created for GoDaddy and its shareholders as we tap more meaningfully into this market.  Moving onto Domains, last quarter I shared with you the acceleration of velocity we are seeing in experimentation in our Domains business and the innovation it is driving for our customers. The acceleration is a function of focusing on the customer needs, and when we provide customers with better products, they reward us with high engagement with our products, and higher revenue. It started showing up in our numbers meaningfully last quarter, and accelerated in Q1. The result in domains demonstrates the opportunities that exist for GoDaddy even in its most mature business. We are a two-sided marketplace for Domains, independent customers on one side and domain investors on the other. The high-teens growth in Domains is driven by innovation on connecting these customers and we will continue to innovate to drive these high levels of growth. I wanted to share a couple of examples of this with you: We created new experiences for Domain Investors that allowed them to quickly do bulk searches and orders. That simplified the day-to-day experiences for them. As domain investors engaged more, they added domains into the aftermarket, which we then pulled into new search experiences for independents, so they could have access to more inventory and find the right name for their venture. We also did the reverse; we gave independent customers an easy way to list their domain name in the aftermarket, a way that was seamless and custom-built for them. Independent customers added over 200,000 domain names that had otherwise been passive, into the aftermarket, spurring activity for Domain Investors. Creating these types of loops can quickly accelerate, and our team is reviewing every experience from basic parking to deep learning models, and testing improvements that add value to the customer and spur network effects. One such opportunity that we will bring to bear is with our GoDaddy Registry business. A few weeks ago, we announced some small acquisitions, with big aspirations. We're adding about 30 new TLDs to GoDaddy Registry, including .club, .design, and the MMX portfolio. The efficiencies of scale make obvious sense and the reason for us to scale GoDaddy Registry is to be able to innovate for our customers. Following the acquisitions that we've announced, GoDaddy will be the third-largest registry in the world, and our platform allows us to add TLDs at near-zero incremental cost. The high-margin business gives us investment dollars, while keeping costs low. This is key to us creating new experiences for customers, while giving them a choice of the best TLDs, both from our partners and from GoDaddy. In closing, as we have shared in the past, our formula for success, first and foremost, is about creating value for our customers. Our operating velocity is about innovation driving a constant increase in customer value allowing us to shift part of the value to shareholders. GoDaddy had a strong quarter, powered by a good acceleration in bookings. And yes, our strong business model showed up, and yes, we flexed our organic and inorganic muscles for growth, and yes, we invested in our products and marketing while delivering healthy unlevered free cash flow, but the key to long-term growth and value creation remains that we are a customer-led software company focused on innovation for our customers, and our customers continue to want to do more with us. With that, let's hear from Ray now, in what will be his last quarterly call for GoDaddy. Thank you, Ray. Hey, Sterling, this is Aman. Maybe I'll start and Ray can jump in. You know, the story here and of course, there's, you know, growth from the primary market, we're seeing sort of new demand customers coming in, but the outsized growth in the aftermarket as well, and there's good demand there. But the real story here is about innovation, right? We want to increase the pace of innovation at the company, we've put that energy into the domain side, and you're seeing the results of that, you know, as we continue to improve the product, we've seen more inventory, basically more domains going to the aftermarket. And on both sides, independence and domain investors, sort of taking advantage of that. You know, our view is that we'll continue to innovate, to look for opportunities, sort of on every [road], to improve the customer experience. And, you know, the innovation will continue to drive growth for the company. You know, in terms of sustainability, you know, we like to think that we're making changes that make the growth durable, but of course, you know, as we've said, before, that we started to see some goodness in Q4 of last year. So, we're going to have to continue to innovate to sort of continue to drive growth. So, I'll turn it to Ray to add a bit more color. Yeah, let me take the last bit of that first, this is Aman, Jan. In terms of the freemium rollout, we continue to be super happy with the rollout. Majority of customers in the U.S. are now seeing the freemium product. We are still gathering the last bits of data on it, but we are satisfied from a conversion standpoint that it is doing better than free trial, and it's going to be the way forward for us. Our path there, the next steps there will be about taking freemium into other English speaking markets, and then our other international markets. So that's, sort of the roadmap for freemium moving forward. And in terms of the comparison, year-over-years, I'll turn it to Ray. And then, in terms of the feature set, Nick, you know, it's all about very, very quickly bringing features to market that create value for customers, that increases their engagement, that increases their customer success, right. That drives awareness \u2013 that success for them drives sort of the awareness of the product, not just with them, but with other people. And you know, the beautiful word of mouth that continues there.  But internally, what it does is that customer success leads to us being able to build an ecosystem of upsell, be able to build an ecosystem where they're able to adopt new and new capability, and we're able to offer them more. And then we're able to bring that success to, sort of earlier in the sales path where we can use that messaging in terms of confidence to say, you know, ex-percent of customers are using this, you should try to, you can get it with this starter package of websites plus marketing. Hopefully, that answers a little bit of, I think, the question that you were asking. And there's just a ton of opportunity for us to drive awareness about our product, you know, I look at a lot of research where customers are just surprised to see how simple and intuitive and kind of powerful websites plus marketing is for their needs, but they just didn't know that it existed or that it did [X, Y, Z] and us continuing to launch those features, you know, just makes it very, very big.  And then quick mention on the Pro side, you know, this is why we did the expand program. You know, we have a new editor in play for WordPress, we've launched the hub. And we've got to get word out there that GoDaddy is bringing to the table new feature set functionality, you know, a huge amount of it for free, that can really make life easier for the Pros. And you know, so far they're liking what they're seeing. Yeah, it's super early days. And, you know, I've mentioned a couple of metrics for some of the features, you know, where we have a little bit more data, and no doubt for things like boosted posts, and others. We'll see, I think, really, really good engagement from our customers on those. In terms of engagement with the hub, the 300,000 number comes from looking at our basic customers, as you know we have 1.5 million Pros on our platform, which is just a massive number. But to engage them at a much deeper level, you know our \u2013 what we did is we segmented those customers.  And we said, look, here are the types of sub segments within those that could really benefit from a tool like the hub, and those are the customers we're targeting, you're going to see us, sort of reach out to them with sort of innovative marketing solutions, that bring them to the hub that allow them to try tools and then sort of add value to it every week, literally every week, every other week we put something out there.  So that, you know, if you go to the hub today, for example, you know, one of the things we have out there is more data for them for their websites that we're capturing, and you'll see some data set, and then you'll see right in front of it coming soon, you know, on the next thing. So that they, they feel that the velocity of change that they feel that, okay, I'm seeing this today, and I'm going to have something in a week or two, and I need to come back together. So that that's the type of loop we're trying to create to bring 300,000 folks into the hub. Yeah, happy to take that. On the payments piece, you know, we have a WordPress solution out there. That's a small start, because we're trying to see, you know how things work and push through things through the pipe. But the big launch, as you said, you know, is about websites plus marketing and having a completely seamless experience. The way I'd want you to visualize that is, you know, customer comes to us, they start with a website or a domain, ultimately they have an online, store online. And as they're picking their payments provider, they have a clean default choice that says, you know, started with GoDaddy payments. And it just works seamlessly every interface they go into looks the same, feels the same, works the same way, is connected in the background.  So, they are not copy pasting anything, you know, everything related to their, sort of selling capability, whether it's in, you know, it's on their side or with partners like Amazon, or Etsy or others is handled seamlessly and just taken care of. And of course, the omni-commerce solution, which we're committed to launching this year, is about bringing the capability of in-store into that same ecosystem as well. You know, outside of that, we're also targeting managed WordPress, which is our instance of WordPress and GoDaddy payment solution for managed WordPress, which we will also be launching in a few weeks. You know, as we put those pieces together, the point about awareness, of course, continues to become bigger and bigger. But once we have a full solution, we can actually go to market in a different way.  We can actually go to market and talk to customers about having the full capability of them being able to do it in the manner that they like to do it with GoDaddy, where the solutions are simple, the technology is intuitive, and the human guidance is always, always available to them. So that's what you should expect from us. In terms of reopening, we are still evaluating reopening, you know like many other companies, we have done some surveys of the employee base, we have put in some dates where, you know, we're going to incur what \u2013 ask folks to come in on a volunteer basis.  And so far, there's not a lot of folks taking us up on that. I think folks continue to be concerned. I think, folks, in many places \u2013 and it depends on country, as you well know, obviously the situation in India, very, very difficult right now, but depending on country, you know, there are some locations where people are slightly more open to it. But at this point, we think it's looking more like later in the summer that we'll have a set of folks back in the office. Yeah, you know, we're happy with the productivity that we've continued to add more sort of tech, we've continued to add more capability for the guides to work remotely because we realize that this is, sort of a new normal for quite a bit. So far, we're pretty happy with the productivity. We start to lap some of that, you know, going into April and May here. So, so far, we're pretty happy with it. Thank you. Ygal, thanks for the question. You know, on the cohorts, as Ray said, Q1 came in as a strong cohort, and definitely behaving similar to the Q2, Q3 cohorts, so, we \u2013 that he talked about. I think, overall, that's great customer numbers. They're coming in through similar channels. You know, as an example, you talked about Pros, you know the stuff we're talking about Pros is still early. So, what you are going to expect is the channels are pretty similar. And it's similar to what we saw through the pandemic last year. So, there isn't a lot of, sort of change in terms of the shape. It's just nice increase, continued nice increase in customer numbers, and just more going through the pipe. And then on the second piece, I'll let Ray take it. Yes, for sure, Matt. So the approach here is very much aligned with our broader approach as a company. The idea is to build tools and capabilities that add value to the customer drive engagement, drive value, right, over time, take some of that value and shift it to shareholders, right. Absolutely the Pro hub is a fantastic tool that not only helps Pros come in and manage WordPress instances, you know, both hosted at GoDaddy and outside. But it also gives them a place where they can do a bit of project management or manage their clients. And we're adding more and more capabilities to it. The idea is to create value for the Pro. As an example, we already know that just the pros that are using it right now are saying that they can save about three hours per site rate per month, already with just what we have today. So, as we save those Pros time, we expect to have a bigger part of their business with GoDaddy. And it forms a great starting point for us to be able to put in front of them, you know, new capabilities, new products, because they have a high engagement product that they come to all the time that they \u2013 it creates value for them, and gives us the opportunity to now expose them to products that we monetize. I think we're very early in that space. We know that Pros are super interested in commerce, we know that WooCommerce supports a huge percentage of the online e-commerce sort of GMV today. So, we know there's great demand there. We know there's a strong community behind it. But we're still pretty early in that process. As you'll remember, in Q4, last year, we did an acquisition called SkyVerge, so we now have a team that is dedicated to WooCommerce. They're part of the overall commerce division, which as you know, is led by Osama Bedier, who joined us from Poynt. So, we're actually bringing all the different pieces together at the company and saying here's the commerce division they are going to deliver a platform that works across websites plus marketing and manage WordPress. Thank you. Yeah, sorry, I can take that. Overall, you know, the growth we talked about was all commerce across, you know, websites plus marketing suite. So, that grew 70%, year-over-year and it's \u2013 if I remember right, well consistent with what we've talked about. We've consistently seen that skew grow, you know, faster than the other skews. And I think it matches the demand we have in the market today, right. Customers are coming online, they're looking for an online store, you also saw us shift, I think I talked about it in the previous call some of our merchandising, where you come to the homepage of GoDaddy, and unless we already know you and personalize it, what we put right in front of you is the ability to build an online store with websites plus marketing. In terms of the percentages, you know, going into the commerce skew versus others, broadly in line with what we've talked to you about, you know, it continues to be the product that customers are excited about. It continues to be the product that we're putting a lot in. And it's not just about product commerce, as I've talked in my prepared remarks. We're doing more and more first services commerce customers, as well. And their needs are unique and different. What they're looking for is tools that help them do the online appointment and sort of, you know things that go along with that. So, you know, overall, I would say the similar trend, but hopefully that little bit of color helps. Yeah. We continue to be very happy with the Poynt integration, we're moving very aggressively the products that we're building and testing right now. And as I said, you know, we've got something out there for WordPress already. And you'll see more from us in websites plus marketing within a few weeks. You know, from my perspective, they'll look fantastic. It's exactly, sort of seamless, intuitive experience that our customer base needs and we're absolutely excited about providing that.  We're still on track to provide an omni-commerce solution. This year, our teams are working in parallel and burning the [midnight] on that, you know, we're all super excited about it. We think it's going to make a difference in the market. And bringing, sort of in-store, online, and platforms, Amazon, Etsy, all of those sales together in one place bundled with commerce, with payments, and honestly more opportunities coming right behind the invoicing and others.  We think it's just fantastic. But overall in terms of talking about numbers a bit too early. And as Ray said, we have a number out there for 2023, and, you know, we think it's conservative because we really think the opportunity is very large. Thank you. Yeah, one of the things we realize is, you know, to innovate, we needed a bit more scale in that business. We need more TLDs. We need to be able to give the customer more choice. So, what you see here is us adding a bit of scale and of course there's some financial advantages to that too, but adding a bit of scale so that we can really drive a more innovative experience for our customers. Believe me we're doing some small things there and as soon as we have something that we're super excited about, you guys will hear about it. Yeah, I think, you know, as we talked about a little bit, the Q1 cohort was a strong cohort. And, you know, we'll continue to spend in marketing till we see the returns. And as Ray guided, you know, right now, we intend to continue to spend in marketing as best as we can see today. We see good returns for that marketing spend, or at least well within our guidelines. So that's what we're expecting to do. Obviously, there's no crystal ball and I can't talk about what's going to happen. But overall, we still feel pretty good about it. Thank you. Thank you, Christie. I wanted to take just a moment to thank Nima Kelly and Ray Winborne. Nima has been the backbone of this company for almost 20 years and her contribution is immeasurable. You know, I know this group doesn't get to see her, but Nima is always in the background with us on these calls and always helping out and has done so much for the company. And Ray, you know, just, you guys get to see him all the time, total joy to work with, such a professional. And Ray, I'm really glad you get to go out on a [beaten race], and Sterling joke, which Sterling you gave me a big laugh. You know that this is a good point to hand off to Mark for sure. So, thank you, Nima and Ray and thank you all GoDaddy employees for a great quarter and thanks to you all for joining the call."

I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating and business metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, gross merchandise volume or GMV, gross payments volume or GPV, and net debt. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to investors.godaddy.net or in today\u2019s earnings release included in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. The matters we\u2019ll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation, new product introductions and innovations, and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today February 14, 2023 and except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements, because of new information or future events. With that, here\u2019s Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy\u2019s mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. We achieve this by providing sage guidance and robust tools so our customers can have a one-stop shop with GoDaddy. GoDaddy is delivering tools that help our customers get online and start their digital journey, tools that merge the in-store and online experience for their customers and bring commerce to every surface. This empowers them to focus on running their business. Today, Mark and I will cover our 2022 financial results and key accomplishments in the context of our 3-year plan laid out at Investor Day last February. We will also share more information on our progress, especially in Commerce and the continued opportunity there and managing our P&L in the face of an uncertain macro environment. In 2022, GoDaddy delivered $4.1 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a constant currency basis and over $1 billion in Normalized EBITDA driving a 25% margin. Free cash flow increased 13% leading to a 22% increase in free cash flow per share of $6.20 higher than our 2022 targets. Our strategy, direction and priorities continue to be consistent with our 3-year plan as we work to empower new customers and our large base of existing customers with more of our product offerings, including enabling Commerce on every surface. I will go into a bit more detail in the Commerce priority section but just to touch on it now, in about 18 months, GoDaddy has added incredible new products to our lineup, including OmniCommerce offerings with Websites + Marketing and our newly launched SaaS solution, Managed WooCommerce Stores on WordPress, Payable Domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons and much more. Our previously announced commerce offerings are now fully in market. And today, we are adding to that lineup with an exciting new partnership with FIS Worldpay, to be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. The teams are already working together, and we are receiving positive feedback from customers. We remain confident in the long-term growth potential we outlined last year in our 3-year plan, but also recognize that these top-line growth targets may be challenged in the short-term. As a result, we have taken some aggressive and disciplined actions in our cost structure that will result in over $100 million in annualized cost savings, preserving our ability to achieve profitability targets even in a weak economic environment. These actions include deeper integration of some of our acquired brands, an overall reduction in vendor spend and an 8% reduction in our global workforce. We will continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments in our top growth areas and priorities of driving commerce through presence, delivering for Web Pros and innovating in domains. As always, I will share a bit about our key priorities on this call and focus more on Commerce this time. On driving commerce through presence, at Investor Day we shared our vision of connected commerce, which is about bringing commerce to every surface. Our goal has been to launch products and capabilities to engage the commerce customer early in the lifecycle, which might be a Payable Domain or a Pay Button on a Websites + Marketing freemium website. We have made tremendous progress in this direction through the broad release of payments into our website builders, domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons, and more. In Q4, we furthered our reach by enabling GoDaddy Payments, by default, in all new commerce websites. In January, we rolled out our payments by default out to new domain purchases. Most of our new offerings have been in market in the U.S. for less than a year and we are just starting to engage our base, so I am happy to share that our customers transacted $760 million of gross payment volume in 2022. GPV has been accelerating, and we are looking forward to sharing this metric with you regularly. We have also launched our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering on WooCommerce and WordPress, called Managed WooCommerce Stores. This product is targeted at the larger end of our micro-business customers, giving them the flexibility and ability to scale to their needs. Merchants can sell on a highly performant website, sell in-person using GoDaddy terminals, and via marketplace and social channels with shared payments and inventory. We are excited by the opportunity and potential this offering brings to customers who need a more robust solution. We are also leveraging our Managed WooCommerce Stores offering in our new partnership with FIS Worldpay. FIS Worldpay is a market-leading merchant services provider, and we will be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. FIS Worldpay provides payment strategies and technologies to over 1,400 financial institutions, including more than 700 credit unions throughout the U.S., supporting over 33 million debit cards and processing more than 15.7 billion transactions each year. Bringing together FIS Worldpay\u2019s reach, and our commerce products will create a significant new offering in the marketplace. And briefly on supporting GoDaddy Pros, we have continued to improve our product offering and have started to integrate more deeply some of our acquired brands. While these projects are complex, they will lead to a much better customer experience and lower costs. For one of our key brands, Media Temple, we informed all customers in December 2022 and will be sunsetting the brand over the next 3 months. And while I already mentioned our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering, we are actively testing price points that best appeal to our Web Pros customers and audience. Our third priority is innovating in domains and we continue to add value into our aftermarket platform. In Q4, our Dan.com integration reached a critical milestone 6 months ahead of schedule by launching Dan listings on our Afternic platform. All Dan users currently opted-in for the distribution network will now benefit from greater exposure as their inventory is automatically integrated into the Afternic domain listing service network. This milestone was accompanied by numerous other enhancements such as bid and offer history that further optimized the aftermarket experience. Payable Domains is 100% enabled in the U.S. and will be ramping up the marketing launch in a couple of weeks. As you recall, Payable Domains are branded pay links that create a secure checkout page, shareable via a link, that enable U.S.-based domain name customers to begin accepting payments shortly after they purchase a newly registered domain, even if they do not yet have a website or online store. For any domain purchased, existing or new, customers can already access the respective Payable Domain through their GoDaddy Dashboard. Combining the ability to accept payments with the credibility of a domain name enables small businesses to get up and running easily and quickly. While this capability has been rolling over a few months, we\u2019re thrilled and ready to be fully in-market giving GoDaddy domain customers a truly differentiated domain with expanded payment capabilities. In closing, we are pleased with the quarterly and annual financial results we delivered, while operating in this difficult environment. More importantly, we are proud of our progress against the key initiatives that we outlined last year at our Investor Day. We remain incredibly excited for the future. We are building on our unique market leading position with identified, abundant, long-term opportunity, bringing together our customers\u2019 digital identity, their presence and connecting commerce to every surface. Being this one-stop shop for our customers is at the center of our strategy. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, participating in our customers\u2019 success, intently focused on delivering strong financial results, and as always growing shareholder value. With that, here\u2019s Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks Aman. Hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Last year, we hosted a comprehensive Investor Day, where we shared our financial goals for the coming 3 years around revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, free cash flow per share and share buybacks. GoDaddy turned in a strong year against those financial goals, delivering revenue of $4.1 billion; Normalized EBITDA of $1 billion; free cash flow per share of $6.20 and executing $1.3 billion in share buybacks, meeting and exceeding our targets. While revenue growth has moderated in the short-term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day and feel the strategic steps Aman described earlier will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of growth going forward. We also remain committed to completing our share buybacks authorized by the Board last year. Reviewing our annual financial results, total revenue was $4.1 billion in 2022, growing 7%. Excluding a point and a half of FX headwind, total revenue for the year would have grown over 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue for the year grew to $1.3 billion, representing 13% growth, and Core platform revenue for the year totaled $2.8 billion, representing 5% growth, both in line with the targets we set last year. International revenue was $1.3 billion for the year, representing 5% growth. Excluding the FX impact, international growth would have been 8% on a constant currency basis. Total bookings in 2022 was $4.4 billion, growing 4%, or 6% on a constant currency basis. Full year unlevered free cash flow grew to $1.1 billion, representing 14% growth, in line with our guide issued last year. Free cash flow grew 13% to $969 million. Free cash flow per share increased 22% to $6.20 per share, ahead of our investor day target of $6. Lastly, full year Normalized EBITDA grew 16% topping $1 billion, resulting in a 25% margin for the year, which is an expansion of 2 points over the prior year. Moving on to our fourth quarter results, total revenue topped $1 billion, growing 2%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue grew 3%, or 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue grew 11% to $333 million, in line with the guided range of 10% to 12% for the quarter. Growth in Applications and Commerce was fueled by continued adoption of our Create and Grow products, email attach, and increasingly the adoption of GoDaddy payments and the related hardware sales. The ARR for applications and commerce grew 9% to $1.3 billion. With that, the ARR from our create and grow products grew 8% to $445 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $28 billion. Furthering our efforts to provide more visibility into key growth areas of the business, we will share a new metric demonstrating our progress with GoDaddy Payments. GPV represents the dollar amount of payments processed on the GoDaddy payments platform. With Q4 as the first quarter with commerce fully launched on every surface in the U.S., GPV has already grown to an impressive $760 million. Core platform revenue decreased 2% to $707 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the tough compare to the year-ago quarter when aftermarket benefited from some larger than average transactions we have discussed previously as well as a modest decrease in our hosting business. As previously mentioned, the hosting business has out-sized exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for core platform grew 1% to $2.3 billion. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, flat year-over-year and growing 2% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 7% on strength of Websites + Marketing, email attach and hardware and software sales. Core Platform bookings decreased 3% year-over-year on tough aftermarket compares noted earlier and due to softness in the broader hosting business. Gross margin was down slightly for the quarter, primarily due to product mix. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as this revenue stream gets larger in the future. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments, so we expect payments to be highly accretive to Normalized EBITDA as we scale. Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 5% to $266 million, representing a 26% margin and an expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. GoDaddy\u2019s high brand awareness and the effectiveness of our in-house bidding algorithm allowed us to drive efficiencies in marketing spend. We also continued to drive leverage in customer care. Unlevered free cash flow grew 17% to $238 million, while free cash flow grew 16% to $202 million delivering $1.29 free cash flow per share in the quarter, a 25% increase over last year\u2019s Q4 free cash flow per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the year with $774 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt landed at $3.1 billion, below 3 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. On our share repurchase efforts, we\u2019ve returned $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders under the current authorization. From January 1, 2022 through February 1, 2023, we repurchased 17.2 million shares, which has reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 10% since the beginning of 2022, on target for the 15% to 20% net reduction for the 3-year period. On customers, over recent years, the way we generate revenue has evolved through our expanded offerings to our customers, resellers and partners. We will continue to use metrics like ARR, GMV and GPV to show the health of our business and the progress towards our strategic goals as discussed at Investor Day. As a result of the way our relationship with customers is evolving, we have updated the way we measure and report our total customers. In addition to paid subscriptions at the end of the period, we will now include accounts with paid transactions in the trailing 12 months and exclude accounts that have converted to free versions of our software. These changes do not meaningfully affect the historical customer growth or retention trends previously disclosed. We believe the updated definition more accurately reflects the dynamic customer lifecycle and provides more detail around the overall strength of our historical cohorts with a continued focus on long-term customers with a higher propensity to spend. Under the new definition, in 2022 ARPU increased to $197 compared to $187 and $170 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Retention rates remained consistent at 85% and customer count increased to 20.9 million in 2022 compared to 20.7 and 20.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Moving on to our outlook for Q1 and for full year 2023, let us start by covering several notable events. In January, we signed a partnership agreement with FIS Worldpay to be a strategic reseller of our OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. This arrangement is expected to drive growth in the second half of the year and will contribute to our commerce strategy through increased reach of our OmniCommerce offerings and website attachment. We are excited about the launch of this partnership in 2023 and the momentum this gives our Application and Commerce segment going into 2024 and beyond. On restructuring, we took certain actions necessary to align our structure with the current economic environment and position ourselves for future growth. This will result in annualized savings of approximately $100 million through a combination of a reduction in workforce, reduced spending, and integration of certain European brands and businesses within our Core Platform segment. This will also result in a modest headwind to core platform revenue of 100 basis points in 2023 as we sunset certain brands. We expect estimated restructuring and other related exit charges of $55 million to $65 million with most of the charges to be recognized in the first half of 2023. In Q1 2023, we are targeting total revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion. This represents 4% growth at the midpoint of the range and includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind from prior year bookings. Excluding this, the midpoint of our guidance would imply approximately 6 points of growth. We expect Normalized EBITDA margin during Q1 to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.25 billion to $4.325 billion, representing growth of 5% at the midpoint of the range. This outlook is inclusive of approximately 2 points of headwind from FX from prior year bookings and the anticipated brand integrations mentioned above. In the Application and Commerce segment, we are projecting revenue growth of 8% to 10%. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Normalized EBITDA during the year is expected to continue to grow, with a targeted margin of approximately 26%. As a reminder, as we scale our commerce offerings, gross margin will be pressured and is expected to be in the low- to mid-60s range. As we gain operational efficiency in commerce, this is expected to drive incremental Normalized EBITDA margins. As we have shared previously, we have multiple levers within our control to drive margins, while we continue to invest in the business. This allows us to strike a balance and continue growing revenue, while achieving operating leverage down the income statement to drive sustainable shareholder value over the cycle. You have seen our recent record of accomplishment of delivering against our margin targets, and we are confident in executing on our profitability goals this year regardless of where we land within our revenue guidance range. For the full year of 2023, we are targeting free cash flow of greater than $1 billion and unlevered free cash flow of greater than $1.2 billion. We remain on target to deliver free cash flow per share of more than $7 and are committed to returning capital to the shareholders under the remaining buyback authorized by the Board in 2022. As stated in the past, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and we will continue to evaluate our use-of-cash options on a quarterly basis. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $50 million, income tax payments of approximately $30 million and cash interest payments of approximately $170 million. Moving forward, we will share ARR, GMV, ARPU and customer count quarterly. We will share GPV and retention rate annually. Taken together, these metrics provide a more comprehensive view of GoDaddy\u2019s expansive business over time and provide a view into revenue growth and profitability as we continue to expand customer lifetime value. These metrics may fluctuate based on acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and seasonality. That said, we are in an advantaged position given our ability to provide an ever-growing suite of solutions to a large, embedded customer base. In summary, we are proud of our strong and resilient business model, where we are mission critical to our customers. We are confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day, and feel the strategic steps taken this quarter will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of revenue growth going forward into 2024 and beyond. Our predictable model provides us the visibility to make prudent business decisions and allows us to remain resolute in operating the business to grow long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll hand over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&A.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. Sorry about the technical difficulties in the middle of the call, our prepared remarks are posted to investors.godaddy.net for reference. As a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please use the raise hand feature on the bottom center of the webinar screen to be added to the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead.\nAaron Kessler: Thank you, and congrats on the year. Maybe just first on the revenue growth, can you just provide a little bit more details how are you thinking about 2023 revenue growth maybe between customer growth and pricing? And does guidance include any maybe price increases, or just your general thoughts on ability to raise pricing in the future as well?\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aaron, and thanks for the question. When we look at 2023, we\u2019re looking at a few things that are within our growth rate. One, we\u2019re going to have some headwinds related to the FX in our bookings in 2022 rolling through the first part of the year, and therefore impacting our overall growth. Second to that, we have integrations we\u2019re taking into effect. And we\u2019ve put some headwinds related to those into our numbers. I think when you look at us overall and take into account those, you\u2019re looking at around a 6% annualized growth rate before that, when it comes to pricing always nuanced for us, we have a broad set of products across our customer base, and what we continue to look at opportunities to price within the market, where we can take more \u2013 we need to take the price, and we continue to look for opportunities to take market share where we can. And, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of things going on coming into 2023, we\u2019ve assumed that some of the macroeconomic environment that we\u2019ve seen in the second half of 2022 persists throughout the year. And, we think we\u2019ll have some acceleration related to some things that we\u2019ve talked about before around commerce. And, of course, we\u2019re excited about the new Worldpay partnership that we signed recently.\nAman Bhutani: That\u2019s right. And maybe I\u2019ll just add that all of those factors are included in the guide, as Mark would normally say. And we take those actions, especially pricing into account, when we do the guide.\nAaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just expand on those macro comments a little bit. So if we look at your commentary, it seems like retention rates have held steady. So on the macro side, is it just more in terms of you\u2019re seeing lower demand, and why might that be? And then when we look at those customer addition numbers you gave, how should we think about the net additions for 2022 in terms of rolling that forward? And what should be a reasonable net customer attrition expectation?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, Matt, I can start with that, and maybe Mark can cover a couple of the items just to step through all those items. Overall, when we look at 2022 retention rates continued to be strong. We talked about 85% plus retention rates for our customers, and we\u2019re very happy with those. What we have talked about through the year was that our customers did see some headwinds. So we did see a little bit of pressure on that number. We also talked a little bit about the gross adds being slightly weaker on the \u2013 I think, in the last call. It\u2019s a combination of those factors that really impact the net adds for 2022. Looking into 2023, I don\u2019t know, Mark, if you want to touch on just, we don\u2019t guide to net adds, particularly, but we\u2019re generally assuming the same demand patterns going from 2022 to 2023. And we\u2019re continuing to expect the same strong retention rates for the company, because we\u2019re showing up every day delivering the great products and the great service. So we continue to expect those to continue.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. We continue to focus on customers with a greater propensity to spend with us and that will be our focus. And as we noted in our stated remarks, our definition of a customer is changing and we\u2019re dealing more with resellers. We signed a partnership with Worldpay that we announced. In certain cases now, through those agreements, we\u2019ll have access to their customers, but they will be our customers. So the ongoing definition and nature of net adds will change and become more broad for us going forward. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on ARPU, continue to focus on being a one-stop shop, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on making sure that we can provide all the benefits to our customers going forward that will drive our growth.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great, thanks. On the decline in Core Platform arrive in the quarter; can you just talk about what areas were maybe stronger or weaker versus your own expectations? Was it greater declines than hosting and security? Or was that aftermarket flowing and converging with core domains? Or is it just the overall softer customer growth, appreciate the comments on the gross add cadence and that sort of thing. And then any color on how fast aftermarket is actually growing, or how large it is as a percent of revenue, just any update there would be appreciated?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Perfect. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the drivers within our Core Platform. And consistent with what we talked about coming out of Q3, we are continuing to see pressure on the aftermarket. Overall, it\u2019s still contributing about 6% growth to our revenue today coming out of the year, it is about 10% of our overall revenue. So we\u2019re still seeing progress. They\u2019re just not at the pace that we saw in 2021. And also we talked about in Q3 hosting; we\u2019re seeing impacts around the European market for hosting, especially when you take it outside of the GoDaddy core platform hosting platform. And we continue to see uneven demand and pressure on retention rates in that business. Overall, those are the things that I think have been consistent when we saw Q3 looking at Q4, and we see that going into Q1 of 2023. And, I think, I\u2019m going to have to pause there, because I forgot the second half of the question.\nTrevor Young: Yeah. You\u2019ve really addressed it with the aftermarket piece, just how large it is. But just to dovetail on what you were answered there, Mark, the brand that\u2019s being sunset. Is that specifically a hosting product, so we should expect that trend to kind of continue perhaps worsen?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, the brand we\u2019re talking about is Media Temple, and it is a big hosting brand for GoDaddy.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello, thank you for taking the question. Firstly, on the Worldpay partnership encouraging to hear that that arrangement is expected to drive growth in the second half of this year. I was wondering if we get a little bit more of the specifics of the partnership. What does that refill arrangement look like? Will the economics be different for those partnerships, customers, and then any sense on the ARPU opportunity for those customers that would seem like those Worldpay customers might skew a lot higher in terms of size of customer compared to your existing pay?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, of course, it\u2019s too early to talk about ARPU opportunity, or sort of the specifics of how the relationship would develop. But we\u2019re super excited about the partnership given the reach of Worldpay. And you\u2019re absolutely right, the small and medium sized business, that\u2019s the customer Worldpay is sort of on the bigger end of our micro business customers. But we\u2019re ready with the product and putting our products next to Worldpay reach is going to create an exciting new opportunity in the market. We\u2019re looking, it\u2019s a long-term partnership between the two companies, our teams are excited to work together, we\u2019re starting to see some customers in the pilot, and we\u2019re pretty excited about where this can go.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And also the launch for 2023 is in the U.S. only. So there\u2019s a lot more opportunity down the road, and we\u2019re very, very excited about it. We have to hit some milestones that the first half of the year leading into the second half. But when you look at our overall commerce platform, and how revenue comes out of our commerce platform. We have hardware and software sales. We have reseller. We have GoDaddy payments, and then we have the attach-related to Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. And Worldpay partnership will hit several of those, we\u2019ll start with hardware and software. It\u2019ll have some reseller impact and it\u2019ll also allow us to attach directly to their customers Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. So we think the ability to drive not only ARPU as we go into 2024, but our growth rates around commerce are going to be fantastic, given the nature of this relationship.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. And if I could just ask one follow-up, Create and Grow ARR slight improvement in year-over-year trends and if I look at it from what you disclosed maybe an improvement in sequential trends. At this point, I\u2019m wondering if I could get your view on where we are in the curve of the macro. Does it feel like we\u2019ve leveled out in terms of the customer trends in e-commerce? Any kind of comment there would be helpful?\nAman Bhutani: Well, it\u2019s \u2013 do you want to\u2026\nMark McCaffrey: No. Go ahead.\nAman Bhutani: Maybe I\u2019ll go first, and you can jump in as well. I think, none of us have the crystal ball, it\u2019s really hard to sort of predict the macro, but then we continue to see sort of uncertainty around it. And, we\u2019re doing our best to look at the data that we have and look at the indicators in the marketplace. And I\u2019m sure everybody else looks at it as well. But we\u2019re trying to run the business and what we see and we\u2019re pretty happy with our results, and we\u2019re focused on the execution and what we control.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah, I gave up trying to be an economist in this environment, that\u2019s the truth. We have a broad business, too. So we see impacts in different areas. And example, we\u2019ve talked about aftermarket, we\u2019ve seen the impact in this environment around our transactions there. But commerce continues to make progress going into 2023, we\u2019re seeing a lot of taking \u2013 talk about the attach-related to Websites + Marketing, when people are coming through the funnel, we\u2019ve continued to see the progress of our existing customer base or 21 million customers converting over to payments. We\u2019re really excited for the first time that we have all the revenue streams in place, and they\u2019re making progress towards our stated objectives, especially as we look at 2024 and beyond. So, the one thing that we continue to evaluate as our business gets impacted in different ways based on different things happening, which gives us protection overall, but something we need to continue to monitor.\nClarke Jeffries: Really appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question is from Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So it sounds like you\u2019re still committed to the 15% EBITDA, and then the free cash flow guidance gave, and it sounds like we\u2019re stepping off of the commitment to the revenue growth given the macro business. So first, just thinking about \u2013 or can you help us think about the right way to think through revenue growth and where we should be thinking what you guys are thinking. And then on the OpEx in the $100 million savings, any more color you could share on where typically those are coming from which line items?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah, I\u2019ll start, and Aman you could add. So looking at our investment thesis going back to Investor Day, we talked about the revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, cash flow per share, share buybacks, were our main components. And in looking at the profitability and the cash flow per share coming into 2022, we started the year in forecasting 23% to 24% for the year. We\u2019re exiting the year 26%, so we\u2019re ahead of target on profitability. We\u2019re delivering cash flow per share greater than the $6, we had targeted at $61.20. So those two, we are really happy with our progress. Things like FX and the macro environment hit our bookings. In that booking, especially in our subscription revenue, takes time to roll out. So we\u2019re seeing headwinds leading into 2023 related to that revenue growth. We also with some of the actions we\u2019re taking or building in some headwind on revenue for the integrated brands that we\u2019ve been talking about. So as time goes on, we think we are well positioned to be a double-digit revenue growth company going forward. But it will take time for our bookings to roll to our revenue to get back to the tailwinds versus the headwinds we\u2019re facing coming into 2023. We feel really good about our ability to meet our other objectives around profitability around cash flow per share. And we stay committed to our share buybacks, so a lot of positive there. But we are controlling what we can control and we\u2019re monitoring what what\u2019s going on in the macro environment. Assuming that, we will see a headwind turn into a tailwind as we go into 2024.\nAman Bhutani: I think you covered it all. I think what I might add is that our success GoDaddy is aligned with sort of secular trends around people coming to the internet, people transacting on the internet, people wanting to get their idea out there and be inspired and be an entrepreneur. And that opportunity is huge. And we\u2019re super excited about it and pursuing it over the medium to long term. From my perspective, if the top-line metrics, if those milestones are moving a bit, it doesn\u2019t change our direction, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy, it actually allows us to focus the business and put ourselves in a position where we can grow faster and as the macro improve being a very good position to take share.\nYgal Arounian: Great. And then, on the OpEx kind of where that\u2019s coming from specifically for savings?\nMark McCaffrey: So a couple of different areas. One, most of the actions were primarily around our Core Platform segment to give some color of the area. And then, some of the areas in line items include, HR recruiting, marketing, I think, we\u2019re the ones that were targeted during this event. And I think those were the primary things within our operating expense.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. And then last question on the Worldpay partnership there, it\u2019s really interesting. I think it\u2019s the first major retail partnership you guys have done? Is this a shift in strategy to do more things like this, and that become a bigger part of the customer growth and kind of future growth?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, look, our path is to see GoDaddy terminals in every store, and to see GoDaddy software being used by millions and millions of micro and small businesses, a partnership like Worldpay gives us access to be able to reach a pool of customers faster. So I would say it\u2019s very much aligned to our core strategy. And, yes, as opportunities present themselves to reach our goals or execute that strategy. We\u2019ll look at other opportunities as well.\nYgal Arounian: Okay, great. Thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter at Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much. I just wanted to hit on the restructuring a little bit more. So could you help us understand just the restructuring announcement with the context for your outlook on revenue growth to start to improve from Q4 and Q1 guidance? Is this more about allocation of resources versus an outlook on demand? And then just related, how should we think about reinvestment in the business?\nMark McCaffrey: So I\u2019ll start with \u2013 hi, Elizabeth. I\u2019ll start with the Q4 leading into Q1, when we look at our growth and the impact, 2022 had on our bookings coming out of Q4. We needed to right size our operating structure to reflect the bookings growth and the impact that was going to have on revenue growth going into 2023. And that\u2019s how we looked at it controlling what we can control from an operating perspective. And monitoring and assuming that the macroeconomic environment we\u2019re in today will persist throughout the year. When it comes to investment in tech and dev, we primarily looked at core platform, and some of the non-strategic brands around hosting as we started to evaluate where we were going to look at productions versus invest. And the flip side of it is applications and commerce continues to be an area we invest in, commerce continues to be a growth driver for us leaving it to 2024. So when it comes to investment in tech and dev, we continue to push towards that. I always use the commentary, there\u2019s two things you need to have to win in the tech industry going forward, you need innovation, and you need to own the customer relationship, we can continue to focus on both of those continue to innovate. Commerce, again, is one of the areas we continue to look for innovation and growth. And obviously, our customer care relationships have been something that has been strength for us going forward. So those two areas continue to be the areas of investment for us.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. And then just on the ARPU, given the change in customer count any context for how ARPU grew in 2021 versus the 10% that you just recorded for 2022. And, how should we think about the level of sustainability any opportunity there is to actually accelerate ARPU into 2023, just as you improve through the attach of commerce and payments?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, we\u2019re absolutely focused on growing ARPU. And, our strategy around bundling more products and something we\u2019ve talked about over many quarters, right, is about bringing new customers and existing customers and exposing them to more and more of our product range. So we\u2019re absolutely looking at opportunities to increase ARPU. And just to touch on your comment over the years, the trends are similar. We\u2019ve had sort of consistent ARPU growth over the years and we\u2019re investing and making the right decisions to continue to see that happen.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah, continued focus on customers with a greater entity to spend in commerce, we think it will be a big opportunity. 85% of our revenue comes from our existing subscription base right now, but as we get more into the transactional nature of the businesses on the one-stop shop, that will create an opportunity for us to continue to increase ARPU.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. The increased disclosure is a good thing. So, thanks for doing that and doing it quarterly going forward. You talked about marketing launch for payables domain in the U.S., you provide any more color on that? And then any color on the timing for international Payable Domains enablement? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, thanks, Mark. The marketing launch starts in about 2 weeks with some PR, and you\u2019ll start to see Payable Domains really show up in a lot of our marketing collateral, including the site today, you can get to Payable Domains in fact, I think I\u2019ve talked about it in the past that just given our large size of domains under management, we had to roll this out. So we could support all different kinds of domains. We\u2019re ready with that in the U.S. Now we\u2019re just going to bring it to the site, bring it into our marketing bring it into our merchandising and promotions, so that every customer new and existing is able to see it, and in this start to connect the dots for them so that they start to understand what a Payable Domain is. In terms of international, obviously, we feel this product is very global, just like a domain name Payable Domain with appealing, because just should work everywhere in the world, but no specific timing on international rollout just yet.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Mark.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of [John Bryan] [ph] from Jefferies on behalf of Brent Thill. John, please go ahead. Hey, John, you\u2019re muted.\nAman Bhutani: John?\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry about that, I guess, now unmuted. Thanks. This is John [ph] on behalf of Brent Thill. The first question on the FIS Worldpay, is there when you think about when that is scaled, what sort of impact they might have on gross margin and operating margin?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. So as we think it\u2019s going to start to have impact in 2023, as we hit certain milestones, now it\u2019ll be relatively small within 2023, but it\u2019ll give us momentum going into 2024. We expect it to be accretive to our margins overall, our operating margins. Again, as we start to scale, and the breadth of the relationship is just not about a transactional, but it\u2019s hardware/software leads to other fees, and then leads to our ability to attach Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress, that should give us the ability to get operating leverage and improve our operating margins down the road. We\u2019re very excited about this. It\u2019s a very broad relationship. Again, it\u2019s focused on the U.S. right now. But we think the opportunity to go global on it overall is going to be exciting moving forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. And then, we\u2019re about halfway through Q1. I\u2019m wondering, what you see in terms of the environment, in terms of the activity and demand trends? And does it feel like it\u2019s similar to Q4? Are you starting to see any recovery at all with new customer base? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah, I think, the word that we\u2019ve used in the past continues to work, which is \u2013 we continue to see sort of uncertainty around what\u2019s going to happen. There is no large fluctuation. But even when we look at the geographies, when we look at certain products that we sell, we do see trends that are different from what we\u2019ve seen in the long-term. And, right now, in any one geography, a trend can change very, very quickly. But, overall, I\u2019d say over the last couple of quarters were \u2013 looking into Q1, we\u2019re seeing some core stability, which is ultimately a good thing.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 we still think that the large opportunity is out there for us to go gather, obviously, we\u2019re assuming the macro environment stays muted a bit as we go into 2023. And, again, coming back to one of my previous answers, different parts of our business are impacted differently in this environment, and we continue to see that and monitor that. We\u2019ve talked about aftermarket, we\u2019ve continued to see \u2013 not seeing the large transactions related to aftermarket. So that is something that has continued into 2023. On the other hand, we see greater attach around commerce, and we\u2019re seeing the trend continue to grow throughout the year. So we\u2019re excited about things going in to the rest of the year. However, we\u2019re acknowledging that some of these may take some time to develop as we reset our bookings into revenue or under subscription business. Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes to the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak, please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. And I just want to ask about the pricing expectations for 2023. There\u2019s a lot of pricing tweaks happening in the market currently given the sustained inflation. Can you talk about philosophy \u2013 your philosophy in 2023 whether you see potential to raise prices on any products either on the domain side or on other areas? And then, second question, are you seeing any market share shifts in your core products in domains, or in Websites + Marketing currently?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. On pricing, Deepak, we continue to have a nuanced approach. As I\u2019ve talked about before, we price our products based on the customer population we serve based on the geography, there is also specific bundling and channel dynamics, your pricing as well. We also maintain that we provide services and products to our customers, where the value we provide is much higher than the price that we have. So we do continue to feel that there\u2019s pricing opportunity. But we\u2019ll continue to be nuanced about it, because we have added a lot of capabilities over the last year for us to be flexible around how we price and how we market and how we sort of move dollars around within between geos and channels to allow us to get the best return on ad spend. So, yes, you\u2019ll see some pricing actions from us, which are all in the guide like Mark says, but you\u2019ll also see some sort of \u2013 as you see some increases, you\u2019ll also see in some markets, some decreases, because our testing clearly shows that there\u2019s room to take share there. And that\u2019s sort of our approach to market share overall as well. We\u2019re constantly now testing these things. And when we see an opportunity, we\u2019re going to lean in and take market share, and we\u2019re able to move marketing dollars around quickly much faster, I would say, than we were in the past. So we will lean in there and take market share. And in other markets where we see opportunity to take price, we will take price.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. And then, if I can just ask one quick follow-up, and I apologize if this was asked already. Can you unpack the 2023 revenue guidance a little bit, maybe specifically in terms of how much you expect contribution from things like payments, and some of these other incremental growth areas?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. We haven\u2019t gotten into the breakdown of each of the contributing areas we\u2019re looking at in our revenue guidance right now is continued growth in ARR around our subscription businesses. Again, a focus on applications and commerce is obviously our higher growing area right now versus our core platform, which we\u2019ve talked about some of the pressures we\u2019ve seen around hosting and aftermarket. We continue to be excited about commerce, we haven\u2019t broken down the dollars between all of that, but we look at that as a contributor. And remember, we we\u2019re looking at some of the \u2013 in our subscription business, what I would say, a rollover effect of the FX that will be a headwind for our revenue in the first part of the year. But assuming macro condition stabilizes should become a tailwind as we get to the back half of the year, as well as looking out into 2024. So a lot of moving parts there, we haven\u2019t gotten into this product versus this product type of things. We\u2019re extremely excited about the progress of commerce that\u2019s the one thing we continue to call out. We\u2019re excited about the contribution of Worldpay, and the momentum it gives us going into 2024, again, those around our applications in commerce business. And we continue to see our ability to be that one-stop shop for our customers and be able to long-term opportunity that we continue to pursue.\nChristie Masoner: Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Aman for some final remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us. As always I\u2019d like to thank all GoDaddy employees for another good quarter, and sort of the focused energy to continue to drive the business and grow the business. We\u2019ll see you next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy's mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. We achieve this by providing sage guidance and robust tools so our customers can have a one-stop shop with GoDaddy. GoDaddy is delivering tools that help our customers get online and start their digital journey, tools that merge the in-store and online experience for their customers and bring commerce to every surface. This empowers them to focus on running their business. Today, Mark and I will cover our 2022 financial results and key accomplishments in the context of our 3-year plan laid out at Investor Day last February. We will also share more information on our progress, especially in Commerce and the continued opportunity there and managing our P&L in the face of an uncertain macro environment. In 2022, GoDaddy delivered $4.1 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a constant currency basis and over $1 billion in Normalized EBITDA driving a 25% margin. Free cash flow increased 13% leading to a 22% increase in free cash flow per share of $6.20 higher than our 2022 targets. Our strategy, direction and priorities continue to be consistent with our 3-year plan as we work to empower new customers and our large base of existing customers with more of our product offerings, including enabling Commerce on every surface. I will go into a bit more detail in the Commerce priority section but just to touch on it now, in about 18 months, GoDaddy has added incredible new products to our lineup, including OmniCommerce offerings with Websites + Marketing and our newly launched SaaS solution, Managed WooCommerce Stores on WordPress, Payable Domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons and much more. Our previously announced commerce offerings are now fully in market. And today, we are adding to that lineup with an exciting new partnership with FIS Worldpay, to be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. The teams are already working together, and we are receiving positive feedback from customers. We remain confident in the long-term growth potential we outlined last year in our 3-year plan, but also recognize that these top-line growth targets may be challenged in the short-term. As a result, we have taken some aggressive and disciplined actions in our cost structure that will result in over $100 million in annualized cost savings, preserving our ability to achieve profitability targets even in a weak economic environment. These actions include deeper integration of some of our acquired brands, an overall reduction in vendor spend and an 8% reduction in our global workforce. We will continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments in our top growth areas and priorities of driving commerce through presence, delivering for Web Pros and innovating in domains. As always, I will share a bit about our key priorities on this call and focus more on Commerce this time. On driving commerce through presence, at Investor Day we shared our vision of connected commerce, which is about bringing commerce to every surface. Our goal has been to launch products and capabilities to engage the commerce customer early in the lifecycle, which might be a Payable Domain or a Pay Button on a Websites + Marketing freemium website. We have made tremendous progress in this direction through the broad release of payments into our website builders, domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons, and more. In Q4, we furthered our reach by enabling GoDaddy Payments, by default, in all new commerce websites. In January, we rolled out our payments by default out to new domain purchases. Most of our new offerings have been in market in the U.S. for less than a year and we are just starting to engage our base, so I am happy to share that our customers transacted $760 million of gross payment volume in 2022. GPV has been accelerating, and we are looking forward to sharing this metric with you regularly. We have also launched our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering on WooCommerce and WordPress, called Managed WooCommerce Stores. This product is targeted at the larger end of our micro-business customers, giving them the flexibility and ability to scale to their needs. Merchants can sell on a highly performant website, sell in-person using GoDaddy terminals, and via marketplace and social channels with shared payments and inventory. We are excited by the opportunity and potential this offering brings to customers who need a more robust solution. We are also leveraging our Managed WooCommerce Stores offering in our new partnership with FIS Worldpay. FIS Worldpay is a market-leading merchant services provider, and we will be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. FIS Worldpay provides payment strategies and technologies to over 1,400 financial institutions, including more than 700 credit unions throughout the U.S., supporting over 33 million debit cards and processing more than 15.7 billion transactions each year. Bringing together FIS Worldpay's reach, and our commerce products will create a significant new offering in the marketplace. And briefly on supporting GoDaddy Pros, we have continued to improve our product offering and have started to integrate more deeply some of our acquired brands. While these projects are complex, they will lead to a much better customer experience and lower costs. For one of our key brands, Media Temple, we informed all customers in December 2022 and will be sunsetting the brand over the next 3 months. And while I already mentioned our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering, we are actively testing price points that best appeal to our Web Pros customers and audience. Our third priority is innovating in domains and we continue to add value into our aftermarket platform. In Q4, our Dan.com integration reached a critical milestone 6 months ahead of schedule by launching Dan listings on our Afternic platform. All Dan users currently opted-in for the distribution network will now benefit from greater exposure as their inventory is automatically integrated into the Afternic domain listing service network. This milestone was accompanied by numerous other enhancements such as bid and offer history that further optimized the aftermarket experience. Payable Domains is 100% enabled in the U.S. and will be ramping up the marketing launch in a couple of weeks. As you recall, Payable Domains are branded pay links that create a secure checkout page, shareable via a link, that enable U.S.-based domain name customers to begin accepting payments shortly after they purchase a newly registered domain, even if they do not yet have a website or online store. For any domain purchased, existing or new, customers can already access the respective Payable Domain through their GoDaddy Dashboard. Combining the ability to accept payments with the credibility of a domain name enables small businesses to get up and running easily and quickly. While this capability has been rolling over a few months, we're thrilled and ready to be fully in-market giving GoDaddy domain customers a truly differentiated domain with expanded payment capabilities. In closing, we are pleased with the quarterly and annual financial results we delivered, while operating in this difficult environment. More importantly, we are proud of our progress against the key initiatives that we outlined last year at our Investor Day. We remain incredibly excited for the future. We are building on our unique market leading position with identified, abundant, long-term opportunity, bringing together our customers' digital identity, their presence and connecting commerce to every surface. Being this one-stop shop for our customers is at the center of our strategy. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, participating in our customers' success, intently focused on delivering strong financial results, and as always growing shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. That's right. And maybe I'll just add that all of those factors are included in the guide, as Mark would normally say. And we take those actions, especially pricing into account, when we do the guide. Thank you. Yeah, Matt, I can start with that, and maybe Mark can cover a couple of the items just to step through all those items. Overall, when we look at 2022 retention rates continued to be strong. We talked about 85% plus retention rates for our customers, and we're very happy with those. What we have talked about through the year was that our customers did see some headwinds. So we did see a little bit of pressure on that number. We also talked a little bit about the gross adds being slightly weaker on the \u2013 I think, in the last call. It's a combination of those factors that really impact the net adds for 2022. Looking into 2023, I don't know, Mark, if you want to touch on just, we don't guide to net adds, particularly, but we're generally assuming the same demand patterns going from 2022 to 2023. And we're continuing to expect the same strong retention rates for the company, because we're showing up every day delivering the great products and the great service. So we continue to expect those to continue. Yeah, the brand we're talking about is Media Temple, and it is a big hosting brand for GoDaddy. Yeah, of course, it's too early to talk about ARPU opportunity, or sort of the specifics of how the relationship would develop. But we're super excited about the partnership given the reach of Worldpay. And you're absolutely right, the small and medium sized business, that's the customer Worldpay is sort of on the bigger end of our micro business customers. But we're ready with the product and putting our products next to Worldpay reach is going to create an exciting new opportunity in the market. We're looking, it's a long-term partnership between the two companies, our teams are excited to work together, we're starting to see some customers in the pilot, and we're pretty excited about where this can go. Well, it's \u2013 do you want to... Maybe I'll go first, and you can jump in as well. I think, none of us have the crystal ball, it's really hard to sort of predict the macro, but then we continue to see sort of uncertainty around it. And, we're doing our best to look at the data that we have and look at the indicators in the marketplace. And I'm sure everybody else looks at it as well. But we're trying to run the business and what we see and we're pretty happy with our results, and we're focused on the execution and what we control. I think you covered it all. I think what I might add is that our success GoDaddy is aligned with sort of secular trends around people coming to the internet, people transacting on the internet, people wanting to get their idea out there and be inspired and be an entrepreneur. And that opportunity is huge. And we're super excited about it and pursuing it over the medium to long term. From my perspective, if the top-line metrics, if those milestones are moving a bit, it doesn't change our direction, it doesn't change our strategy, it actually allows us to focus the business and put ourselves in a position where we can grow faster and as the macro improve being a very good position to take share. Yeah, look, our path is to see GoDaddy terminals in every store, and to see GoDaddy software being used by millions and millions of micro and small businesses, a partnership like Worldpay gives us access to be able to reach a pool of customers faster. So I would say it's very much aligned to our core strategy. And, yes, as opportunities present themselves to reach our goals or execute that strategy. We'll look at other opportunities as well. Yeah, we're absolutely focused on growing ARPU. And, our strategy around bundling more products and something we've talked about over many quarters, right, is about bringing new customers and existing customers and exposing them to more and more of our product range. So we're absolutely looking at opportunities to increase ARPU. And just to touch on your comment over the years, the trends are similar. We've had sort of consistent ARPU growth over the years and we're investing and making the right decisions to continue to see that happen. Yeah, thanks, Mark. The marketing launch starts in about 2 weeks with some PR, and you'll start to see Payable Domains really show up in a lot of our marketing collateral, including the site today, you can get to Payable Domains in fact, I think I've talked about it in the past that just given our large size of domains under management, we had to roll this out. So we could support all different kinds of domains. We're ready with that in the U.S. Now we're just going to bring it to the site, bring it into our marketing bring it into our merchandising and promotions, so that every customer new and existing is able to see it, and in this start to connect the dots for them so that they start to understand what a Payable Domain is. In terms of international, obviously, we feel this product is very global, just like a domain name Payable Domain with appealing, because just should work everywhere in the world, but no specific timing on international rollout just yet. Thank you, Mark. John? Yeah, I think, the word that we've used in the past continues to work, which is \u2013 we continue to see sort of uncertainty around what's going to happen. There is no large fluctuation. But even when we look at the geographies, when we look at certain products that we sell, we do see trends that are different from what we've seen in the long-term. And, right now, in any one geography, a trend can change very, very quickly. But, overall, I'd say over the last couple of quarters were \u2013 looking into Q1, we're seeing some core stability, which is ultimately a good thing. Yeah. On pricing, Deepak, we continue to have a nuanced approach. As I've talked about before, we price our products based on the customer population we serve based on the geography, there is also specific bundling and channel dynamics, your pricing as well. We also maintain that we provide services and products to our customers, where the value we provide is much higher than the price that we have. So we do continue to feel that there's pricing opportunity. But we'll continue to be nuanced about it, because we have added a lot of capabilities over the last year for us to be flexible around how we price and how we market and how we sort of move dollars around within between geos and channels to allow us to get the best return on ad spend. So, yes, you'll see some pricing actions from us, which are all in the guide like Mark says, but you'll also see some sort of \u2013 as you see some increases, you'll also see in some markets, some decreases, because our testing clearly shows that there's room to take share there. And that's sort of our approach to market share overall as well. We're constantly now testing these things. And when we see an opportunity, we're going to lean in and take market share, and we're able to move marketing dollars around quickly much faster, I would say, than we were in the past. So we will lean in there and take market share. And in other markets where we see opportunity to take price, we will take price. Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us. As always I'd like to thank all GoDaddy employees for another good quarter, and sort of the focused energy to continue to drive the business and grow the business. We'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks Aman. Hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Last year, we hosted a comprehensive Investor Day, where we shared our financial goals for the coming 3 years around revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, free cash flow per share and share buybacks. GoDaddy turned in a strong year against those financial goals, delivering revenue of $4.1 billion; Normalized EBITDA of $1 billion; free cash flow per share of $6.20 and executing $1.3 billion in share buybacks, meeting and exceeding our targets. While revenue growth has moderated in the short-term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day and feel the strategic steps Aman described earlier will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of growth going forward. We also remain committed to completing our share buybacks authorized by the Board last year. Reviewing our annual financial results, total revenue was $4.1 billion in 2022, growing 7%. Excluding a point and a half of FX headwind, total revenue for the year would have grown over 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue for the year grew to $1.3 billion, representing 13% growth, and Core platform revenue for the year totaled $2.8 billion, representing 5% growth, both in line with the targets we set last year. International revenue was $1.3 billion for the year, representing 5% growth. Excluding the FX impact, international growth would have been 8% on a constant currency basis. Total bookings in 2022 was $4.4 billion, growing 4%, or 6% on a constant currency basis. Full year unlevered free cash flow grew to $1.1 billion, representing 14% growth, in line with our guide issued last year. Free cash flow grew 13% to $969 million. Free cash flow per share increased 22% to $6.20 per share, ahead of our investor day target of $6. Lastly, full year Normalized EBITDA grew 16% topping $1 billion, resulting in a 25% margin for the year, which is an expansion of 2 points over the prior year. Moving on to our fourth quarter results, total revenue topped $1 billion, growing 2%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue grew 3%, or 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue grew 11% to $333 million, in line with the guided range of 10% to 12% for the quarter. Growth in Applications and Commerce was fueled by continued adoption of our Create and Grow products, email attach, and increasingly the adoption of GoDaddy payments and the related hardware sales. The ARR for applications and commerce grew 9% to $1.3 billion. With that, the ARR from our create and grow products grew 8% to $445 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $28 billion. Furthering our efforts to provide more visibility into key growth areas of the business, we will share a new metric demonstrating our progress with GoDaddy Payments. GPV represents the dollar amount of payments processed on the GoDaddy payments platform. With Q4 as the first quarter with commerce fully launched on every surface in the U.S., GPV has already grown to an impressive $760 million. Core platform revenue decreased 2% to $707 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the tough compare to the year-ago quarter when aftermarket benefited from some larger than average transactions we have discussed previously as well as a modest decrease in our hosting business. As previously mentioned, the hosting business has out-sized exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for core platform grew 1% to $2.3 billion. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, flat year-over-year and growing 2% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 7% on strength of Websites + Marketing, email attach and hardware and software sales. Core Platform bookings decreased 3% year-over-year on tough aftermarket compares noted earlier and due to softness in the broader hosting business. Gross margin was down slightly for the quarter, primarily due to product mix. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as this revenue stream gets larger in the future. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments, so we expect payments to be highly accretive to Normalized EBITDA as we scale. Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 5% to $266 million, representing a 26% margin and an expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. GoDaddy's high brand awareness and the effectiveness of our in-house bidding algorithm allowed us to drive efficiencies in marketing spend. We also continued to drive leverage in customer care. Unlevered free cash flow grew 17% to $238 million, while free cash flow grew 16% to $202 million delivering $1.29 free cash flow per share in the quarter, a 25% increase over last year's Q4 free cash flow per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the year with $774 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt landed at $3.1 billion, below 3 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. On our share repurchase efforts, we've returned $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders under the current authorization. From January 1, 2022 through February 1, 2023, we repurchased 17.2 million shares, which has reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 10% since the beginning of 2022, on target for the 15% to 20% net reduction for the 3-year period. On customers, over recent years, the way we generate revenue has evolved through our expanded offerings to our customers, resellers and partners. We will continue to use metrics like ARR, GMV and GPV to show the health of our business and the progress towards our strategic goals as discussed at Investor Day. As a result of the way our relationship with customers is evolving, we have updated the way we measure and report our total customers. In addition to paid subscriptions at the end of the period, we will now include accounts with paid transactions in the trailing 12 months and exclude accounts that have converted to free versions of our software. These changes do not meaningfully affect the historical customer growth or retention trends previously disclosed. We believe the updated definition more accurately reflects the dynamic customer lifecycle and provides more detail around the overall strength of our historical cohorts with a continued focus on long-term customers with a higher propensity to spend. Under the new definition, in 2022 ARPU increased to $197 compared to $187 and $170 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Retention rates remained consistent at 85% and customer count increased to 20.9 million in 2022 compared to 20.7 and 20.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Moving on to our outlook for Q1 and for full year 2023, let us start by covering several notable events. In January, we signed a partnership agreement with FIS Worldpay to be a strategic reseller of our OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. This arrangement is expected to drive growth in the second half of the year and will contribute to our commerce strategy through increased reach of our OmniCommerce offerings and website attachment. We are excited about the launch of this partnership in 2023 and the momentum this gives our Application and Commerce segment going into 2024 and beyond. On restructuring, we took certain actions necessary to align our structure with the current economic environment and position ourselves for future growth. This will result in annualized savings of approximately $100 million through a combination of a reduction in workforce, reduced spending, and integration of certain European brands and businesses within our Core Platform segment. This will also result in a modest headwind to core platform revenue of 100 basis points in 2023 as we sunset certain brands. We expect estimated restructuring and other related exit charges of $55 million to $65 million with most of the charges to be recognized in the first half of 2023. In Q1 2023, we are targeting total revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion. This represents 4% growth at the midpoint of the range and includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind from prior year bookings. Excluding this, the midpoint of our guidance would imply approximately 6 points of growth. We expect Normalized EBITDA margin during Q1 to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.25 billion to $4.325 billion, representing growth of 5% at the midpoint of the range. This outlook is inclusive of approximately 2 points of headwind from FX from prior year bookings and the anticipated brand integrations mentioned above. In the Application and Commerce segment, we are projecting revenue growth of 8% to 10%. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Normalized EBITDA during the year is expected to continue to grow, with a targeted margin of approximately 26%. As a reminder, as we scale our commerce offerings, gross margin will be pressured and is expected to be in the low- to mid-60s range. As we gain operational efficiency in commerce, this is expected to drive incremental Normalized EBITDA margins. As we have shared previously, we have multiple levers within our control to drive margins, while we continue to invest in the business. This allows us to strike a balance and continue growing revenue, while achieving operating leverage down the income statement to drive sustainable shareholder value over the cycle. You have seen our recent record of accomplishment of delivering against our margin targets, and we are confident in executing on our profitability goals this year regardless of where we land within our revenue guidance range. For the full year of 2023, we are targeting free cash flow of greater than $1 billion and unlevered free cash flow of greater than $1.2 billion. We remain on target to deliver free cash flow per share of more than $7 and are committed to returning capital to the shareholders under the remaining buyback authorized by the Board in 2022. As stated in the past, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and we will continue to evaluate our use-of-cash options on a quarterly basis. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $50 million, income tax payments of approximately $30 million and cash interest payments of approximately $170 million. Moving forward, we will share ARR, GMV, ARPU and customer count quarterly. We will share GPV and retention rate annually. Taken together, these metrics provide a more comprehensive view of GoDaddy's expansive business over time and provide a view into revenue growth and profitability as we continue to expand customer lifetime value. These metrics may fluctuate based on acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and seasonality. That said, we are in an advantaged position given our ability to provide an ever-growing suite of solutions to a large, embedded customer base. In summary, we are proud of our strong and resilient business model, where we are mission critical to our customers. We are confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day, and feel the strategic steps taken this quarter will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of revenue growth going forward into 2024 and beyond. Our predictable model provides us the visibility to make prudent business decisions and allows us to remain resolute in operating the business to grow long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll hand over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&A. Thanks, Aaron, and thanks for the question. When we look at 2023, we're looking at a few things that are within our growth rate. One, we're going to have some headwinds related to the FX in our bookings in 2022 rolling through the first part of the year, and therefore impacting our overall growth. Second to that, we have integrations we're taking into effect. And we've put some headwinds related to those into our numbers. I think when you look at us overall and take into account those, you're looking at around a 6% annualized growth rate before that, when it comes to pricing always nuanced for us, we have a broad set of products across our customer base, and what we continue to look at opportunities to price within the market, where we can take more \u2013 we need to take the price, and we continue to look for opportunities to take market share where we can. And, obviously, there's a lot of things going on coming into 2023, we've assumed that some of the macroeconomic environment that we've seen in the second half of 2022 persists throughout the year. And, we think we'll have some acceleration related to some things that we've talked about before around commerce. And, of course, we're excited about the new Worldpay partnership that we signed recently. Yeah. We continue to focus on customers with a greater propensity to spend with us and that will be our focus. And as we noted in our stated remarks, our definition of a customer is changing and we're dealing more with resellers. We signed a partnership with Worldpay that we announced. In certain cases now, through those agreements, we'll have access to their customers, but they will be our customers. So the ongoing definition and nature of net adds will change and become more broad for us going forward. We're going to continue to focus on ARPU, continue to focus on being a one-stop shop, and we're going to continue to focus on making sure that we can provide all the benefits to our customers going forward that will drive our growth. Yeah. Perfect. Maybe I'll start with the drivers within our Core Platform. And consistent with what we talked about coming out of Q3, we are continuing to see pressure on the aftermarket. Overall, it's still contributing about 6% growth to our revenue today coming out of the year, it is about 10% of our overall revenue. So we're still seeing progress. They're just not at the pace that we saw in 2021. And also we talked about in Q3 hosting; we're seeing impacts around the European market for hosting, especially when you take it outside of the GoDaddy core platform hosting platform. And we continue to see uneven demand and pressure on retention rates in that business. Overall, those are the things that I think have been consistent when we saw Q3 looking at Q4, and we see that going into Q1 of 2023. And, I think, I'm going to have to pause there, because I forgot the second half of the question. Yeah. And also the launch for 2023 is in the U.S. only. So there's a lot more opportunity down the road, and we're very, very excited about it. We have to hit some milestones that the first half of the year leading into the second half. But when you look at our overall commerce platform, and how revenue comes out of our commerce platform. We have hardware and software sales. We have reseller. We have GoDaddy payments, and then we have the attach-related to Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. And Worldpay partnership will hit several of those, we'll start with hardware and software. It'll have some reseller impact and it'll also allow us to attach directly to their customers Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. So we think the ability to drive not only ARPU as we go into 2024, but our growth rates around commerce are going to be fantastic, given the nature of this relationship. No. Go ahead. Yeah, I gave up trying to be an economist in this environment, that's the truth. We have a broad business, too. So we see impacts in different areas. And example, we've talked about aftermarket, we've seen the impact in this environment around our transactions there. But commerce continues to make progress going into 2023, we're seeing a lot of taking \u2013 talk about the attach-related to Websites + Marketing, when people are coming through the funnel, we've continued to see the progress of our existing customer base or 21 million customers converting over to payments. We're really excited for the first time that we have all the revenue streams in place, and they're making progress towards our stated objectives, especially as we look at 2024 and beyond. So, the one thing that we continue to evaluate as our business gets impacted in different ways based on different things happening, which gives us protection overall, but something we need to continue to monitor. Yeah, I'll start, and Aman you could add. So looking at our investment thesis going back to Investor Day, we talked about the revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, cash flow per share, share buybacks, were our main components. And in looking at the profitability and the cash flow per share coming into 2022, we started the year in forecasting 23% to 24% for the year. We're exiting the year 26%, so we're ahead of target on profitability. We're delivering cash flow per share greater than the $6, we had targeted at $61.20. So those two, we are really happy with our progress. Things like FX and the macro environment hit our bookings. In that booking, especially in our subscription revenue, takes time to roll out. So we're seeing headwinds leading into 2023 related to that revenue growth. We also with some of the actions we're taking or building in some headwind on revenue for the integrated brands that we've been talking about. So as time goes on, we think we are well positioned to be a double-digit revenue growth company going forward. But it will take time for our bookings to roll to our revenue to get back to the tailwinds versus the headwinds we're facing coming into 2023. We feel really good about our ability to meet our other objectives around profitability around cash flow per share. And we stay committed to our share buybacks, so a lot of positive there. But we are controlling what we can control and we're monitoring what what's going on in the macro environment. Assuming that, we will see a headwind turn into a tailwind as we go into 2024. So a couple of different areas. One, most of the actions were primarily around our Core Platform segment to give some color of the area. And then, some of the areas in line items include, HR recruiting, marketing, I think, we're the ones that were targeted during this event. And I think those were the primary things within our operating expense. So I'll start with \u2013 hi, Elizabeth. I'll start with the Q4 leading into Q1, when we look at our growth and the impact, 2022 had on our bookings coming out of Q4. We needed to right size our operating structure to reflect the bookings growth and the impact that was going to have on revenue growth going into 2023. And that's how we looked at it controlling what we can control from an operating perspective. And monitoring and assuming that the macroeconomic environment we're in today will persist throughout the year. When it comes to investment in tech and dev, we primarily looked at core platform, and some of the non-strategic brands around hosting as we started to evaluate where we were going to look at productions versus invest. And the flip side of it is applications and commerce continues to be an area we invest in, commerce continues to be a growth driver for us leaving it to 2024. So when it comes to investment in tech and dev, we continue to push towards that. I always use the commentary, there's two things you need to have to win in the tech industry going forward, you need innovation, and you need to own the customer relationship, we can continue to focus on both of those continue to innovate. Commerce, again, is one of the areas we continue to look for innovation and growth. And obviously, our customer care relationships have been something that has been strength for us going forward. So those two areas continue to be the areas of investment for us. Yeah, continued focus on customers with a greater entity to spend in commerce, we think it will be a big opportunity. 85% of our revenue comes from our existing subscription base right now, but as we get more into the transactional nature of the businesses on the one-stop shop, that will create an opportunity for us to continue to increase ARPU. Yes. So as we think it's going to start to have impact in 2023, as we hit certain milestones, now it'll be relatively small within 2023, but it'll give us momentum going into 2024. We expect it to be accretive to our margins overall, our operating margins. Again, as we start to scale, and the breadth of the relationship is just not about a transactional, but it's hardware/software leads to other fees, and then leads to our ability to attach Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress, that should give us the ability to get operating leverage and improve our operating margins down the road. We're very excited about this. It's a very broad relationship. Again, it's focused on the U.S. right now. But we think the opportunity to go global on it overall is going to be exciting moving forward. Yeah, it's \u2013 we still think that the large opportunity is out there for us to go gather, obviously, we're assuming the macro environment stays muted a bit as we go into 2023. And, again, coming back to one of my previous answers, different parts of our business are impacted differently in this environment, and we continue to see that and monitor that. We've talked about aftermarket, we've continued to see \u2013 not seeing the large transactions related to aftermarket. So that is something that has continued into 2023. On the other hand, we see greater attach around commerce, and we're seeing the trend continue to grow throughout the year. So we're excited about things going in to the rest of the year. However, we're acknowledging that some of these may take some time to develop as we reset our bookings into revenue or under subscription business. Thank you. Yeah. We haven't gotten into the breakdown of each of the contributing areas we're looking at in our revenue guidance right now is continued growth in ARR around our subscription businesses. Again, a focus on applications and commerce is obviously our higher growing area right now versus our core platform, which we've talked about some of the pressures we've seen around hosting and aftermarket. We continue to be excited about commerce, we haven't broken down the dollars between all of that, but we look at that as a contributor. And remember, we we're looking at some of the \u2013 in our subscription business, what I would say, a rollover effect of the FX that will be a headwind for our revenue in the first part of the year. But assuming macro condition stabilizes should become a tailwind as we get to the back half of the year, as well as looking out into 2024. So a lot of moving parts there, we haven't gotten into this product versus this product type of things. We're extremely excited about the progress of commerce that's the one thing we continue to call out. We're excited about the contribution of Worldpay, and the momentum it gives us going into 2024, again, those around our applications in commerce business. And we continue to see our ability to be that one-stop shop for our customers and be able to long-term opportunity that we continue to pursue."

        "content": "Operator:\nChristie Masoner: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Mark's voice may sound a bit scratchy today as he is currently under the weather. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, gross merchandise volume or GMV and net debt. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation, new product introductions and innovations, and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today November rd3, 2022 and except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all, championing micro and small business customers. One of our customers, Tyron Harper, co-owner of Harp Vision, was recently asked, what happens if Harp Vision doesn\u2019t succeed? His response was I never thought about it. I only thought about it succeeding. Every day we are inspired by our customers. I know we make a difference in their lives and in uncertain times our mission becomes even more important. None of us have a crystal ball to perfectly predict the future, but I can tell you that our customers are creative and resilient. In a recent survey, while more of our customers expressed a negative near-term outlook they generally remained a positive group with two-thirds of them reporting optimism about their business. Today, we are pleased to announce our Q3 results with 7% revenue growth, 15% growth in normalized EBITDA, and continued strong customer retention of more than 85%. These achievements are noteworthy given the continued negative foreign currency impact, uneven demand patterns, and lower consumer confidence. Our core competitive advantages of high global brand awareness to attract customers, sage guidance through Care to help retain customers, and seamlessly intuitive experiences to deliver mission-critical products and services to our customers uniquely position GoDaddy to weather economic challenges from a position of strength. While we are not immune to economic turbulence, we are committed to action and attention on what we can control. As in previous quarters, we will be prudent with our cost structure. Day to day, that comes down to focusing on success-based marketing, monitoring headcount and directing investments on the most important growth initiatives, including simplification and automation. This formula helps us deliver a great service efficiently. Maintaining strong cohort retention, driving new customer adds, increasing ARPU and extending commerce and payments attach are all important to achieving our long-term goals. In Q3, we continued to drive strong retention that is in-line with our past cohort performance. This demonstrates that through the varying economic cycles over the past couple of years, we successfully attracted the customers that have the right intent, those customers that can grow and attach more with us over time thus benefiting GoDaddy\u2019s ARPU. On gross adds, the data over the last few months suggests that there was a pull-forward during peak COVID times, though the magnitude of this is hard to calculate until normal seasonality returns to the business. As a result, gross adds and domains under management are not expected to follow the same historical arc as in recent years. Countering this, we are encouraged by our ability to maintain strong retention, increase ARPU, and continue the growth and momentum we are driving in our commerce and payments business within our existing customer base. Our strategic priorities remain consistent; first, driving commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in domains. Beginning with presence, this quarter we added simplified site creation through improved guidance on template selection, making it easier for customers to start building an online presence. This update drove higher publish rates, which is an important indicator of customer success and increased lifetime value. You have heard me regularly talk about bringing Commerce to every surface at GoDaddy. Keeping with that, we have enabled payments in all Websites + Marketing plans, including our free plan. This shows up in the form of \u2018Buy Buttons\u2019 making it easier for nascent businesses, side-hustles, and the like to get started with our Commerce offering. Our goal here is to build the Commerce relationship with our customers as early as possible and then expand this relationship over time. These customers want a simple, inexpensive way to start taking payments. This functionality allows for that, while providing the lowest-in-industry online transaction rate of 2.3% +$0.30. Lastly, we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of our OmniCommerce solution, and I wanted to spend a moment to acknowledge all that we have accomplished in this area since the release. We have been very ambitious in building out these capabilities because our customers tell us that they prefer a single one-stop shop solution. We believe our connected commerce solution is poised to win at a greater rate because it is adding value for our customers while saving them time and money. We made notable updates in user experience, eCommerce value and a disruptive payments experience. We added in-store, point-of-sale and Online Store inventory sync with omni-channel reporting for merchants across all channels. Our customers can clearly see their sales across their physical store, their online store, third party marketplaces and social media platforms including Amazon, Etsy, Walmart.com and others. We've added Pay Buttons, integrated shipping labels, Apple Pay and a new Commerce Plus plan for Websites + Marketing, for up and running businesses that need sales tax automation. And our customers can use Mobile app QR Code Payments and Apple Pay for eCommerce. We have also expanded our payments and commerce experience into Woo Commerce for Managed WordPress, while also actively rolling out our Managed Woo Commerce Stores solution allowing us to serve larger customers. We started with larger customers doing up to a million dollars in sales, and we are finding that we can effectively serve high single digit million sellers as well, and we already have these customers in our base. It is still early days but we have made good progress in identifying, converting and activating these larger sellers. Attaching to our existing base is key to our long-term ambition with GoDaddy Commerce and GoDaddy Payments. We are learning a lot about the sales and implementation cycle to serve these customers and we will provide more updates over time. We know that customers who engage in commerce and payments are generally stickier and have over 80x higher lifetime value. We have continued to see positive momentum in new customers attaching GoDaddy Payments within in Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. These serve as consistent proof points that our customers want this capability from us, and it can fuel our growth and customer retention for years to come. Moving on to GoDaddy Pros, this quarter we launched free SSL on nearly all new web hosting plans in our major markets including the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India. Early data shows that this is driving increased term lengths and modest improvements in new units and bookings in our hosting business. While the macro and FX challenges on our hosting business are meaningful, we are focused on what we can control, making the product better for our customers. Along with free SSL, we have continued to improve server response time by rolling out infrastructure improvements across multiple hosting platforms. We have also continued to update GoDaddy's Pro Hub, putting a more competitive offering in the marketplace. Our hosting business in Europe is also exposed to rising energy costs and to mitigate that we secured a fixed power contract. Our third priority is innovation in Domains. The rollout of Payable Domains is going well with half of our domains now technically enabled as payable and ready for activation by customers. The first cohort of existing customers we exposed Payable Domains to were logged in domain plus email customers. These customers were identified as likely to have high intent and they have engaged with Payable Domains at an attractive rate. It is still too early to calculate how much usage Payable Domains will have for non-website customers, but we are encouraged by this beginning and moving as quickly as we can to merchandise it to more customers. We also released a new Auctions user experience that improves the buying experience with new bulk bidding and Buy-It-Now options, improved uptime, and a simpler and consistent design. We also launched a Domain Portfolio Manager for all customers giving them modern domain management capabilities aimed at increasing their efficiency and ease of use. While we are learning more about how the macro environment impacts the Aftermarket, we continue to focus on what we control, which is to improve the experience for domain investor customers and integrate Dan.com\u2019s capabilities into the broader GoDaddy secondary market. In closing, we look forward to finishing the year steadfast in our commitment of executing against our strategic priorities and working to achieve our long-term financial goals. As we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to be a leader in our space, with ample growth opportunities and the ability to participate in our customers\u2019 success. History has shown that companies that continue to innovate and invest appropriately during an economic downturn can exit the other side in an even better position. We will stay close to our customers, we will understand their greatest needs and we will delight them with guided Care, constantly innovating towards a seamless experience making our solutions stickier leading to greater customer lifetime value. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks Aman and thank you everyone for joining us today. In Q3, GoDaddy delivered solid results despite increasing currency and macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue was $1.03 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 4% on a reported basis, and 9% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 13%, within the guided range of 13 to 15% on the strength of our Create + Grow and our Commerce products as well as email attach. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 10% to more than $1.2 billion and within that, the ARR from our Create and Grow products grew 7% to nearly $430 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $29 billion. Core Platform revenue grew 5%, within the target range of 4% to 6%, primarily due to growth in the Aftermarket and increased pricing in domains, offset by a modest decrease in our hosting business. As Aman noted above, the hosting business has concentration and exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for Core Platform grew 2% to $2.3 billion. Q3 Bookings totaled $1.09 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 10% and Core Platform bookings grew 3% on similar growth factors noted for revenue. Normalized EBITDA grew 15% to $263 million, a margin rate of 25%, representing a 180 basis point expansion, year-over-year. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. Unlevered Free Cash Flow for the quarter totaled $297 million, growing 18% driven by strong profitability. Additionally, year-to-date we completed $1.15 billion of share buybacks, repurchasing 14.8 million shares, and reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 9% since year end. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.96 on a trailing twelve-month basis, versus prior year cash flow per share of $4.94, a 21% increase driven by strong cash flow and share repurchases. On the balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $826 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt stands at $3.1 billion, at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range of two to four times. Additionally, in October, we announced a new term loan facility of $1.8 billion, the proceeds of which are to be used to pay down our existing term loans due in 2024. The pending term loan facility contemplates a maturity date of 2029 and pricing based on SOFR + 325 basis points. We also announced our intent to increase the borrowing capacity under our existing $600 million revolving credit facility to a $1 billion facility maturing in 2027. These transactions, which are scheduled to close in Q4, are subject to customary closing conditions and would meaningfully increase our total liquidity. The cash interest payments under these transactions would increase our interest payments by roughly $35 million for 2023, resulting in expected annual interest of approximately $165 million. Moving on to our outlook, we are targeting Q4 total revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, representing growth of 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. As we previously discussed, the macro environment and FX has shifted since our initial guide in February. Additionally, we are facing a tough compare in our Aftermarket business. While our Aftermarket business showed strength in the fourth quarter last year, the demand for high value sales has been difficult to predict due to its short lead times and fast close rates. Our current guide does not factor in the same strength we experienced last year due to the current macro trends. Said simply, we do not expect Aftermarket demand in Q4 to enable the same revenue out performance we achieved in the year-ago quarter. Also, assuming a continuation of today\u2019s currency rates, we expect the adverse FX impact will be an incremental $5 million from our Q2 guide, for an incremental $40 million adverse impact from our initial February guide. Flowing through these factors into our segments, we expect some impact to our Applications and Commerce segment from uneven demand experienced in September and October. As a result, we expect this segment to grow between 10% and 12% for Q4 putting Applications and Commerce revenue growth at the low to mid-end of our range of 13% to 15% for the year. In Core Platform we expect revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year in Q4 on the impacts of Hosting and FX pressure mentioned previously as well as a tough compare in Aftermarket, which results in Core Platform revenue growth between 4 and 6% for the full year. Normalized EBITDA for Q4 is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million and remain within the targeted range of 24% to 25% for both the quarter and the year end, above our initial range of 23% to 24% provided in February. We expect our unlevered free cash flow for the year to be between $1.09 and $1.1 billion, putting our cash flow per share at $6 plus in line with the outlook shared in February. Our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We continued our buyback program during Q3 and will continue to evaluate use-of-cash options for the remainder of the year, in line with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Our attractive model and robust free cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest in our business at a time when others may have to pull back more aggressively, and to return cash to shareholders through our buyback program. At the same time, we remain disciplined on how and where we spend, with a focus on controlling our costs, optimizing our marketing spend, monitoring headcount and investing in tech so that we can strike the right balance between capturing attractive opportunities with delivering profits to our shareholders. Always with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. On our cost structure, last quarter we shared that we are focused on acting in areas we could control. Committed to that goal, we executed a couple of important contracts to reduce or mitigate exposure to increased costs. In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Amazon Web Services to continue to migrate workloads and development to the cloud. This contract will reduce our overall costs in the form of long-term capital spend and energy expenses while giving us the agility to launch new products at a faster pace. On energy costs, as Aman mentioned earlier, we secured a contract in Europe at a guaranteed rate for the next year, giving us mid-term stability on these costs impacting our European data centers. Lastly, as noted earlier, we are currently refinancing our 2024 debt to extend our due date to 2029 and limit our exposure to further interest rate increases. Through this anticipated new debt, we continue to expect our leverage ratio to remain between two to four times. We are committed to remaining transparent, and we will provide an update with our latest thoughts on key business trends when we share our 2023 guidance early next year. Like so many other companies, we are operating in a fluid environment and are not immune to its challenges. In closing, while the short-term revenue outlook is dynamic, we have continued confidence in our ability to execute. We believe our competitive position and strategic advantages, our diverse product offerings, our strong balance sheet and the consistent and predictable cash flow we generate places GoDaddy as a leader amongst its peers. While the range of outcomes is somewhat wider today than at points in the past, we are creating a track record as a responsible management team that can and will lead in good times and in tougher times, allowing our business to perform across economic cycles. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We will continue to focus on execution against our strategic priorities, tightly managing our business and building deeper customer relationships as we partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Mark. Taking a step back, we are incredibly proud of the work our teams are doing as we are making progress against our stated priorities. GoDaddy has a proven, focused strategy, executed by an experienced team that will act proactively and decisively through a fluid macro-economic environment to create long-term value for shareholders. Despite these headwinds and the tough compare in Q4, the full year is on track to deliver 7% growth or 9% on a constant currency basis. Coupled with the momentum we are driving in commerce, we are excited about what\u2019s to come in 2023 and beyond. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team to open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks Aman. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth please go ahead.\nElizabeth Porter: Hi, thank you so much. Obviously, macro is definitely softening. But I was hoping you could provide some color on just how the top of the funnel has changed from Q2 to Q3, and this far into Q4. And last quarter, you did speak about Europe as being a particular area of weakness? And has that trend extended more broadly to the US and any other geographies? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Elizabeth, this is Aman. I'm happy to take that question. When we talk about the unevenness of demand or the broader macro, if we take a step back, it's been kind of uneven for two plus years, Mark mentioned, sort of some of the September/October data as well. But I, when I look back, I see us navigating the last two years really well, our cohorts have continued to be consistent at about 85% retention or higher, and here we are without sort of, we came into 2022 with uncertainty. And it has been there has been quite a lot of uncertainty where we're sitting at 9%, constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins. We're taking all of that momentum with us into 2023. Are there regions of an unevenness by geography, like you said, or by month or by customer segment? Yes, that's absolutely there. And just to touch on Europe a bit, as we did last quarter, it's broadly similar, as we talked about last quarter, in the UK, in Germany are big markets for us there. So, clearly, we feel a bigger impact there. But we're watching the US very, very carefully. And we're watching our cohorts very, very quick, carefully. But we're taking all this momentum into 2023 and we're excited, we got a lot of new product on the table, a lot of new capabilities that in commerce and payments, WordPress improvements payable domains registry, like there's so much for us to look forward to that. I think we're just going to watch the numbers very carefully and make good decisions. And I'll turn it to Mark, I don't know, Mark, if you'd like to add something?\nMark McCaffrey: No, I think that's a good response. Aman, and just kind of bringing it home. I think it's more pronounced in Europe, no doubt, in UK, and Germany, like Amman mentioned, but then overall, looking at Q4 and the outperformance of aftermarket last year versus this year, we're not seeing the same demand around the larger deals, we see a lot of supply and demand. But these things are short to come and quick to close. And we've taken that out of our guide for Q4, because we just don't see it in front of us right now. So, I think that when you talk about demand overall, that's something you have to call out.\nElizabeth Porter: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you guys have always focused on attracting customers that could attach more product and have that higher LTV. And just in the current environment, what sort of changes are you seeing in the willingness to attach additional products or buy bundled solutions? One point -- one hand budgets might be tighter, but then the other hand there is an opportunity just to do more with a single platform versus any sort of smaller point solutions you might have looked at in the past. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, I'm happy to quickly touch on that. First, overall, our cohorts are performing consistently, ARPU is rising and continues to do well obviously we'll talk about it more at the end of the year. But our focus is to attract the customers with the right intent that want to use activate the products that we have. So that we continue to maintain that high customer retention rate. And as long as those cohorts form and customers are retained, we know that in any short to mid-term cycles may push customer demand up or down a bit. But over the long-term customers need the products we have. We deliver critical products to them at amazing prices and we know these products are core to their needs. So, short-term up and down is okay. But overall, I think ARPU -- the ARPU, numbers are showing that we're attracting the right customer.\nMark McCaffrey : And Aman, I'll add. I think the one-stop shop, the area is really coming to play. And I know we've talked about commerce and the attach we're seeing at the front of the funnel. But we're also seeing the competitive pricing in our existing customer base start to take hold. And I think Elizabeth going to your to your question, it really shows that in this market, dealing with a one-stop shop is a competitive advantage, and we're seeing customers really be attracted to that, not only new customers, but existing customers as well.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young : Great. Thanks. First, just more of a housekeeping one to start since investors have been asking. Just where did we finish the quarter in terms of domains under management relative to the $83.8 million reported last quarter. And then second one on aftermarket, Mark, maybe could you give us any sort of data points in terms of like percentage of total revenue or growth rate in the quarter or even contribution to overall core platform growth to just kind of help us size where we're at with that business?\nAman Bhutani : Yes. For the doms, Trevor, it will be in our Q tomorrow, so you'll see it. And I referenced a bit in my prepared remarks, about some of the pull forward and what we're seeing with gross adds. So there will be some change in terms of the arc of doms. We will see the details in the Q. And Mark, I'll turn it to you for the second part of the question.\nMark McCaffrey : Yes. When you look at the Q4, it's about 2% of the aftermarket contribution that we had last year that we haven't built into this year. Trevor, hopefully, that allows you to size it a bit.\nTrevor Young : Okay. Great. And then a bigger picture one, Aman. Just on like the Managed WordPress, WooCommerce stores, you mentioned going after some of the larger customers and maybe a few million of revs or high single-digit revs. Is that -- those conversions, are they typically coming from a modern competitive solution? Or are they legacy GoDaddy customers that were maybe like a domains and Managed WordPress customer, but had their own payments or commerce integration. And now to your earlier remarks kind of bringing it all into one house, one-stop shop?\nAman Bhutani : Yes. It's still very early, Trevor, in terms of us reaching into our base and attracting customers that sell multiple single-digit millions of dollars -- multiple single million dollars in sales. What I would say we're seeing a bit of everything right now, but the offering we're taking to them is the one-stop shop from their in-store capabilities to their online. They can go to one screen. They can see Amazon, Etsy, Walmart.com, their physical store and all the inventory things and they have it at an amazing price point for our GoDaddy payments just 2.3% plus $0.30 online. We're really got a great package to approach them with. And what we're seeing is interest and good conversion with our new capabilities. And we'll talk much more about our Managed WooCommerce stores product. That's really targeting these larger sellers. And again, it's still early, but you'll see it in general release very, very quickly, and the pilot continues to go well, sort of -- and we're encouraged by the green shoots there.\nTrevor Young : Great. Thank you both.\nAman Bhutani : Thanks, Trevor. I think maybe we will ask Christie, I think the next question is from Matt. Matt, do you want to go ahead?\nUnidentified Analyst : Yes. Great. Thanks. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the presence market. How do you think you're growing relative to the market? Are you seeing share up flat or down? And then some of your competitors in that area have made some material changes to how they're thinking about spending? Has that had any impact on your business?\nAman Bhutani : Yes. Overall, we look at our create and grow products and are quite encouraged with the continued progress there. As we've shared in the past, websites plus marketing, particularly has continued to grow well and really fits a need for our type of customer. The micro business that wants to get up and running faster and website so marketing just produces a really, really good, high performing website for them very, very quickly. So I think we're really encouraged by that. In terms of directional changes from competitors, I think it's still pretty early. We haven't seen a ton of change overall. But our prices for those products are very, very competitive. So we're definitely keeping an eye on it.\nUnidentified Analyst : Great. And just on the -- Mark, you called out some areas that you've heard some things you've done to drive some cost savings. If the macro continues to worsen into next year, how do you think about making other cost adjustments? And where would those cost adjustments be?\nMark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks. And we don't have a crystal ball into next year. And obviously, we don't know if FX is going to be a tailwind or a headwind and continue to watch the depth and the breadth of the recession, especially in Europe. So, a lot of moving parts there. We look quarter-to-quarter. We look at the leverage in our operating expenses. I think we've talked about that before about how we can obtain leverage. We feel really good about the actions we've taken or are taking in Q4 to manage some of that risk. For example, we talked about the energy contract, the AWS contract. But we continue to look at what's in front of us, what we can do, what's within our control. We can find leverage in G&A and care. Obviously, we continue to get more efficient with marketing. I think even in this year, when you take a step back and you look at where we started to where we finished on our normalized EBITDA margin expansion, it's obviously something we are very focused on and continuing to manage as we go through this environment.\nUnidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark, please go ahead.\nAman Bhutani : Hey, Mark.\nMark Zgutowicz: Hey, Christie, Aman and Mark, will question on payable domains. Curious -- I know it's really early here, but I'm curious what sort of are the KPIs that you're looking at initially here? And how long before you will know whether or not there's a payments activation or a potential payments activation to be made? You've got obviously lots of data that you look at in your marketing is always very focused on high-intent attached users. So I'm sort of curious on what data points you're looking for initially? And then just on Apple Pay, maybe very high level, but I'm just curious how you think about how that will contribute to GMV over time? And maybe specifically, if you look at Apple Pay itself as a driver of cart conversion. But just any high-level thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani : Yes, happy to take that, Mark. Just to bring it up a level, if you remember how we introduced GoDaddy payments into websites plus marketing, the first set of metrics we talked about is what percentage of customers were attaching GoDaddy payments to websites plus marketing. It's very similar for payable domains or other services where we're bringing in payments, where the first step we're looking at is when we put this capability in front of new customers, what percentage of those customers sign up for it, take it on. And then, of course, we want to see what percentage of those customers activated and then what GPV they'll transact. What we're doing a little bit differently for payable domains is that at the same time, we've started to expose it to cohorts of customers that are already in our base. So that's one of the examples that I used in my prepared remarks where you can imagine customers that have domain plus e-mail with us, they don't have a website with us. They have domain plus e-mail and they come in to make whatever changes on the website or to their account. And what we're doing is we're catching them at that moment. And we're saying, hey, here's a new thing that's available to you, would you like to try it out? And we saw an attractive percentage of those customers sign up for that and say, yes, I'd like to use it. So in terms of exact time line, I can't tell you how many weeks or months it might take to sort of get an idea. But what we're looking for is those customers and just like new customers in the existing base starting to activate the payable capability, use the failing and then see over time what GPV flows through it. But obviously, we have a large base, and we now have this available for 50% of our domains in the US, which is where we have payments. So it's quite a large opportunity we're going after. And in terms of Apple Pay, I think it's just too early to talk about what changes we might see. We're learning more about that relationship and executing towards it, but it's too early to talk about that.\nMark Zgutowicz: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nJian Li : Hey, guys. Thanks for question. This is Jian Li from Mark Mahaney. Maybe a couple of questions. One is just to circle back on the macro environment. Can you just kind of talk about the demand trends in terms of like the larger users the Pros versus the SMBs? Are the Pros holding up better or is it kind of equal impact across the board? And another question on operating perhaps like on the flip side, I've just kind of noticed a pretty impressive marketing leverage that you guys have had over the past few quarters. I think this is another record low. So if you can kind of talk about, just given the visibility of GoDaddy's core business, given your cash flow position, it almost seems that perhaps there's an opportunity to lean in to marketing if the pricing CPMs are favorable. So if you can talk about the marketing environment you're seeing right now? And kind of how do you think about the spend trajectory? Are you expecting to hold it at this level or be opportunistic?\nMark McCaffrey : I guess, I'll start to handle some of that. Okay. Sorry, all right.\nAman Bhutani : Yes. Sorry, Mark, I was already talking on mute, but if I could jump in.\nMark McCaffrey : Go ahead. Go ahead, Aman.\nAman Bhutani : I think I've got three separate questions there, and maybe, Mark, you can grab a bit of the last one. But just very quickly, Jian, thanks for the questions. On Pros and SMBs, keep in mind, we -- a lot of the Pros that work with GoDaddy tend to be in our hosting business, and that's disproportionately sort of impacted by FX and European exposure. So what we see there has been significant. Mark talked about our international revenue growing 4% and the five points impact of FX there, would have been 9% constant currency. So we definitely see those shifts. But overall, the broader macro, I would say, it's is impacting all kinds of customers in a similar way. But the most important thing for us is that the customers that we bring in continue to have the right intent because what we're really watching is every quarter customer that would bring in, every channel that they come from, are we getting the right renewal rates for those customers because that's what really creates lifetime value for the company. It's not the fast customer that we can just get for a low price that is going to churn very, very quickly. And in terms of marketing leverage, we've talked about it a little bit in the past of how we have pushed all of our marketing channels into sort of the success-based thinking. And it comes in many flavors. It comes in incrementality testing. It comes in sort of AB testing even based on geos. It comes in AB testing in terms of bidding and search, which I've talked about before. And by being very focused on gathering the data, and executing to what the test show, we have been able to trim our marketing spend and focusing on areas that bring us the best returns with the best intent customers. And in terms of leaning into marketing and doing more there, absolutely, I always say I would love to spend more in marketing every time. I just want it to continue to deliver the returns that we're asking for. So as long as it's within our guidelines, we definitely look for new channels, new areas where we can spend up more and attract more customers. And Mark, I'll turn it to you. I'm not sure, if what I interrupt you.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. No, no. I think you covered a lot of it, Aman, and I think you hit the high points, but I'll add. We continue to look at marketing as a tool based on the ROI we see in front of us. And we're always balancing our decisions today and how we invest while keeping an eye on the long term and our stated objectives. So we're trying to be disciplined in our approach, but yet look for the ROI and the opportunity to take advantage of it when it comes.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mili Das on behalf of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Mili, please go ahead.\nMili Das: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, if you could provide more color on fiscal year 2023. I know you guys are still in the planning process, but are there any key priorities we should be thinking about into next year? And can we expect any large investment initiatives? Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: So we're looking forward to talking to everybody early next year about our 2023 outlook, but I'll give it a step back here in talk about kind of 2022 and where we're going and the momentum we have going into 2023. When we talk about \u2013 our first meeting this year on Investor Day, we had a lot of momentum going into the year, but we couldn't predict the macroeconomic environment that was out there. As we sit here today, we're looking at, targeting 7% growth for the year, 9% on constant currency, and we really like the momentum going into 2023 as it stands. Even in Q4, we always knew Q4 was going to be a tough comparable for us but you take the growth rate, you added a couple of points for FX. You add a couple of points for the aftermarket over performance that we've taken out, and we really have a lot of momentum going in around our products and some of the stuff Aman has talked about. So, looking forward to talking a little bit more as we get into 2023, and what we're seeing out there. But right now, we are really happy with how we're performing in 2022 and the momentum we have. And just to add to that, being able to expand our normalized EBITDA margins during this period and at the same time hit our cash flow targets and cash flow per share targets, we like the long-term outlook out there.\nMili Das: Great. Thank you so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Bolton on behalf of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Alex, please go ahead.\nAaron Kessler: I think, it actually Aaron. Hey, guys.\nMark McCaffrey: Hey, Aaron.\nAaron Kessler: Can you just talk about maybe the \u2013 talk a little bit about the shift to cloud and kind of what's your progress in terms of that shift to cloud services and the impact on OpEx that we should be thinking about over the next year or so?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I'm happy to share, Aaron that we've continued to shift more of our applications into the cloud. It gives us a much stronger ability to \u2013 and greater velocity to put more products out there much, much faster and manage scale much, much better. I'll let Mark talk about sort of some of the OpEx CapEx type sort of change there. But overall, we're very happy with the relationship we have. We've just renegotiated a contract. Our teams work very well together, and almost all of our teams are using the cloud in some way, shape or form. Mark, I'll turn to you for OpEx.\nMark McCaffrey: All right. Thanks. Hi, Aaron, how are you doing? Listen, early on, and we'll get more clarity as we talk to you in early 2023, but the way I would look at it right now is, we have pressure around increased energy costs, especially coming out of Europe right now. We talked about the contract we signed to secure our cost for next year. But the AWS contract really allows us to negate any future impacts around energy costs. And I think from an operating expense point of view, we're looking at it to kind of cover us as we go into 2023, if that makes any sense.\nAaron Kessler: Yes, it does. Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Hi, Naved. I think you are on mute.\nNaved Khan: Can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner: We can hear you now.\nNaved Khan: Great. Yes. So two questions. One, are any of the costs associated with your European business kind of based out of the US or in US dollars that might be hurting the margin somewhat. And the other question is just around the price testing you guys have been doing, any \u2013 are you seeing any stickiness in that any kind of pushback? Any color would be great? Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes, nothing to really call out in the data centers and the US dollars or the EMEA part of it. A lot of our European customers are based on European data centers. So obviously, there is some FX impact, but nothing really to call out too significant on the margins.\nAman Bhutani: And then on price testing, Naved, we've continued to test price. And you'll continue to see us do it where we continue to be nuanced in our approach on pricing looking to balance both what's happening sort of macro-economically or within a geo versus also our ability to take share and push in versus take price. So we'll continue to make -- do that approach and we'll continue to guide to the plans that we have, for example, for 2023, you'll hear about them. They'll be within the \u2013 as we talk about 2023 in February.\nNaved Khan: Okay. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of John Van [ph] on behalf of Brent Thill from Jefferies. John, please go ahead. Hi, John, I think you are un-mute. \nUnidentified Analyst: A -couple of questions, one more on the macro. It does seem like the tone get a little bit more cautious and just wondering, how they've progressed maybe over time in October? And where are you seeing some of the more incremental caution? And then the second question, on the payable domains, I know it's early, but wondering how the behavior is the first time they turn it on and it just trying it out? Or is it like follow-on usage? Any sort of anecdotal that would be great.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, John. Maybe taking the second part first. On payable domains, it's super early. What I talked about in my prepared remarks is that in the US, we have now technically enabled half the domains under management as payable. We still have to put that in merchandise that to customers and activate them. But I give an example or 2 of how we're doing that both in the new path and in the existing customers, engaging them. So we're very excited about getting this capability to customer, very excited about some of the attach rates we're seeing. But in terms of customers actually starting to use it and GPV flowing, it will take a little bit of time for us to truly understand what that usage is going to look like. And to take a step back to talk about the overall macro, I think the word that describes it well is that it's been an uneven macro environment for two-plus years now, right? And I'm really proud of what the GoDaddy team has achieved and what we've been able to do. I feel we've navigated that environment very, very well. We've attracted great customers. We continue to have greater than 85% retention rates for customers. We're sitting \u2013 we came into 2022 with a lot of uncertainty as well. And we're sitting here with 9% constant currency revenue growth and lots of new products coming into the market in commerce and payments, we word press with websites plus marketing having plan down to even the free plan with payable domains with the registry business. So it's just a lot of good for us to look forward to. And we're taking all of that momentum with us into 2023. And we've highlighted the areas where we see some risks, and we always call it like we see it. right? But at the core, GoDaddy is a market leader. We have a durable business. Our customers are resilient, which leads to us having a resilient business. Our core competitive advantages around our unmatched scale Sage guidance we gave in customer care, that customer care is great for us to attach products, and we'll give you examples of that. And we're building technology that works for our customer for the micro and small business, which is seamless, which is intuitive which helps saves them time, help save them money. And we have pricing like example payments that -- or even in websites marketing, that is very, very competitive in the market. And ultimately, we put the customer at the center of what we're doing. We're staying close to the customer. We're pruning stewards of the P&L. We're investing in areas that are the biggest growth initiatives for us as a company. And we're running the business for long-term profitable and sustainable growth. That's sort of our view, and that's how we see it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for the color.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: I will now turn the call over to Aman for any closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. Thank you all for your questions. Thank you to all GoDaddy employees for all the hard work for another good quarter, and I look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all, championing micro and small business customers. One of our customers, Tyron Harper, co-owner of Harp Vision, was recently asked, what happens if Harp Vision doesn't succeed? His response was I never thought about it. I only thought about it succeeding. Every day we are inspired by our customers. I know we make a difference in their lives and in uncertain times our mission becomes even more important. None of us have a crystal ball to perfectly predict the future, but I can tell you that our customers are creative and resilient. In a recent survey, while more of our customers expressed a negative near-term outlook they generally remained a positive group with two-thirds of them reporting optimism about their business. Today, we are pleased to announce our Q3 results with 7% revenue growth, 15% growth in normalized EBITDA, and continued strong customer retention of more than 85%. These achievements are noteworthy given the continued negative foreign currency impact, uneven demand patterns, and lower consumer confidence. Our core competitive advantages of high global brand awareness to attract customers, sage guidance through Care to help retain customers, and seamlessly intuitive experiences to deliver mission-critical products and services to our customers uniquely position GoDaddy to weather economic challenges from a position of strength. While we are not immune to economic turbulence, we are committed to action and attention on what we can control. As in previous quarters, we will be prudent with our cost structure. Day to day, that comes down to focusing on success-based marketing, monitoring headcount and directing investments on the most important growth initiatives, including simplification and automation. This formula helps us deliver a great service efficiently. Maintaining strong cohort retention, driving new customer adds, increasing ARPU and extending commerce and payments attach are all important to achieving our long-term goals. In Q3, we continued to drive strong retention that is in-line with our past cohort performance. This demonstrates that through the varying economic cycles over the past couple of years, we successfully attracted the customers that have the right intent, those customers that can grow and attach more with us over time thus benefiting GoDaddy's ARPU. On gross adds, the data over the last few months suggests that there was a pull-forward during peak COVID times, though the magnitude of this is hard to calculate until normal seasonality returns to the business. As a result, gross adds and domains under management are not expected to follow the same historical arc as in recent years. Countering this, we are encouraged by our ability to maintain strong retention, increase ARPU, and continue the growth and momentum we are driving in our commerce and payments business within our existing customer base. Our strategic priorities remain consistent; first, driving commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in domains. Beginning with presence, this quarter we added simplified site creation through improved guidance on template selection, making it easier for customers to start building an online presence. This update drove higher publish rates, which is an important indicator of customer success and increased lifetime value. You have heard me regularly talk about bringing Commerce to every surface at GoDaddy. Keeping with that, we have enabled payments in all Websites + Marketing plans, including our free plan. This shows up in the form of \u2018Buy Buttons' making it easier for nascent businesses, side-hustles, and the like to get started with our Commerce offering. Our goal here is to build the Commerce relationship with our customers as early as possible and then expand this relationship over time. These customers want a simple, inexpensive way to start taking payments. This functionality allows for that, while providing the lowest-in-industry online transaction rate of 2.3% +$0.30. Lastly, we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of our OmniCommerce solution, and I wanted to spend a moment to acknowledge all that we have accomplished in this area since the release. We have been very ambitious in building out these capabilities because our customers tell us that they prefer a single one-stop shop solution. We believe our connected commerce solution is poised to win at a greater rate because it is adding value for our customers while saving them time and money. We made notable updates in user experience, eCommerce value and a disruptive payments experience. We added in-store, point-of-sale and Online Store inventory sync with omni-channel reporting for merchants across all channels. Our customers can clearly see their sales across their physical store, their online store, third party marketplaces and social media platforms including Amazon, Etsy, Walmart.com and others. We've added Pay Buttons, integrated shipping labels, Apple Pay and a new Commerce Plus plan for Websites + Marketing, for up and running businesses that need sales tax automation. And our customers can use Mobile app QR Code Payments and Apple Pay for eCommerce. We have also expanded our payments and commerce experience into Woo Commerce for Managed WordPress, while also actively rolling out our Managed Woo Commerce Stores solution allowing us to serve larger customers. We started with larger customers doing up to a million dollars in sales, and we are finding that we can effectively serve high single digit million sellers as well, and we already have these customers in our base. It is still early days but we have made good progress in identifying, converting and activating these larger sellers. Attaching to our existing base is key to our long-term ambition with GoDaddy Commerce and GoDaddy Payments. We are learning a lot about the sales and implementation cycle to serve these customers and we will provide more updates over time. We know that customers who engage in commerce and payments are generally stickier and have over 80x higher lifetime value. We have continued to see positive momentum in new customers attaching GoDaddy Payments within in Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. These serve as consistent proof points that our customers want this capability from us, and it can fuel our growth and customer retention for years to come. Moving on to GoDaddy Pros, this quarter we launched free SSL on nearly all new web hosting plans in our major markets including the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India. Early data shows that this is driving increased term lengths and modest improvements in new units and bookings in our hosting business. While the macro and FX challenges on our hosting business are meaningful, we are focused on what we can control, making the product better for our customers. Along with free SSL, we have continued to improve server response time by rolling out infrastructure improvements across multiple hosting platforms. We have also continued to update GoDaddy's Pro Hub, putting a more competitive offering in the marketplace. Our hosting business in Europe is also exposed to rising energy costs and to mitigate that we secured a fixed power contract. Our third priority is innovation in Domains. The rollout of Payable Domains is going well with half of our domains now technically enabled as payable and ready for activation by customers. The first cohort of existing customers we exposed Payable Domains to were logged in domain plus email customers. These customers were identified as likely to have high intent and they have engaged with Payable Domains at an attractive rate. It is still too early to calculate how much usage Payable Domains will have for non-website customers, but we are encouraged by this beginning and moving as quickly as we can to merchandise it to more customers. We also released a new Auctions user experience that improves the buying experience with new bulk bidding and Buy-It-Now options, improved uptime, and a simpler and consistent design. We also launched a Domain Portfolio Manager for all customers giving them modern domain management capabilities aimed at increasing their efficiency and ease of use. While we are learning more about how the macro environment impacts the Aftermarket, we continue to focus on what we control, which is to improve the experience for domain investor customers and integrate Dan.com's capabilities into the broader GoDaddy secondary market. In closing, we look forward to finishing the year steadfast in our commitment of executing against our strategic priorities and working to achieve our long-term financial goals. As we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to be a leader in our space, with ample growth opportunities and the ability to participate in our customers' success. History has shown that companies that continue to innovate and invest appropriately during an economic downturn can exit the other side in an even better position. We will stay close to our customers, we will understand their greatest needs and we will delight them with guided Care, constantly innovating towards a seamless experience making our solutions stickier leading to greater customer lifetime value. With that, here's Mark. Thanks Mark. Taking a step back, we are incredibly proud of the work our teams are doing as we are making progress against our stated priorities. GoDaddy has a proven, focused strategy, executed by an experienced team that will act proactively and decisively through a fluid macro-economic environment to create long-term value for shareholders. Despite these headwinds and the tough compare in Q4, the full year is on track to deliver 7% growth or 9% on a constant currency basis. Coupled with the momentum we are driving in commerce, we are excited about what's to come in 2023 and beyond. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team to open up the call for questions. Thanks, Elizabeth, this is Aman. I'm happy to take that question. When we talk about the unevenness of demand or the broader macro, if we take a step back, it's been kind of uneven for two plus years, Mark mentioned, sort of some of the September/October data as well. But I, when I look back, I see us navigating the last two years really well, our cohorts have continued to be consistent at about 85% retention or higher, and here we are without sort of, we came into 2022 with uncertainty. And it has been there has been quite a lot of uncertainty where we're sitting at 9%, constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins. We're taking all of that momentum with us into 2023. Are there regions of an unevenness by geography, like you said, or by month or by customer segment? Yes, that's absolutely there. And just to touch on Europe a bit, as we did last quarter, it's broadly similar, as we talked about last quarter, in the UK, in Germany are big markets for us there. So, clearly, we feel a bigger impact there. But we're watching the US very, very carefully. And we're watching our cohorts very, very quick, carefully. But we're taking all this momentum into 2023 and we're excited, we got a lot of new product on the table, a lot of new capabilities that in commerce and payments, WordPress improvements payable domains registry, like there's so much for us to look forward to that. I think we're just going to watch the numbers very carefully and make good decisions. And I'll turn it to Mark, I don't know, Mark, if you'd like to add something? Yes, I'm happy to quickly touch on that. First, overall, our cohorts are performing consistently, ARPU is rising and continues to do well obviously we'll talk about it more at the end of the year. But our focus is to attract the customers with the right intent that want to use activate the products that we have. So that we continue to maintain that high customer retention rate. And as long as those cohorts form and customers are retained, we know that in any short to mid-term cycles may push customer demand up or down a bit. But over the long-term customers need the products we have. We deliver critical products to them at amazing prices and we know these products are core to their needs. So, short-term up and down is okay. But overall, I think ARPU -- the ARPU, numbers are showing that we're attracting the right customer. Yes. For the doms, Trevor, it will be in our Q tomorrow, so you'll see it. And I referenced a bit in my prepared remarks, about some of the pull forward and what we're seeing with gross adds. So there will be some change in terms of the arc of doms. We will see the details in the Q. And Mark, I'll turn it to you for the second part of the question. Yes. It's still very early, Trevor, in terms of us reaching into our base and attracting customers that sell multiple single-digit millions of dollars -- multiple single million dollars in sales. What I would say we're seeing a bit of everything right now, but the offering we're taking to them is the one-stop shop from their in-store capabilities to their online. They can go to one screen. They can see Amazon, Etsy, Walmart.com, their physical store and all the inventory things and they have it at an amazing price point for our GoDaddy payments just 2.3% plus $0.30 online. We're really got a great package to approach them with. And what we're seeing is interest and good conversion with our new capabilities. And we'll talk much more about our Managed WooCommerce stores product. That's really targeting these larger sellers. And again, it's still early, but you'll see it in general release very, very quickly, and the pilot continues to go well, sort of -- and we're encouraged by the green shoots there. Thanks, Trevor. I think maybe we will ask Christie, I think the next question is from Matt. Matt, do you want to go ahead? Yes. Overall, we look at our create and grow products and are quite encouraged with the continued progress there. As we've shared in the past, websites plus marketing, particularly has continued to grow well and really fits a need for our type of customer. The micro business that wants to get up and running faster and website so marketing just produces a really, really good, high performing website for them very, very quickly. So I think we're really encouraged by that. In terms of directional changes from competitors, I think it's still pretty early. We haven't seen a ton of change overall. But our prices for those products are very, very competitive. So we're definitely keeping an eye on it. Hey, Mark. Yes, happy to take that, Mark. Just to bring it up a level, if you remember how we introduced GoDaddy payments into websites plus marketing, the first set of metrics we talked about is what percentage of customers were attaching GoDaddy payments to websites plus marketing. It's very similar for payable domains or other services where we're bringing in payments, where the first step we're looking at is when we put this capability in front of new customers, what percentage of those customers sign up for it, take it on. And then, of course, we want to see what percentage of those customers activated and then what GPV they'll transact. What we're doing a little bit differently for payable domains is that at the same time, we've started to expose it to cohorts of customers that are already in our base. So that's one of the examples that I used in my prepared remarks where you can imagine customers that have domain plus e-mail with us, they don't have a website with us. They have domain plus e-mail and they come in to make whatever changes on the website or to their account. And what we're doing is we're catching them at that moment. And we're saying, hey, here's a new thing that's available to you, would you like to try it out? And we saw an attractive percentage of those customers sign up for that and say, yes, I'd like to use it. So in terms of exact time line, I can't tell you how many weeks or months it might take to sort of get an idea. But what we're looking for is those customers and just like new customers in the existing base starting to activate the payable capability, use the failing and then see over time what GPV flows through it. But obviously, we have a large base, and we now have this available for 50% of our domains in the US, which is where we have payments. So it's quite a large opportunity we're going after. And in terms of Apple Pay, I think it's just too early to talk about what changes we might see. We're learning more about that relationship and executing towards it, but it's too early to talk about that. Yes. Sorry, Mark, I was already talking on mute, but if I could jump in. I think I've got three separate questions there, and maybe, Mark, you can grab a bit of the last one. But just very quickly, Jian, thanks for the questions. On Pros and SMBs, keep in mind, we -- a lot of the Pros that work with GoDaddy tend to be in our hosting business, and that's disproportionately sort of impacted by FX and European exposure. So what we see there has been significant. Mark talked about our international revenue growing 4% and the five points impact of FX there, would have been 9% constant currency. So we definitely see those shifts. But overall, the broader macro, I would say, it's is impacting all kinds of customers in a similar way. But the most important thing for us is that the customers that we bring in continue to have the right intent because what we're really watching is every quarter customer that would bring in, every channel that they come from, are we getting the right renewal rates for those customers because that's what really creates lifetime value for the company. It's not the fast customer that we can just get for a low price that is going to churn very, very quickly. And in terms of marketing leverage, we've talked about it a little bit in the past of how we have pushed all of our marketing channels into sort of the success-based thinking. And it comes in many flavors. It comes in incrementality testing. It comes in sort of AB testing even based on geos. It comes in AB testing in terms of bidding and search, which I've talked about before. And by being very focused on gathering the data, and executing to what the test show, we have been able to trim our marketing spend and focusing on areas that bring us the best returns with the best intent customers. And in terms of leaning into marketing and doing more there, absolutely, I always say I would love to spend more in marketing every time. I just want it to continue to deliver the returns that we're asking for. So as long as it's within our guidelines, we definitely look for new channels, new areas where we can spend up more and attract more customers. And Mark, I'll turn it to you. I'm not sure, if what I interrupt you. Yes. I'm happy to share, Aaron that we've continued to shift more of our applications into the cloud. It gives us a much stronger ability to \u2013 and greater velocity to put more products out there much, much faster and manage scale much, much better. I'll let Mark talk about sort of some of the OpEx CapEx type sort of change there. But overall, we're very happy with the relationship we have. We've just renegotiated a contract. Our teams work very well together, and almost all of our teams are using the cloud in some way, shape or form. Mark, I'll turn to you for OpEx. And then on price testing, Naved, we've continued to test price. And you'll continue to see us do it where we continue to be nuanced in our approach on pricing looking to balance both what's happening sort of macro-economically or within a geo versus also our ability to take share and push in versus take price. So we'll continue to make -- do that approach and we'll continue to guide to the plans that we have, for example, for 2023, you'll hear about them. They'll be within the \u2013 as we talk about 2023 in February. Yes. Thanks, John. Maybe taking the second part first. On payable domains, it's super early.

Thank you to all GoDaddy employees for all the hard work for another good quarter, and I look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks Aman and thank you everyone for joining us today. In Q3, GoDaddy delivered solid results despite increasing currency and macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue was $1.03 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 4% on a reported basis, and 9% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 13%, within the guided range of 13 to 15% on the strength of our Create + Grow and our Commerce products as well as email attach. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 10% to more than $1.2 billion and within that, the ARR from our Create and Grow products grew 7% to nearly $430 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $29 billion. Core Platform revenue grew 5%, within the target range of 4% to 6%, primarily due to growth in the Aftermarket and increased pricing in domains, offset by a modest decrease in our hosting business. As Aman noted above, the hosting business has concentration and exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for Core Platform grew 2% to $2.3 billion. Q3 Bookings totaled $1.09 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 10% and Core Platform bookings grew 3% on similar growth factors noted for revenue. Normalized EBITDA grew 15% to $263 million, a margin rate of 25%, representing a 180 basis point expansion, year-over-year. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. Unlevered Free Cash Flow for the quarter totaled $297 million, growing 18% driven by strong profitability. Additionally, year-to-date we completed $1.15 billion of share buybacks, repurchasing 14.8 million shares, and reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 9% since year end. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.96 on a trailing twelve-month basis, versus prior year cash flow per share of $4.94, a 21% increase driven by strong cash flow and share repurchases. On the balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $826 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt stands at $3.1 billion, at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range of two to four times. Additionally, in October, we announced a new term loan facility of $1.8 billion, the proceeds of which are to be used to pay down our existing term loans due in 2024. The pending term loan facility contemplates a maturity date of 2029 and pricing based on SOFR + 325 basis points. We also announced our intent to increase the borrowing capacity under our existing $600 million revolving credit facility to a $1 billion facility maturing in 2027. These transactions, which are scheduled to close in Q4, are subject to customary closing conditions and would meaningfully increase our total liquidity. The cash interest payments under these transactions would increase our interest payments by roughly $35 million for 2023, resulting in expected annual interest of approximately $165 million. Moving on to our outlook, we are targeting Q4 total revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, representing growth of 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. As we previously discussed, the macro environment and FX has shifted since our initial guide in February. Additionally, we are facing a tough compare in our Aftermarket business. While our Aftermarket business showed strength in the fourth quarter last year, the demand for high value sales has been difficult to predict due to its short lead times and fast close rates. Our current guide does not factor in the same strength we experienced last year due to the current macro trends. Said simply, we do not expect Aftermarket demand in Q4 to enable the same revenue out performance we achieved in the year-ago quarter. Also, assuming a continuation of today's currency rates, we expect the adverse FX impact will be an incremental $5 million from our Q2 guide, for an incremental $40 million adverse impact from our initial February guide. Flowing through these factors into our segments, we expect some impact to our Applications and Commerce segment from uneven demand experienced in September and October. As a result, we expect this segment to grow between 10% and 12% for Q4 putting Applications and Commerce revenue growth at the low to mid-end of our range of 13% to 15% for the year. In Core Platform we expect revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year in Q4 on the impacts of Hosting and FX pressure mentioned previously as well as a tough compare in Aftermarket, which results in Core Platform revenue growth between 4 and 6% for the full year. Normalized EBITDA for Q4 is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million and remain within the targeted range of 24% to 25% for both the quarter and the year end, above our initial range of 23% to 24% provided in February. We expect our unlevered free cash flow for the year to be between $1.09 and $1.1 billion, putting our cash flow per share at $6 plus in line with the outlook shared in February. Our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We continued our buyback program during Q3 and will continue to evaluate use-of-cash options for the remainder of the year, in line with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Our attractive model and robust free cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest in our business at a time when others may have to pull back more aggressively, and to return cash to shareholders through our buyback program. At the same time, we remain disciplined on how and where we spend, with a focus on controlling our costs, optimizing our marketing spend, monitoring headcount and investing in tech so that we can strike the right balance between capturing attractive opportunities with delivering profits to our shareholders. Always with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. On our cost structure, last quarter we shared that we are focused on acting in areas we could control. Committed to that goal, we executed a couple of important contracts to reduce or mitigate exposure to increased costs. In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Amazon Web Services to continue to migrate workloads and development to the cloud. This contract will reduce our overall costs in the form of long-term capital spend and energy expenses while giving us the agility to launch new products at a faster pace. On energy costs, as Aman mentioned earlier, we secured a contract in Europe at a guaranteed rate for the next year, giving us mid-term stability on these costs impacting our European data centers. Lastly, as noted earlier, we are currently refinancing our 2024 debt to extend our due date to 2029 and limit our exposure to further interest rate increases. Through this anticipated new debt, we continue to expect our leverage ratio to remain between two to four times. We are committed to remaining transparent, and we will provide an update with our latest thoughts on key business trends when we share our 2023 guidance early next year. Like so many other companies, we are operating in a fluid environment and are not immune to its challenges. In closing, while the short-term revenue outlook is dynamic, we have continued confidence in our ability to execute. We believe our competitive position and strategic advantages, our diverse product offerings, our strong balance sheet and the consistent and predictable cash flow we generate places GoDaddy as a leader amongst its peers. While the range of outcomes is somewhat wider today than at points in the past, we are creating a track record as a responsible management team that can and will lead in good times and in tougher times, allowing our business to perform across economic cycles. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We will continue to focus on execution against our strategic priorities, tightly managing our business and building deeper customer relationships as we partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Aman. No, I think that's a good response. Aman, and just kind of bringing it home. I think it's more pronounced in Europe, no doubt, in UK, and Germany, like Amman mentioned, but then overall, looking at Q4 and the outperformance of aftermarket last year versus this year, we're not seeing the same demand around the larger deals, we see a lot of supply and demand. But these things are short to come and quick to close. And we've taken that out of our guide for Q4, because we just don't see it in front of us right now. So, I think that when you talk about demand overall, that's something you have to call out. And Aman, I'll add. I think the one-stop shop, the area is really coming to play. And I know we've talked about commerce and the attach we're seeing at the front of the funnel. But we're also seeing the competitive pricing in our existing customer base start to take hold. And I think Elizabeth going to your to your question, it really shows that in this market, dealing with a one-stop shop is a competitive advantage, and we're seeing customers really be attracted to that, not only new customers, but existing customers as well. Yes. When you look at the Q4, it's about 2% of the aftermarket contribution that we had last year that we haven't built into this year. Trevor, hopefully, that allows you to size it a bit. Yes. Thanks. And we don't have a crystal ball into next year. And obviously, we don't know if FX is going to be a tailwind or a headwind and continue to watch the depth and the breadth of the recession, especially in Europe. So, a lot of moving parts there. We look quarter-to-quarter. We look at the leverage in our operating expenses. I think we've talked about that before about how we can obtain leverage. We feel really good about the actions we've taken or are taking in Q4 to manage some of that risk. For example, we talked about the energy contract, the AWS contract. But we continue to look at what's in front of us, what we can do, what's within our control. We can find leverage in G&A and care. Obviously, we continue to get more efficient with marketing. I think even in this year, when you take a step back and you look at where we started to where we finished on our normalized EBITDA margin expansion, it's obviously something we are very focused on and continuing to manage as we go through this environment. I guess, I'll start to handle some of that. Okay. Sorry, all right. Go ahead. Go ahead, Aman. Yes. No, no. I think you covered a lot of it, Aman, and I think you hit the high points, but I'll add. We continue to look at marketing as a tool based on the ROI we see in front of us. And we're always balancing our decisions today and how we invest while keeping an eye on the long term and our stated objectives. So we're trying to be disciplined in our approach, but yet look for the ROI and the opportunity to take advantage of it when it comes. So we're looking forward to talking to everybody early next year about our 2023 outlook, but I'll give it a step back here in talk about kind of 2022 and where we're going and the momentum we have going into 2023. When we talk about \u2013 our first meeting this year on Investor Day, we had a lot of momentum going into the year, but we couldn't predict the macroeconomic environment that was out there. As we sit here today, we're looking at, targeting 7% growth for the year, 9% on constant currency, and we really like the momentum going into 2023 as it stands. Even in Q4, we always knew Q4 was going to be a tough comparable for us but you take the growth rate, you added a couple of points for FX. You add a couple of points for the aftermarket over performance that we've taken out, and we really have a lot of momentum going in around our products and some of the stuff Aman has talked about. So, looking forward to talking a little bit more as we get into 2023, and what we're seeing out there. But right now, we are really happy with how we're performing in 2022 and the momentum we have. And just to add to that, being able to expand our normalized EBITDA margins during this period and at the same time hit our cash flow targets and cash flow per share targets, we like the long-term outlook out there. Hey, Aaron. All right. Thanks. Hi, Aaron, how are you doing? Listen, early on, and we'll get more clarity as we talk to you in early 2023, but the way I would look at it right now is, we have pressure around increased energy costs, especially coming out of Europe right now. We talked about the contract we signed to secure our cost for next year. But the AWS contract really allows us to negate any future impacts around energy costs. And I think from an operating expense point of view, we're looking at it to kind of cover us as we go into 2023, if that makes any sense. Yes, nothing to really call out in the data centers and the US dollars or the EMEA part of it. A lot of our European customers are based on European data centers. So obviously, there is some FX impact, but nothing really to call out too significant on the margins."

Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today August 3, 2022 and except to the extent required by law we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. The best moments of my week are when I'm engaging with GoDaddy customers. I am constantly inspired by their grit and determination and amazed by their resilience. Just a couple of weeks ago, I spoke at a small business summit. I've met so many GoDaddy customers there and some who will hopefully become GoDaddy customers in the future. While they're worried about the current economic environment, I found them driven, ambitious, upbeat and passionate about their businesses. One customer walked up to me and started with my life is on GoDaddy. I am inspired to do more for her and all our customers to be better every day. Our relentless focus on innovation, deliver seamless and intuitive technology complemented by human care helping customers grow their businesses and achieve their dreams. Our strategy to attract high-value customers continue to show success best illustrated by our customer retention rates, which have remained greater than 85%. The Q2 results demonstrate our steady operating discipline, 9% growth in revenue and 30% growth in normalized EBITDA despite the challenging FX environment. GoDaddy's strong and diverse business enables us to navigate fluid global demand patterns and inflation concerns from a solid position and we are committed to attention and action on what we control. As in the past, we aligned our marketing spend and other investments with demand signals, concentrating on success-based, disciplined and efficient spending. We actively identify and deploy marketing spend where we find opportunities to deliver long-term growth. Through this plan we create balance across all components of our business without sacrificing our investment in technology and development for future growth. Our strategic priorities have been consistent over the past six quarters. First, driving Commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in Domains. Beginning with Commerce, we are pleased to share that we continue to achieve positive trajectory with our GoDaddy Payments offering and more specifically the attach rates to our other products. For Websites + Marketing, more than 80% of our Commerce customers choose our payment solution and for Managed WordPress, 30% of our Commerce customers choose our payment solution. Annualized GMV also continues to rise with Q2 at $28 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. We continue to drive strong sales in payment hardware devices enabling robust in-store capabilities for customers, while also steadily approving payment applications. While our payments offering is still relatively new, GoDaddy's differentiated OmniCommerce solution is well-positioned in this space. Regardless of the consumers' preferences whether they are shopping online or in person, our solutions empowers our customers to benefit from our industry-low transaction rates in all locations. We also rolled out Apple Pay on GoDaddy Payments improving the buying experience and Apple selected GoDaddy as a Tap to Pay partner. We are excited to work with Apple to bring Tap to Pay on iPhone to GoDaddy customers later this year. And as always we will share more information about this partnership as it becomes more meaningful. We embedded more capabilities within Websites plus Marketing plans to make it easier for entrepreneurs to market their products, sell online, manage their business and grow. New capabilities include product image enhancement, including background removal, quick view and buy capabilities enabling single-click add to cart, integrated discounting shipping labels, online appointment features making calendaring and appointments more intuitive. Enhancing our products helps our customers grow their business while building retention and creating greater lifetime value for GoDaddy. We also continue to test price increases for our highly competitive and feature-rich Websites plus Marketing product. Our approach to pricing is nuanced taking into consideration the right balance of increased price and market share while also closely monitoring shifts in customer behavior due to macro factors. We have limited the use of heavy discounting programs that frequent this space while maintaining our competitive position by offering products that our customers value. Our customer retention rates remain strong with consistent 15-month cohort retention, which is trending higher than prior year cohorts. And our overall customer retention metric has stayed above 85% even as we observe some pressure for customers due to macro factors. This is something we are extremely proud of because it is a sign that we continue to deliver for an often left behind customer the micro businesses that are the backbone of their local communities. We are proud that Websites plus Marketing delivers websites for customers that are highly performant. We have pushed the bar further on that and have implemented significant behind-the-scenes changes that result in improved website performance for millions of sites. These powerful improvements enable GoDaddy customers to achieve improved paid speed insights and Core Web Vitals scores. For example, our Core Web Vitals pass rate for our customers' sites increased by 75% making us the leader in this category. These improvements ensure GoDaddy's customers' websites rank higher in search results. And for small businesses this is extremely important. Moving on to GoDaddy Pros. This quarter we launched a beta WooSaaS solution to allow us to reach a larger customers those with sales of $1 million to a few million dollars. These larger customers will be able to sell anywhere including in-person on their online store and in online marketplaces and social platforms and benefit from omnichannel payment processing all managed in one place. This new online store offering provides growing merchants virtually infinite flexibility of WordPress plus WooCommerce combined with highly performing scalable and secure cloud hosting technology and a seamless intuitive and comprehensive software user experience. The fully managed technology stack allows our customers to focus on running their business. We brought together a team of experts in multiple technology domains to create this new premium offering which includes exclusive functionality with free premium extensions and exclusive capabilities such as an expert level dedicated support team. Our customers want a one-stop shop offering from us and WooSaaS solution is the latest proof point of GoDaddy's ability to move slightly up market over time. The beta program started in Q2 with an invite-only group of WooCommerce merchants and partners testing the integration and unification of multiple acquired technologies to offer a seamlessly managed all-in-one experience for WooCommerce stores. We are excited about the possibilities and looking forward to a full marketing launch. On our third priority, we are excited about the upcoming full launch of Payable Domains in Q3 a limited pilot program in Q2 focused on learnings demonstrated that customers value the offering. We also saw some green shoots in terms of meaningful GPV in the pilot being driven by customers without a website. In our Q3 launch, Payable Domains will be included for free and by default with every domain purchase creating a frictionless out-of-the-box experience for new businesses. We believe this will simplify the online payments process for our customers by giving them a professional branded checkout experience and the freedom to accept online payments without needing any other subscription. In closing, I want to acknowledge that while we are all in uncertain times GoDaddy's relentless focus on executing against our strategic priorities, delivering for our customers, building seamless and intuitive technology for our customers to succeed backed by human care, our scale and vast portfolio of offerings steadily drives GoDaddy's consistent financial results. Our incredible customers inspire us to continue to innovate and do even more for them. We will continue to be prudent stewards of capital investing behind long-term growth drivers and staying committed to delivering value to our customers, employees and shareholders. With that here's Mark. \nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman and thank you, everyone for joining us today. GoDaddy's resiliency and durable top line growth, profitability at scale and robust cash flow are evident in our Q2 financial results and enable GoDaddy to continue to invest to deliver long-term value while returning excess capital to investors in the form of share buybacks. Revenue in Q2 was $1 billion, growing 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the currency impact, our reported revenue would have come in at the high end of our Q2 guidance. Within total revenue international revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 15% within the target range of 14% to 16%, driven by continued strength in our Create and Grow products and Email attach. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 12% to more than $1.2 billion. And within that the ARR from our Create and Grow products grew 10% to $420 million. Additionally annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $28 billion, growing 12%. Core platform revenue grew 7% delivering at the high end of our 5% to 7% Q2 guidance, primarily due to strength in domain registration, aftermarket and security, offset by a slight decrease in our hosting business. ARR for our core platform grew 5% to $2.3 billion. Q2 bookings totaled $1.12 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 10% and core platform bookings grew 4% on similar growth factors noted for revenue. Normalized EBITDA grew 30% to $258 million. Our 25% margin represented over four points of margin expansion primarily because of expanded gross margins on product mix and reduced marketing spend. The decreased marketing spend is the result of disciplined moderation of our investment as we zero in on success-based marketing and flex our spending to capture attractive returns. Our technology and development expenses increased as a percent of revenue this quarter as we advanced our commerce and innovation strategies. Lastly, we recognized a $10 million impairment charge related to IT licenses and facilities as we continue to simplify our infrastructure. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $274 million. growing 16% driven by strong profitability. Additionally, year-to-date, we completed $1 billion of share buybacks, repurchasing 12.8 million shares and reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 8% since year-end. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.67 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year cash flow per share of $4.78, a 19% increase on strong cash flow and share repurchases. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $770 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt stands at $3.1 billion, at the midpoint of our targeted range of two to four times. Moving on to our outlook. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in the second half of 2022, and are on target to meet our full year operational and strategic goals, including our targets around normalized EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, and cash flow per share. With that said, we are not immune to the macro environment of the strengthening dollar and the impact that it has on our top line performance. Assuming a continuation of today's rates, over the rest of the year, we expect that the adverse FX impact for the full year to be approximately $35 million or approximately 1%, compared to our full year revenue guidance issued in February. As a result, we revised our 2022 full year revenue outlook to $4.1 billion to $4.13 billion. We remain focused on driving strong financial results, and are committed to delivering $1.1 billion, in unlevered free cash flow and $6 plus free cash flow per share, as laid out earlier this year. We are also increasing our margin expectations, for normalized EBITDA to 24% to 25% for the full year, based on strong execution and disciplined investments. For Q3, we are targeting total revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.045 billion, representing growth of 8% at the midpoint. The adverse FX impact to the range assuming continuation of today's rates, would be approximately $10 million or 1% flowing through this impact, we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 13% and 15%, and core platform revenue to grow between 4% and 6%. For Q3, and full year bookings, we expect growth to be approximately two points below revenue primarily driven by FX pressure. We will continue investing in technology and development, to drive our robust product launch momentum, while balancing our goal for margin expansion through efficiencies in customer care and marketing. Normalized EBITDA for Q3, is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million, which would represent growth of 12% at the midpoint. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We fulfilled our $1 billion buyback target for 2022, and we'll continue to evaluate use of cash options for the remainder of the year, in line with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Lastly, as we said last quarter, we will evaluate the impact of rising interest rates and explore refinancing our term loan and revolver with the intention of maintaining our leverage ratio of two to four times. Before I close, I want to remind folks that during economic times like now, our strong balance sheet consistent cash flow and strength of execution, enable us to improve upon our market-leading position, through prudent investments and market share gains growing the business long term while also delivering on our profit and cash flow goals. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We enjoy exceptional retention, and we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, build deeper relationships and partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. We are laser focused on operational execution and we are dedicated to delivering 10% plus top line CAGR, 15% plus normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR through 2024. And with $1 billion of buybacks complete, halfway through the year, we remain committed to executing against the remaining $2 billion of shares, under our current authorization through 2024. With that, we will have Christie Masoner, from our Investor Relations team to open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. Two if I may. First, what drove the sequential uptick in gross margin? How much of an impact was FX on GM given that maybe a bit more of COGS there, such as like domain pass-through costs and infrastructure are incurred in dollars versus the revenue mix? And then second, on the price testing, Aman, I think you alluded to it. It looks like what we saw in our end both basic premium and Commerce plan saw increases mid-July ranging from like $1 to $3 a month, which translates to some pretty healthy increases on a percentage basis. Could you just clarify are these increases just for new customers versus existing subs? Is it domestic versus worldwide? And what do you expect the weighted average increase to be once this is fully rolled out?\nAman Bhutani: Mark, do you want to take the gross margin?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes, no problem. Hey, Trevor, how are you doing? So I would say, most of the gross margin mix was -- or change was based on product mix. The FX impact to that was pretty nominal.\nAman Bhutani: And then on pricing, yes, what you saw Trevor was us testing some changes and those were the price test for Websites + Marketing. In terms of taking that international, as I've shared before, the price testing for us is quite nuanced. We base it on geography, on sort of customer expectations, changing on market share. So you'll see it appear in certain geographies, but not in others.\nTrevor Young: That's really helpful. And just, Mark, just to clarify on the gross margin. If FX rates stay where they're at today, should we expect some impact on gross margin in the balance of the year from currency?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. So most of the impact on the FX affects our bookings, our costs are pretty much fixed and in line with the US dollar. So I would say, look for most of the FX impact to flow through to bookings and then ultimately lead to revenue with minimal impact on the cost in our structure today.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead and talk.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks, guts. Aman, you called out retention rates continue to remain strong. You did see some pressure from macro factors. Are there certain areas where you're seeing the macro impact your business more than others, maybe both on the product side as well as on geography?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Perhaps one thing to call out geographically is that, we see some greater pressure for European customers right now, given inflation or other macro factors. So that's something we're keeping an eye on. But, overall, we have continued to sort of focus our efforts to bring in customers that have high LTV, have great intent to build businesses to stay with us. So that's allowing us to stay with the high retention rates the 85% plus. So we're pretty happy with that overall.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And then, just a question on the marketing spend. You adjusted debt for demand, should we expect if macro improves and demand ramps back up that then we could see that go back up as a percentage of revenue, or how do you think about that adjusting that dial going forward?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. My broad view on marketing spend is that, we let it trail the demand and the signals we see and we look at both sort of external signals in terms of the Google universe and such, giving us data, but also our customers' data and what we're seeing in terms of return on marketing investment. So what you can expect is, if the demand spikes again, our marketing spend will follow, but we're also constantly improving the success-based metric for our marketing. So you'll see potentially some optimizations that continue to come. And we -- as an example, in Investor Day we shared some improvements in our SEM spend which was all based on improvement rather than just demand. So you'll see a mix of both. \nMark McCaffrey: And I'll add, we continue to expect to get leverage out of our marketing line, especially, as our business and our solutions are broader, as we get into more commerce as we get into more aftermarket. As once customers are into entrepreneur wheel, our efficiency and marketing gets better. So over time we expect to get leverage out of that marketing line and continue to be able to expand our normalized EBITDA margins based on that. \nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Many of the companies in the peer group around SMB have been calling out higher churn impact from macro. I'm just curious if you can kind of drill in and ultimately give us a sense of what is leaving you more immune to this and what's resonating some of the new product set? And then I had a quick follow-up. \nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Sure Brian. So let's start with the customer, right? GoDaddy's average customer is the micro business. A-third of our micro business customers are solopreneurs. We add to that the fact that the products we sell create tremendous value for our customers and the price we charge leaves plenty of consumer surplus for our customers right? So even if they have to adapt to changing economic environment the products we typically sell to them tend to be the last products they walk away from. So that's why we see sort of the continued high retention rates for customers. But also keep in mind, the more we have focused in terms of attracting the customer, to whom we can attach more and more products and reach higher LTV that sort of limits some of the \u2013 should I say, discounting and other techniques that companies might use to attract a lot of customers that may not have sort of good retention rates. But obviously, our strategy is to attract the customers that have high LTV have good retention rates.\nMark McCaffrey: And I'll just throw in there. The care relationship becomes extremely important in these times. And having that relationship and the person to go to, to help fix come up with more economic solutions to provide value seems to be and continue to be a winning formula and in these times even more important to that customer base.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And real quick, I think the Street unlevered free cash flow number is a little bit. Your number was a little bit below what the Street wanted. Was there anything to read into the number this quarter? I know, you're reiterating the long term but anything to comment there relative to the Street? \nMark McCaffrey: Nothing. We're really happy with our progress and we continue to work towards our annual goal. \nBrent Thill: Excellent. Thanks,.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead,\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much. Just as the entrepreneurs while let's get a little bit stretched with inflation and higher interest rates are you guys seeing any change in behavior or willingness to pay up for more expensive tiers or functionality across the portfolio? \nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Elizabeth. So, as you know, the higher premium tier offerings are especially in the case of Website + Marketing with the new Commerce Plus offering is relatively new for us right? And we're just super excited and announcing the launch of our WooSaaS solution, which is also going to be a premium offering. But all of these businesses are very new for us right? We have a base of 21 million customers. We have great relationships in Care. So we're sort of early in the process and not of course we realize that customers feel the pinch of inflation but these businesses are small for us in our core products they just deliver tremendous amounts of value. And one of the things we sometimes say here is people don't give up their dream because of an economic downturn. So they're not going to give up the domain name. \nElizabeth Porter: Got it. And then as a follow-up I was hoping if you could provide more color on what you're seeing in terms of those macro impacts on demand. I know Verisign reported a weaker outlook on domains, which raised some questions. And it sounds like churn is holding in pretty well. So just any incremental you could provide particularly on kind of the new customer demand would be really helpful. \nAman Bhutani: Yeah. We're definitely in a fluid demand environment and it's different by geography. I didn't make a small comment earlier about the European demand being weaker. But just to take a step back and look at the customer or the domains business overall if we look at GoDaddy's business it's very broad. Obviously, we sell 400 TLDs. We have a primary market. We have a secondary market the aftermarket business. In both cases, we are leaders in those businesses. We've invested in a corporate domains business. You saw us take on a registry business over the last couple of years and that's grown very well for us too. So when we look at our Domains business we feel it's a much broader business with many levers that obviously we use to continue to grow it compared to any one registry out there that may have one or a few TLDs. So that we think our business is quite different. \nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please our ahead.\nAaron Kessler: All right. Maybe just if you can talk a little bit about the ad environment just kind of hearing with ad pricing kind of coming down. Are you seeing kind of less competition and maybe getting some more efficiencies from a pricing coming down, whether it's Google Search or other areas? And then maybe just talk a little bit about the M&A environment just in terms of how you're seeing valuations get more attractive with obviously public equities coming down as well? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. On the sort of ad environment, it's always a competitive marketplace. I would never quite ever call that easy. But as we shared with you at Investor Day we continued to sort of push more success-based improve our abilities with bidding with machine learning to get better and better efficiencies. So, you do see some of that in our marketing leverage improvements. But overall I would just say the competitive dynamics are still the competitive dynamics. Obviously, in certain quarters, it's a bit easier than others, but overall, I wouldn't say there's some huge shift in it yet. And Mark on M&A.\nMark McCaffrey: On M&A our approach hasn't changed. We have our capital allocation strategy that we've talked about. We have our M&A strategy that we've talked about has to fit strategically has to work financially and has to be able to be integrated. We'll evaluate anything that comes along those lines. Obviously, we don't talk about anything active in any way shape or form. But we try to balance our decisions for today based on keeping an eye on our long-term objectives and we remain laser-focused on executing our objectives right now and we feel good about having a strong and solid year. \nAaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thanks Christie. Just a couple of questions quick ones on Payments and then on macro. On Payments you mentioned that 30% stat of WordPress customers using your Payments. I'm curious how you sort of move that number up and sort of what you see as sort of a trajectory over the next couple of years? And then in terms of the Apple Pay being added was that simply a cart conversion decision, or is there some potential pull in of new subscribers that potentially comes with that. And then on the macro, maybe just two sides of the coin. One those are centered around marketing, but how much of your marketing budget reduction is aligned to just lower absolute demand? And then on the flip side of that in terms of the success that you're seeing upselling products, what is the characteristic of that subscriber that is buying new product? Is it simply duration of a subscriber? Is there -- are there regional tier characteristics? Anything on that side of the coin would be interesting as well. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Sure. Thanks Mark. Let me take the Payments and Apple Pay piece and maybe and I can tag team on the other two items. So, on Payments GoDaddy Payments for Managed WordPress, we're super excited to move that number for 25% to 30%. You asked what are the types of things that we do. Customers actually have a choice of -- I think it's 140 options that they can choose from in WordPress. So, we're continually improving the experience for customers. So, it's easier and easier for them to make that choice for them to be able to differentiate between those choices and pick the best choice. And in that -- with those simplification and improvements, we see in this improvement to 30%. In terms of without commenting on sort of specific numbers that we'd be at in a couple of years, what I would say is we're very, very focused on simplifying the customer experience. We're very, very focused on delivering the one-stop shop to our customers whether they're selling in-store on their online store or on social media or the major marketplaces. So, giving that one subscription to our customers and letting them do everything they want to do from one place clearly is our objective. In terms of Apple Pay, so there are a couple of things there. There is the Apple Pay support and the Tap to Pay partnership. I think you're referencing the Tap to Pay partnership. And it's just super early. This just got announced by Apple, we'll happily share more with you as that sort of partnership develops. \nMark McCaffrey: And I'll start on the macro and the marketing budget. No doubt demand has been fluid in 2022, but overall it's been pretty solid. We look at marketing more as efficiency and optimization. We do look at things like Aman mentioned demand is down in Europe and we just accordingly. But where we continue to look at the ROI and optimize it based on not only our expanded product offerings, but how successful we are on the entrepreneurs wheel and our ability to attach. So, it's -- like I said, demand is definitely fluid, but the marketing is being efficient and optimized to make sure we're capturing the demand that makes sense. And then, I think there was a -- and I apologize there's a few questions in there. I think we had...\nMark Zgutowicz: Yeah. Sorry the other question was the other side of that coin in terms of the up-sell the success you're having up-selling products. Just curious, I guess the subscriber characteristics that are absorbing those products? Is it regional? Is it just the duration longer they're with you the more likely they're going to buy?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Sure. So the core funnel for us continues to be folks coming in to buy domains and attaching Email, attaching Websites, attaching Websites turning into attaching Commerce and we're laser focused on optimizing conversion through those funnels. We're also very, very focused on tracking the customer that has that intention, right? So if our marketing is intent focused and the conversion funnel is good, that's what allows us to attach more-and-more products. And of course we shared at Investor Day, a lot of good data in terms of penetration for emails for example with our 21 million customer base. We're also creating new products and bringing them to the market. The best example of that is Payable Domains, where you don't have to attach payments to a domain. You buy a domain, you get checkout page that you can customize that's enabled for your domain automatically. So you literally buy the domain and you can start taking payments, right? And that's a bit of a different movement, in that we're not selling the product and then attaching more, we're bundling it in right with the first purchase and literally putting -- and the idea there is put Commerce on every surface we have because that is in a sense the OmniCommerce ethos right, like wherever you're transacting, whatever surface you're creating your Commerce or your Micro Business is enabled in there.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Super helpful.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks, Christie. Two questions, one, international revenue growth I think is pretty consistently trailed out of your global growth. Is there anything there that you need to solve for to change that? And then secondly, Mark on share repurchases and you've repurchased what you said, you were going to do on trail or on track or even a little bit faster. So just thinking about it going forward you're generating a lot of free cash flow. What would cause you to even up that range? Like, what would you have to see that would make buying back the stock even more attractive than it's already been? I don't want to -- I'm not asking what more can you do for us, but I guess I am asking that a little bit. You obviously purchased back a lot of stock. You had the ability to purchase more. What would cause you to amp that up faster? Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: Aman, why don't you take the first part of that? And I'll take the second.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Mark. Yes, we're very happy with the international business. Over nine million of our 21 million customers are outside the U.S. and represent tremendous opportunity as we bring more and more products to that customer base outside the U.S. so, super bullish super happy with it. Some macro headwinds there, of course FX is there and we see some demand challenges too. But structurally, no concern with the international business, continue to be very happy with it, continue to allocate marketing dollars where we see the best return. And over the last two, three years I will say you've seen us move those dollars back and forth a bit. And that has some impact but no -- like super happy with it overall. And Mark for you.\nMark McCaffrey: And Mark thanks for pointing out we have a lot of free cash flow. Obviously that's a good thing in the especially in this day and age. We're really happy we've been able to execute on the $1 billion six months in. And we are continuing to balance our decisions today based on what our objectives are and driving long-term value. I'd say the best way to answer that question is, we have a very, disciplined capital allocation strategy. We will continue to look at use of cash. It's an active discussion between us and the Board. And right now okay we're authorized at $3 billion.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Okay, thank you, Mark. Thanks Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Maybe I just wanted to just -- can you talk about the price increase that you're testing? You said you're kind of discounting less. Is that sort of the way you're thinking about it? Are you also doing explicit price increases to your existing base of customers? How should we understand this from the outside looking in? And then I don't know if you touched on this already, I joined a little late but maybe just talk about demand trends and monthly -- in terms of just month-on-month, did you see any changes through the course of the quarter? How does July look like? Any color would be helpful.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. On the pricing, so I think there was a specific example for Websites + Marketing pricing in the earlier question. But let me pull it back, Naved, a little bit and talk about -- remember our pricing is nuanced not just by geographies or customer shifts with macro but also customer populations. So I think in the past you and I have talked about how for certain populations, for example, are the main investor customer, the pricing that we will have will be different from let's say a micro business customer. So we take a look at all of that. That's the testing that happens, right? Then when we find the best balance of that versus share depending on geography, depending on customer population you see us roll those out. And I think Mark can comment on it but those get built into our plan and into our forecast basically. So we're -- it's not a single event type thing. We have a large broad portfolio of products. So we're constantly evaluating and doing tests and seeing where we should take price. And typically we're taking price after we have added more value for the customer, right? We want to continue to push the willingness to pay up and then take price so that the surplus for the consumer continues to be maintained and the customer stay super happy with us. And then I think you had a question about -- the second part was around the overall demand trends. I did comment a little bit about Europe being a bit weaker. But overall month-to-month there are some small shifts depending on different businesses, but we're not seeing a tidal wave change in any way.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And Naved, I'll add on the pricing part of it, right? Anything we plan on doing on pricing has been included in our forecast. And we always keep in mind that 85% of our revenue comes from our existing 21 million customers. And we're very, very particular about making sure that the pricing we do is matched up the value we're providing with them and we see it in our retention rates staying at a stronger at higher than 85%.\nNaved Khan: Got it. Thank you both.\nChristie Masoner: That concludes our Q&A for this session. I'm going to turn the call over to Aman for closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you Christie. I'll just say thank you all for joining and a big thank you to all GoDaddy employees around the world for another solid quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. The best moments of my week are when I'm engaging with GoDaddy customers. I am constantly inspired by their grit and determination and amazed by their resilience. Just a couple of weeks ago, I spoke at a small business summit. I've met so many GoDaddy customers there and some who will hopefully become GoDaddy customers in the future. While they're worried about the current economic environment, I found them driven, ambitious, upbeat and passionate about their businesses. One customer walked up to me and started with my life is on GoDaddy. I am inspired to do more for her and all our customers to be better every day. Our relentless focus on innovation, deliver seamless and intuitive technology complemented by human care helping customers grow their businesses and achieve their dreams. Our strategy to attract high-value customers continue to show success best illustrated by our customer retention rates, which have remained greater than 85%. The Q2 results demonstrate our steady operating discipline, 9% growth in revenue and 30% growth in normalized EBITDA despite the challenging FX environment. GoDaddy's strong and diverse business enables us to navigate fluid global demand patterns and inflation concerns from a solid position and we are committed to attention and action on what we control. As in the past, we aligned our marketing spend and other investments with demand signals, concentrating on success-based, disciplined and efficient spending. We actively identify and deploy marketing spend where we find opportunities to deliver long-term growth. Through this plan we create balance across all components of our business without sacrificing our investment in technology and development for future growth. Our strategic priorities have been consistent over the past six quarters. First, driving Commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in Domains. Beginning with Commerce, we are pleased to share that we continue to achieve positive trajectory with our GoDaddy Payments offering and more specifically the attach rates to our other products. For Websites + Marketing, more than 80% of our Commerce customers choose our payment solution and for Managed WordPress, 30% of our Commerce customers choose our payment solution. Annualized GMV also continues to rise with Q2 at $28 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. We continue to drive strong sales in payment hardware devices enabling robust in-store capabilities for customers, while also steadily approving payment applications. While our payments offering is still relatively new, GoDaddy's differentiated OmniCommerce solution is well-positioned in this space. Regardless of the consumers' preferences whether they are shopping online or in person, our solutions empowers our customers to benefit from our industry-low transaction rates in all locations. We also rolled out Apple Pay on GoDaddy Payments improving the buying experience and Apple selected GoDaddy as a Tap to Pay partner. We are excited to work with Apple to bring Tap to Pay on iPhone to GoDaddy customers later this year. And as always we will share more information about this partnership as it becomes more meaningful. We embedded more capabilities within Websites plus Marketing plans to make it easier for entrepreneurs to market their products, sell online, manage their business and grow. New capabilities include product image enhancement, including background removal, quick view and buy capabilities enabling single-click add to cart, integrated discounting shipping labels, online appointment features making calendaring and appointments more intuitive. Enhancing our products helps our customers grow their business while building retention and creating greater lifetime value for GoDaddy. We also continue to test price increases for our highly competitive and feature-rich Websites plus Marketing product. Our approach to pricing is nuanced taking into consideration the right balance of increased price and market share while also closely monitoring shifts in customer behavior due to macro factors. We have limited the use of heavy discounting programs that frequent this space while maintaining our competitive position by offering products that our customers value. Our customer retention rates remain strong with consistent 15-month cohort retention, which is trending higher than prior year cohorts. And our overall customer retention metric has stayed above 85% even as we observe some pressure for customers due to macro factors. This is something we are extremely proud of because it is a sign that we continue to deliver for an often left behind customer the micro businesses that are the backbone of their local communities. We are proud that Websites plus Marketing delivers websites for customers that are highly performant. We have pushed the bar further on that and have implemented significant behind-the-scenes changes that result in improved website performance for millions of sites. These powerful improvements enable GoDaddy customers to achieve improved paid speed insights and Core Web Vitals scores. For example, our Core Web Vitals pass rate for our customers' sites increased by 75% making us the leader in this category. These improvements ensure GoDaddy's customers' websites rank higher in search results. And for small businesses this is extremely important. Moving on to GoDaddy Pros. This quarter we launched a beta WooSaaS solution to allow us to reach a larger customers those with sales of $1 million to a few million dollars. These larger customers will be able to sell anywhere including in-person on their online store and in online marketplaces and social platforms and benefit from omnichannel payment processing all managed in one place. This new online store offering provides growing merchants virtually infinite flexibility of WordPress plus WooCommerce combined with highly performing scalable and secure cloud hosting technology and a seamless intuitive and comprehensive software user experience. The fully managed technology stack allows our customers to focus on running their business. We brought together a team of experts in multiple technology domains to create this new premium offering which includes exclusive functionality with free premium extensions and exclusive capabilities such as an expert level dedicated support team. Our customers want a one-stop shop offering from us and WooSaaS solution is the latest proof point of GoDaddy's ability to move slightly up market over time. The beta program started in Q2 with an invite-only group of WooCommerce merchants and partners testing the integration and unification of multiple acquired technologies to offer a seamlessly managed all-in-one experience for WooCommerce stores. We are excited about the possibilities and looking forward to a full marketing launch. On our third priority, we are excited about the upcoming full launch of Payable Domains in Q3 a limited pilot program in Q2 focused on learnings demonstrated that customers value the offering. We also saw some green shoots in terms of meaningful GPV in the pilot being driven by customers without a website. In our Q3 launch, Payable Domains will be included for free and by default with every domain purchase creating a frictionless out-of-the-box experience for new businesses. We believe this will simplify the online payments process for our customers by giving them a professional branded checkout experience and the freedom to accept online payments without needing any other subscription. In closing, I want to acknowledge that while we are all in uncertain times GoDaddy's relentless focus on executing against our strategic priorities, delivering for our customers, building seamless and intuitive technology for our customers to succeed backed by human care, our scale and vast portfolio of offerings steadily drives GoDaddy's consistent financial results. Our incredible customers inspire us to continue to innovate and do even more for them. We will continue to be prudent stewards of capital investing behind long-term growth drivers and staying committed to delivering value to our customers, employees and shareholders. With that here's Mark. Mark, do you want to take the gross margin? And then on pricing, yes, what you saw Trevor was us testing some changes and those were the price test for Websites + Marketing. In terms of taking that international, as I've shared before, the price testing for us is quite nuanced. We base it on geography, on sort of customer expectations, changing on market share. So you'll see it appear in certain geographies, but not in others. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Perhaps one thing to call out geographically is that, we see some greater pressure for European customers right now, given inflation or other macro factors. So that's something we're keeping an eye on. But, overall, we have continued to sort of focus our efforts to bring in customers that have high LTV, have great intent to build businesses to stay with us. So that's allowing us to stay with the high retention rates the 85% plus. So we're pretty happy with that overall. Yes. My broad view on marketing spend is that, we let it trail the demand and the signals we see and we look at both sort of external signals in terms of the Google universe and such, giving us data, but also our customers' data and what we're seeing in terms of return on marketing investment. So what you can expect is, if the demand spikes again, our marketing spend will follow, but we're also constantly improving the success-based metric for our marketing. So you'll see potentially some optimizations that continue to come. And we -- as an example, in Investor Day we shared some improvements in our SEM spend which was all based on improvement rather than just demand. So you'll see a mix of both. Yeah. Sure Brian. So let's start with the customer, right? GoDaddy's average customer is the micro business. A-third of our micro business customers are solopreneurs. We add to that the fact that the products we sell create tremendous value for our customers and the price we charge leaves plenty of consumer surplus for our customers right? So even if they have to adapt to changing economic environment the products we typically sell to them tend to be the last products they walk away from. So that's why we see sort of the continued high retention rates for customers. But also keep in mind, the more we have focused in terms of attracting the customer, to whom we can attach more and more products and reach higher LTV that sort of limits some of the \u2013 should I say, discounting and other techniques that companies might use to attract a lot of customers that may not have sort of good retention rates. But obviously, our strategy is to attract the customers that have high LTV have good retention rates. Thank you. Thanks, Elizabeth. So, as you know, the higher premium tier offerings are especially in the case of Website + Marketing with the new Commerce Plus offering is relatively new for us right? And we're just super excited and announcing the launch of our WooSaaS solution, which is also going to be a premium offering. But all of these businesses are very new for us right? We have a base of 21 million customers. We have great relationships in Care. So we're sort of early in the process and not of course we realize that customers feel the pinch of inflation but these businesses are small for us in our core products they just deliver tremendous amounts of value. And one of the things we sometimes say here is people don't give up their dream because of an economic downturn. So they're not going to give up the domain name. Yeah. We're definitely in a fluid demand environment and it's different by geography. I didn't make a small comment earlier about the European demand being weaker. But just to take a step back and look at the customer or the domains business overall if we look at GoDaddy's business it's very broad. Obviously, we sell 400 TLDs. We have a primary market. We have a secondary market the aftermarket business. In both cases, we are leaders in those businesses. We've invested in a corporate domains business. You saw us take on a registry business over the last couple of years and that's grown very well for us too. So when we look at our Domains business we feel it's a much broader business with many levers that obviously we use to continue to grow it compared to any one registry out there that may have one or a few TLDs. So that we think our business is quite different. Thank you. Yes. On the sort of ad environment, it's always a competitive marketplace. I would never quite ever call that easy. But as we shared with you at Investor Day we continued to sort of push more success-based improve our abilities with bidding with machine learning to get better and better efficiencies. So, you do see some of that in our marketing leverage improvements. But overall I would just say the competitive dynamics are still the competitive dynamics. Obviously, in certain quarters, it's a bit easier than others, but overall, I wouldn't say there's some huge shift in it yet. And Mark on M&A. Sure. Thanks Mark. Let me take the Payments and Apple Pay piece and maybe and I can tag team on the other two items. So, on Payments GoDaddy Payments for Managed WordPress, we're super excited to move that number for 25% to 30%. You asked what are the types of things that we do. Customers actually have a choice of -- I think it's 140 options that they can choose from in WordPress. So, we're continually improving the experience for customers. So, it's easier and easier for them to make that choice for them to be able to differentiate between those choices and pick the best choice. And in that -- with those simplification and improvements, we see in this improvement to 30%. In terms of without commenting on sort of specific numbers that we'd be at in a couple of years, what I would say is we're very, very focused on simplifying the customer experience. We're very, very focused on delivering the one-stop shop to our customers whether they're selling in-store on their online store or on social media or the major marketplaces. So, giving that one subscription to our customers and letting them do everything they want to do from one place clearly is our objective. In terms of Apple Pay, so there are a couple of things there. There is the Apple Pay support and the Tap to Pay partnership. I think you're referencing the Tap to Pay partnership. And it's just super early. This just got announced by Apple, we'll happily share more with you as that sort of partnership develops. Yeah. Sure. So the core funnel for us continues to be folks coming in to buy domains and attaching Email, attaching Websites, attaching Websites turning into attaching Commerce and we're laser focused on optimizing conversion through those funnels. We're also very, very focused on tracking the customer that has that intention, right? So if our marketing is intent focused and the conversion funnel is good, that's what allows us to attach more-and-more products. And of course we shared at Investor Day, a lot of good data in terms of penetration for emails for example with our 21 million customer base. We're also creating new products and bringing them to the market. The best example of that is Payable Domains, where you don't have to attach payments to a domain.

Thank you. Thanks Mark. Yes, we're very happy with the international business. Over nine million of our 21 million customers are outside the U.S. and represent tremendous opportunity as we bring more and more products to that customer base outside the U.S. so, super bullish super happy with it. Some macro headwinds there, of course FX is there and we see some demand challenges too. But structurally, no concern with the international business, continue to be very happy with it, continue to allocate marketing dollars where we see the best return. And over the last two, three years I will say you've seen us move those dollars back and forth a bit. And that has some impact but no -- like super happy with it overall. And Mark for you. Thank you.

GoDaddy's resiliency and durable top line growth, profitability at scale and robust cash flow are evident in our Q2 financial results and enable GoDaddy to continue to invest to deliver long-term value while returning excess capital to investors in the form of share buybacks. Revenue in Q2 was $1 billion, growing 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the currency impact, our reported revenue would have come in at the high end of our Q2 guidance. Within total revenue international revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 15% within the target range of 14% to 16%, driven by continued strength in our Create and Grow products and Email attach. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 12% to more than $1.2 billion. And within that the ARR from our Create and Grow products grew 10% to $420 million. Additionally annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $28 billion, growing 12%. Core platform revenue grew 7% delivering at the high end of our 5% to 7% Q2 guidance, primarily due to strength in domain registration, aftermarket and security, offset by a slight decrease in our hosting business. ARR for our core platform grew 5% to $2.3 billion. Q2 bookings totaled $1.12 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 10% and core platform bookings grew 4% on similar growth factors noted for revenue. Normalized EBITDA grew 30% to $258 million. Our 25% margin represented over four points of margin expansion primarily because of expanded gross margins on product mix and reduced marketing spend. The decreased marketing spend is the result of disciplined moderation of our investment as we zero in on success-based marketing and flex our spending to capture attractive returns. Our technology and development expenses increased as a percent of revenue this quarter as we advanced our commerce and innovation strategies. Lastly, we recognized a $10 million impairment charge related to IT licenses and facilities as we continue to simplify our infrastructure. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $274 million. growing 16% driven by strong profitability. Additionally, year-to-date, we completed $1 billion of share buybacks, repurchasing 12.8 million shares and reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 8% since year-end. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.67 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year cash flow per share of $4.78, a 19% increase on strong cash flow and share repurchases. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $770 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt stands at $3.1 billion, at the midpoint of our targeted range of two to four times. Moving on to our outlook. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in the second half of 2022, and are on target to meet our full year operational and strategic goals, including our targets around normalized EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, and cash flow per share. With that said, we are not immune to the macro environment of the strengthening dollar and the impact that it has on our top line performance. Assuming a continuation of today's rates, over the rest of the year, we expect that the adverse FX impact for the full year to be approximately $35 million or approximately 1%, compared to our full year revenue guidance issued in February. As a result, we revised our 2022 full year revenue outlook to $4.1 billion to $4.13 billion. We remain focused on driving strong financial results, and are committed to delivering $1.1 billion, in unlevered free cash flow and $6 plus free cash flow per share, as laid out earlier this year. We are also increasing our margin expectations, for normalized EBITDA to 24% to 25% for the full year, based on strong execution and disciplined investments. For Q3, we are targeting total revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.045 billion, representing growth of 8% at the midpoint. The adverse FX impact to the range assuming continuation of today's rates, would be approximately $10 million or 1% flowing through this impact, we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 13% and 15%, and core platform revenue to grow between 4% and 6%. For Q3, and full year bookings, we expect growth to be approximately two points below revenue primarily driven by FX pressure. We will continue investing in technology and development, to drive our robust product launch momentum, while balancing our goal for margin expansion through efficiencies in customer care and marketing. Normalized EBITDA for Q3, is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million, which would represent growth of 12% at the midpoint. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We fulfilled our $1 billion buyback target for 2022, and we'll continue to evaluate use of cash options for the remainder of the year, in line with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Lastly, as we said last quarter, we will evaluate the impact of rising interest rates and explore refinancing our term loan and revolver with the intention of maintaining our leverage ratio of two to four times. Before I close, I want to remind folks that during economic times like now, our strong balance sheet consistent cash flow and strength of execution, enable us to improve upon our market-leading position, through prudent investments and market share gains growing the business long term while also delivering on our profit and cash flow goals. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We enjoy exceptional retention, and we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, build deeper relationships and partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. We are laser focused on operational execution and we are dedicated to delivering 10% plus top line CAGR, 15% plus normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR through 2024. And with $1 billion of buybacks complete, halfway through the year, we remain committed to executing against the remaining $2 billion of shares, under our current authorization through 2024. With that, we will have Christie Masoner, from our Investor Relations team to open up the call for questions. Yes, no problem. Hey, Trevor, how are you doing? So I would say, most of the gross margin mix was -- or change was based on product mix. The FX impact to that was pretty nominal. Yes. So most of the impact on the FX affects our bookings, our costs are pretty much fixed and in line with the US dollar. So I would say, look for most of the FX impact to flow through to bookings and then ultimately lead to revenue with minimal impact on the cost in our structure today. And I'll add, we continue to expect to get leverage out of our marketing line, especially, as our business and our solutions are broader, as we get into more commerce as we get into more aftermarket. As once customers are into entrepreneur wheel, our efficiency and marketing gets better. So over time we expect to get leverage out of that marketing line and continue to be able to expand our normalized EBITDA margins based on that. And I'll just throw in there. The care relationship becomes extremely important in these times. And having that relationship and the person to go to, to help fix come up with more economic solutions to provide value seems to be and continue to be a winning formula and in these times even more important to that customer base. Nothing. We're really happy with our progress and we continue to work towards our annual goal. On M&A our approach hasn't changed. We have our capital allocation strategy that we've talked about. We have our M&A strategy that we've talked about has to fit strategically has to work financially and has to be able to be integrated. We'll evaluate anything that comes along those lines. Obviously, we don't talk about anything active in any way shape or form. But we try to balance our decisions for today based on keeping an eye on our long-term objectives and we remain laser-focused on executing our objectives right now and we feel good about having a strong and solid year. And I'll start on the macro and the marketing budget. No doubt demand has been fluid in 2022, but overall it's been pretty solid. We look at marketing more as efficiency and optimization. We do look at things like Aman mentioned demand is down in Europe and we just accordingly. But where we continue to look at the ROI and optimize it based on not only our expanded product offerings, but how successful we are on the entrepreneurs wheel and our ability to attach. So, it's -- like I said, demand is definitely fluid, but the marketing is being efficient and optimized to make sure we're capturing the demand that makes sense. And then, I think there was a -- and I apologize there's a few questions in there. I think we had... Aman, why don't you take the first part of that? And I'll take the second. And Mark thanks for pointing out we have a lot of free cash flow. Obviously that's a good thing in the especially in this day and age. We're really happy we've been able to execute on the $1 billion six months in. And we are continuing to balance our decisions today based on what our objectives are and driving long-term value. I'd say the best way to answer that question is, we have a very, disciplined capital allocation strategy. We will continue to look at use of cash. It's an active discussion between us and the Board. And right now okay we're authorized at $3 billion. Yeah. And Naved, I'll add on the pricing part of it, right? Anything we plan on doing on pricing has been included in our forecast. And we always keep in mind that 85% of our revenue comes from our existing 21 million customers. And we're very, very particular about making sure that the pricing we do is matched up the value we're providing with them and we see it in our retention rates staying at a stronger at higher than 85%."

        "content": "Christie Masoner: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. On today's call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR gross merchandise volume or GMV and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations including our approach to capital allocation new product introductions and innovations and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today May 4, 2022 and except to the extent required by law we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that here's Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs everywhere, making opportunity inclusive for all. With the secular trends of entrepreneurship coupled with accelerating online presence and commerce, we believe GoDaddy's role is to help our micro and small business customers take advantage of the largest opportunity in front of them, the combination of the Internet and commerce. We do this by helping customers establish and maintain their digital identity. Our tools help customers extend their web presence to social media and marketplaces and into their in-store experience, giving them ubiquitous presence. And we are bringing them to the world of connected commerce by enabling every surface for them with commerce. This mission has never been more important and GoDaddy's combination of assets makes us a unique and differentiated player in the market. Together digital identity, ubiquitous presence and Connected Commerce form the entrepreneurs wheel, representing our customers' needs and how we meet and exceed them. We shared this new framing for GoDaddy at our Investor Day in February. We also presented a three-year plan and we are off to a good start. In the first quarter of 2022, revenue grew 11% year-over-year and normalized EBITDA grew faster, up 18% year-over-year. While we all face a fluid macro environment, we are focused on what we can control and delivering on expectations for our customers and shareholders. We are keeping a close eye on the war in Ukraine. The financial impacts of the war on our business are limited but we remain critically concerned for the safety of our contractors in the area. A prolonged war will likely mean a bigger disruption in the work and delays in some product releases and rollouts as we ramp resources in other areas. We are also closely monitoring the uneven demand patterns as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inflation and the strength of the US dollar is leading to FX headwinds across industries. Our business model is durable and offers us opportunities to adapt and be nimble. Our leadership team is focused on our three-year plan and mitigating short-term headwinds. Over the last several years, we have strengthened the quality of our revenue by delivering on our strategy to attract customers with higher lifetime value. Through disciplined execution, we have improved our renewal experience. And as a result, we have continued to drive modest improvements in our already high retention rates. An important data point that I am happy to share is that the 15-month renewal rate from the 2020 cohort of customers continues to be strong. Our commitment to our strategy is clearly highlighted in the consistency of our priorities. Our three strategic priorities have been and continue to be; first, driving Commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in Domains. We covered our priorities in detail at Investor Day so I will provide brief comments on each of these today. On our first priority, we have delivered many product launches in the last couple of months. But the one I want to highlight is the launch of a new higher-tier Commerce Plus plan. The new offering includes increased customer value in the form of simplified taxes unlimited product listings and higher limits on many features. From marketplace orders to e-mail campaigns, the data is early and encouraging. 80% of sales in this new tier are from new purchases. I'm looking across our Commerce plans 70% of customers are now choosing GoDaddy Payments up from the 60% we shared in February. Annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 20% year-over-year to $24 billion primarily driven by offline point of sale. For GoDaddy Pros, our focus continues to be to create best-in-class presence and commerce offerings and tooling for Managed WordPress. We continue to add more users to The Hub and our teams are working hard to increase rates of engagement. Our integration of Pagely continues at a good pace and we are excited about upcoming releases, which include a commerce offering and a new onboarding flow for Managed WordPress. I'm looking forward to sharing more about these new capabilities once they are launched. On innovation in Domains. In February, we shared that we are going to bring to market an innovative new product called Payable Domains. I am happy to share that we have started to test Payable Domains with a small percentage of customers in the US. It is too early to comment on how customers will receive and adopt this product, but we are eager to experiment with it as quickly as possible. In closing, I want to remind you that GoDaddy has built a durable business with a history of solid performance in all kinds of economic environment. By accelerating the rate of experimentation and innovation, we have continued to improve the quality of our products and enter new markets improving attach and ARPU and driving shareholder value. Our strength comes from our large customer base, extraordinary customer and revenue retention the power of our existing cohorts, the strong competitive advantages we have serving the micro and small business customer a clear three-year plan and a disciplined leadership team and workforce committed to our mission. With that here is Mark. \nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman and thank you everyone for joining us today. We are excited to share our strong Q1 results, which highlight our execution towards the targets we shared at our recent Investor Day. Our results demonstrate our focus on delivering a balanced combination of durable topline growth, profitability at scale, and robust cash flow and our performance shows GoDaddy's business resiliency. We are pleased that we were able to deliver a strong first quarter, while we actively manage through the uncertain global macro environment. In Q1, total revenue grew to $1 billion, which represents 12% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis and 11% year-over-year on a reported basis. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As shared earlier this year, we updated the lens by which we report the pillars of our revenue. This change transitioned our reporting from three revenue segments into two new segments; Applications and Commerce and Core Platform. This gives us the framework of how we will talk about our business and opportunities going forward. Applications and Commerce revenue, which includes presence in application solutions, grew 16% year-over-year. Coming in at the high end of our guidance range from February, our presence products such as Websites + Marketing contributed to this growth. And as Aman mentioned earlier, we drove great traction with the attach of our payment solution which will show up in this line item as it becomes more meaningful. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. ARR from our Create and Grow group of products which includes Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite, and GoDaddy Studio grew 13% year-over-year to $410 million. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $24 billion, growing 20% year-over-year. We achieved growth across all channels, primarily driven by off-line point-of-sale. Core Platform revenue which includes Domains, Hosting, and Security products grew 9% year-over-year, delivering above our February guide with 40% of the increase driven by aftermarket. ARR for Core Platform grew 5% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As a reminder, aftermarket performance does not impact ARR. Q1 bookings were $1.16 billion growing over 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a reported basis against tough comparisons from the strong year ago quarter. Additionally, Q1 bookings grew 10% sequentially against our largest ever Q4 quarter. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 9% year-over-year and Core Platform bookings grew 5% year-over-year. Normalized EBITDA grew 18% year-over-year to $226 million at a 23% margin, representing over a point of margin expansion compared to the same period last year and bringing our normalized EBITDA margins within the 23% to 24% guide we outlined at Investor Day. Our technology and development expenses increased as a percent of revenue this quarter as we focused on building our commerce and innovation strategies. Additionally, as we continued reopening offices in Q1 our G&A expenses also increased as a percentage of revenue while remaining below historical levels. We drove leverage in our marketing spend, based on continued execution of the formula outlined at Investor Day. Additionally, during Q1, we faced inflation pressures primarily in the form of increasing energy and cloud infrastructure expenses.  Currently, we have medium-term contracts and FX hedges to mitigate some of the foreseen impacts. We expect these inflation-related impacts to continue throughout 2022 and we will monitor and proactively address our exposure in these areas. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $287 million, growing 7% year-over-year driven by strong profitability. Additionally, during the quarter we began executing against our announced $3 billion authorized share repurchase through an initial $750 million accelerated share repurchase or ASR expected to be completed in May. Through Q1, we repurchased an initial 6.5 million shares reducing our total share count by 4% since year-end bringing our free cash flow per share, to $5.25 on a trailing 12-month basis versus prior year cash flow per share of $4.51 for an increase of 16%. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $743 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.3 billion. Net debt stands at $3.2 billion at the midpoint of our targeted range of two to four times. Moving on to our outlook. Given the solid start to our year and the predictability of our model, based on what we know now, we are comfortable with our full year 2022 outlook provided in February. Having said that we are not immune to the current macroeconomic environment, which increases our short-term exposure to foreign currency and customer demand fluctuations. While the environment remains fluid, we believe our predictable model allows us the flexibility to moderate our investments and leverage our operating expenses to seek to offset exposure to revenue from these factors. We also remain committed to delivering the $6-plus free cash flow per share discussed in February. For Q2, we are targeting total revenue in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. Within that we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 14% and 16% and Core Platform revenue to grow between 5% and 7%. For Q2, and full year bookings we expect growth to be approximately two points below revenue, primarily driven by FX pressure. We will continue investing in technology and development to drive our robust product launch momentum while balancing our goal for margin expansion through efficiencies in customer care and marketing. Normalized EBITDA for Q2, is expected to be in the range of $232 million to $237 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint. Our capital allocation strategy also remains unchanged. During the second and third quarter, we intend to fulfill our $1 billion buyback target for 2022 through an additional $250 million of share repurchases. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of rising interest rates and explore refinancing our term loan and revolver, with the intention of maintaining our leverage ratio of 2 to 4 times. Before I close, I want to reiterate that we remain laser-focused on execution and we have a track record of consistency in difficult times. We are marching towards delivering the 10% top line CAGR, 15% normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR, while buying back $3 billion of our stock over the next three years, that we described in detail in our Investor Day. We are balancing our near-term and long-term goals, emphasizing, delivering strong results, while at the same time investing in areas for future growth. GoDaddy leads in providing small business solutions, a position that we built by understanding the needs of our more than 21 million customers. While the current macro events present challenges, GoDaddy's resiliency comes from our long history of strong customer retention, the power of our existing cohorts and the competitive advantages we built as the champion for small businesses. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. \nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. Two if I may. Just first one any color on how customer growth has trended thus far in 2022 relative to the 3% growth last year? Aman, I think you made some comments about on a 15-month basis, the 2020 cohort is retaining at pretty healthy levels. I'm just trying to get a sense, kind of, like in-period demand from new customers. Have you seen any improvement in that cadence? And then, on international, revs declining a tad Q-on-Q. Were there any specific regions or countries where you saw weakness in the quarter? And did you see weakness specifically in Europe following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Trevor. This is Aman. On the 15-month retention rates one of the reasons I wanted to share that metric is, 2020 was a huge cohort for the company. And I think analysts have been asking us, investors have been asking us about retention rates on it. And we're very excited to see that we've continued to attract a customer with a high LTV, a customer that wants to stay with us. So those strong retention rates were obviously very, very important for us. And in terms of the customer growth, we don't guide to customer growth. But definitely at the end of the year, it will be something we'll be happy to talk about more and share with you. In terms of international, I'm sure Mark may mention a thing or two, but generally, I would say, we see the same sort of macro environment that you see in Europe as an example. In Russia we did shutdown our Russia website and removed support for the ruble. And that had an impact. And maybe, Mark, you want to comment on it. I wouldn't call it any sort of material impact. But perhaps, Mark, you want to comment on it? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Aman, and Trevor. I think that's exactly right, Aman. I think you stole the buy line. We did shut down. It didn't have a significant impact on us. I would say, it's more of the macroeconomic trends that are impacting us throughout Europe, and there isn't a particular exposure to any region or country at this point to call out.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thank you, both.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe addressing the previous question in a different way on a product level, just wanted some qualitative thoughts on the macro impacts to Domain demand, and if there was any characterization you could offer between North America demand and international demand for Domains? And then, I think as a follow-up to that. With a 40% increase driven by aftermarket, was that in line with your expectations or above? And as we settle into kind of cleaner compares, where do you think the growth contribution from aftermarket goes?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Thanks, Clarke. I can take the first, and Mark perhaps you can take the second. In terms of domain demand, Clarke, I would point to the sort of core domain business for us, which is now much more than selling just specific TLDs. We sell a large sort of set of TLDs across the world. We've also added to that capability the secondary market. We then combine the primary market in the secondary market. We connected those really well. You will remember products like list for sale from a year, about a year and a half ago. And then, we've also added Corporate business in Domains and we've added more recently a Registry business as well. So we continue to be very happy with our overall Domains business. But it's really the collection of sort of diverse products that we have that are performing really well for us. And then, on the aftermarket, maybe Mark I can turn it to you.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Clarke. Hey listen, we couldn't be more happier than the momentum we have in the aftermarket. And I think we've talked about it coming out of Q4. And we continue to see strong volume growth and average prices going up. And that's what we really track when we look at the momentum around there. It's hard to predict the larger transactions but we still see them coming in. And we still see the momentum obviously quarter-over-quarter that created within that market. Nothing to call out domestic versus -- or sorry, North America versus international. It seems to be just broad-based momentum in that market and we continue to be pleased with the amount of transactions and the volume that is going through there right now.\nClarke Jeffries: Good. And if I could squeeze one more in about just how the investment plan changes given the macro environment. Just trying to get a sense of whether you see it as a net benefit to profitability or whether there will be some offsetting costs you do have to rotate some of that kind of contractor headcount around. Is it kind of a net benefit or a net headwind to profitability as you look through the year?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. I think -- and if you're specifically talking about sort of my comments around the contractors in the Ukraine region. It is an important but a small group of people for us. So given our sort of large base of engineers across the world and our ability to hire globally and work with vendors around the world, we think overall it's not a huge shift. It is an important group of people. Their safety is of paramount importance to us but I wouldn't overfocus on it because the size of the group is small.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Clarke, I'll just add on to that. The cost is -- we don't look at it as a headwind.\nClarke Jeffries: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I'll take the macro one again. Maybe like a kind of two-sided. So, one of the things we're seeing around is just a lot of pressure on e-commerce. I mean it sounded like from your comments in-store POS has been a big driver of strength in GMV images. Talk about the puts and takes on offline and online commerce that you're seeing. And then, when we have -- when we start to talk about recession, ultimately the impact to SMEs who are usually typically more exposed comes up a lot. So anything you're hearing from your SME customers? I know you're seeing things like improvements in renewals and things look pretty good but just the tone from your customers anything you're hearing there.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Ygal. Look on bringing online and offline commerce together, what we call Connected Commerce is more important for our customers than ever before, right? They need to be able to quickly pivot to selling online or be able to bring those same capabilities in-store very, very quickly. Given our portfolio and given that we are still very early in the Connected Commerce space and the exposure we have to sort of GMV is generally small in our overall business, we're still growing in that area. We have lots of opportunity where I feel very, very early in that field. And in terms of different economic impacts. I would point you to a data point I think we shared a couple of years ago. When we looked at the data or the cohort for 2008, you might remember we talked about the recession, the Great Recession cohort. Well that cohort a couple of years ago had delivered $1.5 billion in revenue with GoDaddy. And today it is up to $1.9 billion in terms of what that cohort has delivered in terms of revenue. So we look at that cohort and we see it perform very similar to other cohorts. So we look at our business and we say look, we deliver a set of products at a price that delivered great value to our customers. This is essential to their future to their growth. And yes in the short term things might move up and down a bit but those cohorts over time continue to perform very, very well. And maybe I'll turn it to you to add a couple of more bits to that.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes, and that's great. I think in these times what we're hearing is that being a one-stop shop for our customer base, which is entrepreneurs and very small businesses becomes an opportunity. They are focusing on their business and their ability to really count on us to help make their go-to-market easier seems to be something that is resonating with them. And a reminder, we generate about 85% of our revenue coming from our existing 21 million customers. So our ability to give them relevant products in the market is just a huge upside for us and we look at it as very much a positive going forward.\nYgal Arounian: That's really helpful. And maybe if you could just talk about Commerce Plus a little bit and expand on that. It sounds \u2013 seems like a really interesting product. Is that you guys going a little bit more upmarket, or is that still a product that's more focused on your kind of micro SMB core customer? And anything you could share about price points and any other details around that will be super helpful. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Sure, Ygal. In terms of the target customer like we shared on Investor Day, we have lots of customers in our base that sell up to $1 million or do up to $1 million of GMV a year. And as we had shared with you we want to be able to serve their needs because they are our customers already and we don't need to do that much more to serve them well. And we have talked about launching in Q1, a new higher-end SKU. That's what the Commerce Plus SKU is. Happy to send you details offline in terms of price points and how far it's launched and stuff like that. But you can literally go to the US website and see it. You will see 100% of the time. So it's absolutely there available to customers. And we're very excited about it like 80% of the sales that we have seen and have seen in that SKU have been new purchases, which means customers are willing to pay more for the greater value that we provided them. And it's definitely played a little bit of a part as well in the overall customers adopting GoDaddy Payments because now 70% of customers in our Commerce SKUs are adopting GoDaddy Payments, which was 60% in February that we shared with you.\nYgal Arounian: Great. Thanks so much. Let me check that out on the site.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark, please go ahead. Mark, I believe you are muted.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thanks for that. I just wanted to draft maybe on the couple of those last questions. On the new customer side of Commerce Plus which you highlighted, I'm just curious if you could maybe refresh us again on your go-to-market and sort of where perhaps those new customers are coming from. And then, as it relates to your GMV growth, obviously you noted mainly coming from POS. So just trying to get a sense of sustainability of that 20% growth and if that sort of corresponds to the CAGR that you're sort of talking about for Applications and Commerce three-year CAGR and sort of the high teens. If that would sort of parallel that growth. That's it for me. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Mark. On the new Commerce Plus plan in terms of go-to-market approach, it's super new product. We just launched it this last quarter. And most of the customer base is coming in through the web. So that's where we've done majority of the testing. No doubt, we have a huge competitive advantage in the Care organization and the ability of the Care organization to be able to have a fantastic relationship with our customers and to be able to upsell customers. But that is part of this year's priority for us to be able to get our go-to-market motion really swinging in terms of Commerce. But we're excited to have the product launch. We're excited to have customers like it we're excited that we can go to GoDaddy Payments. So that's been fantastic for us. In terms of GMV growth we just feel we're so early in the payment space and we have such a large customer base with this need. Of course, it's hard to sort of have a crystal ball and talk about specifics in terms of numbers of the long term. But we feel we're very, very early and there's just so much more for us to take. It's a massive TAM. We're positioned really well. We're putting out great innovative products in the market in terms of what we're doing with websites plus marketing. In my prepared comments, I mentioned a new commerce coming for WordPress. We have payable domains out there now testing in the US. So, we're really lighting up all our services with Commerce. So we feel we're just earlier.\nMark Zgutowicz: Super. Well, thanks very much. I appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead.\nAaron Kessler: Great. Can you hear me? Maybe just -- I know you've been working on the cloud transition for a couple of years. Now can you just talk about where you are on that? And then any impact that you're seeing from overall labor costs obviously a question coming up on a lot of our conference calls as well? And then finally, just in terms of the lower year-over-year marketing spend. Nice leverage there. I guess, how much of an impact is that having on kind of gross adds or customer adds for that lower marketing spend, or have you been able to find more efficient sources? I think you mentioned that at the Investor Day as well? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Aaron. Let me take the cloud and marketing and Mark maybe you can comment on the labor costs. In terms of our transition to cloud, we continue to be very happy with our applications moving to the cloud. We're seeing higher productivity, we're seeing better responsiveness. We measure our applications with the Google tools and they performed very, very well, both sort of in the US and globally. So we're very excited about that. The transition is going to plan nothing significant to call out there. In terms of our marketing dollars, I think over the last year, we've been very open about sharing with you our philosophy around marketing, while making sure that we lean into the demand when we see it. And then as we see sort of changes in the mat pattern that we manage our marketing dollars. We don't want to manage them too aggressively because we don't want to pull demand down just for GoDaddy but we do want to follow the demand patterns. And what we are doing is that we're coupling that with investments in data science and better data and better technology that's allowing us to make a \u2013 measure that marketing spend better and better every year and be more efficient with it. And Mark I'll turn it to you for the labor cost comment. \nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And thanks Aaron. On labor costs we have been in a hypercompetitive environment for talent here for a number of years. So we've been constantly looking at how do we attract talent but yet have levers in place to moderate the cost buildup appropriately. And that hasn't changed, and we're not seeing anything that would cause us to think that that's going to be what we haven't built into our guide already. And we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the locations of our employees going forward to make sure we can maintain that into our three-year outlook. \nAaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth. Please go ahead. Elizabeth, please un-mute.\nElizabeth Porter: Hi. Thank you so much. I have a question on the competitive landscape. So back in March Google announced that they were going GA with their Domains product after being in beta for multiple years. So I just wanted to get your view on the \u2013 any changes to the competitive landscape? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Elizabeth. Specific to Google, we've been competing with Google on Domains for I think seven years or more. And the removal of sort of the beta logo if you will it doesn't change \u2013 sort of create any fundamental change in the industry from my view. Competing with the mega tech players is a fact of life for every tech business. So I feel we've been competing with them and sort of not much has changed with this little change from them. \nElizabeth Porter: Great. And then on the payment side, great to see that adoption kind of ticked up to 70% from 60%. And I believe that's just new customers that are going into Commerce. So I wanted to see, if there had been any change in legacy customers kind of moving over to GoDaddy Payments from their prior provider just given the competitive kind of pricing that you guys offer with that product. \nAman Bhutani: Yeah. I think majority of what we've talked about is new customers going through the site. In terms of our legacy customers, we continue to feel that is a big opportunity for GoDaddy. Anecdotally, we do see a set of customers that are attractive. So we know that our pricing makes sense. We know that, this is something we can scale. But that's part of this year's priority for us to get the go-to-market motions at scale across the company, so that we can go after not just the new but the legacy customers as well. But it's just \u2013 that is still work in progress. \nElizabeth Porter: Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yep. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, good afternoon. I guess a couple, on financially the bookings growth trailed revenue this quarter. I guess, was that more just a comp, or was there anything on the internal execution that you call out that caused that? \nMark McCaffrey: I'll jump into that one Aman. You can add color. You hit it right on the head there. It's \u2013 we're comping to a tough quarter last year. We did talk about January at Investor Day and some of the impacts in the market and we've seen positive momentum coming out of the quarter which gives us a lot of comfort as we get into the rest of the year. We're excited about it. So there's nothing in particular to call out that we haven't already mentioned. And we also are very happy that coming off a great Q4. The bookings growth was pretty strong. So we like the momentum, we like the opportunities out there in the market right now. Obviously, it's an interesting time, but we continue to manage through it and we feel good about where we think we're going to end up for the year and the quarter Q2. \nBrent Thill: And maybe just a quick follow-up that obviously the elephant in the room was watching is the interest rates and what that does to the small business segment. And I'm curious how you're thinking about this and what happens not maybe this quarter, next quarter but over the next year? How do you think you can kind of be more insulated or not? Curious how you think through this as that rolls through? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Brent, I'll take it on two ends on that one. One, us internally and then two customer demand. And Aman may have some comments on the customer end of it. One on our end we're -- I think it's in our prepared remarks or slide we're about 13% variable interest rate right now. So we think the impact for us in the quarter and the year will be minimal. Obviously, we will as we mentioned we look to refinance our term loan and our revolver. And if it makes sense we'll do so. But we think those are the things within our control. When it comes to our customer base it's hard to predict the overall impact of inflation, but we believe because our products help them do business and our ability to be a one-stop shop helps them ultimately be more efficient in the marketplace and focus on growing their business that we are an additive tool for them versus something they will have to choose between. But it's hard to look at the overall impact on the three years. And Aman I don't know if you want to add to that at all. \nAman Bhutani: Maybe just to say Brent appreciate the long-term view on the question. My view is that we have the secular trends around entrepreneurship around the Internet around commerce on the Internet. We're positioned really well. This is a critical need for micro and small businesses. So the TAM is large. GoDaddy's positioning is very, very good. It's mission-critical to customers. They don't -- in a difficult time customers don't give up their website or they don't give up their domain anymore. Lots of them don't do that. So from my perspective if times are tough for our customers that's actually opportunity for GoDaddy to do more for them. That's the opportunity to GoDaddy has to help them understand how they can navigate those times better. And as I shared about sort of the 2008 cohort we can end up with fantastic customers in all kinds of economic environments. \nBrent Thill: Thank you. \nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Rajgopal from Berenberg. Sunil, please go ahead.\nSunil Rajgopal: Hi. Can you please comment about the overhead expenses line seems to have gone up quite a bit this quarter? And also my second question will be on the Payments front. Just want to understand a little bit more I know you commented earlier about that you are still in the early phase of deployment in terms of the payment opportunity. But have you thought about what would be the potential opportunity from our payable Domains and how that could potentially accelerate your revenue stream going forward? Thank you. \nMark McCaffrey : I'll hit the first part of that and Aman maybe you can handle the second. And Sunil, I assume you're talking about the G&A line when you say overhead.\nSunil Rajgopal : Right. \nMark McCaffrey : It represents -- we started reopening our offices in Q1, so saw a small uptick as we got ready for that. It's still below historical levels and we expect it to be in one going forward and we're comfortable with where we are in our normalized EBITDA margins that we put out there in the guide and also for our three-year plan. But the specific increase was related to opening the offices in Q1. \nAman Bhutani : And Sunil, on payable domains, I think, my excitement about that product sort of leaked out during Investor Day. I'm sure you will notice how excited I get about it. My view is it's a fundamentally new idea. Nobody else is selling that product. We have tremendous scale to bring that to market. But we have to work with customers to understand -- to help them understand what the new product is. And that's what we're going through. That's what we're testing. We have great estimates on what we think it can be. That's definitely why we're talking about it and we're excited about it. And we'll keep you informed on how it progresses. You'll be able to see it on the side. You'll be able to see us doing more and more with it.\nSunil Rajgopal : Sure. Thank you. And maybe if I could just follow-up. You talked about inflationary pressures in terms of the cloud infrastructure costs going up. So how should we be thinking about those costs? And is there, I mean, do you think it will incrementally pose pressure on margin, I mean, pushing the margins towards the low end of the guidance?\nMark McCaffrey : So when we look at the infrastructure cloud costs, we're still in the process of moving to the cloud. I think we've talked about that and our impact on our tech and dev line. And we still look at it as an opportunity to moderate our cost as well as reduce our capital expenditures going forward. Everything that we are looking at today we've included in the guide not only for the year, but for our three-year plan. And we feel comfortable with our normalized EBITDA margins where they are. Obviously, lots of puts and takes. But we're comfortable where we are and built in what we can see today. \nSunil Rajgopal : Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: As a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask the question, please use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the webinar screen. Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Naved, I think you are on mute. I will turn the call back over to Aman for closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani : Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll end the call by just thanking all the GoDaddy team members who have been doing a tremendous job getting out these results and all the good work we do for our customers as well. And may the fourth be with you.",

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Christie and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs everywhere, making opportunity inclusive for all. With the secular trends of entrepreneurship coupled with accelerating online presence and commerce, we believe GoDaddy's role is to help our micro and small business customers take advantage of the largest opportunity in front of them, the combination of the Internet and commerce. We do this by helping customers establish and maintain their digital identity. Our tools help customers extend their web presence to social media and marketplaces and into their in-store experience, giving them ubiquitous presence. And we are bringing them to the world of connected commerce by enabling every surface for them with commerce. This mission has never been more important and GoDaddy's combination of assets makes us a unique and differentiated player in the market. Together digital identity, ubiquitous presence and Connected Commerce form the entrepreneurs wheel, representing our customers' needs and how we meet and exceed them. We shared this new framing for GoDaddy at our Investor Day in February. We also presented a three-year plan and we are off to a good start. In the first quarter of 2022, revenue grew 11% year-over-year and normalized EBITDA grew faster, up 18% year-over-year. While we all face a fluid macro environment, we are focused on what we can control and delivering on expectations for our customers and shareholders. We are keeping a close eye on the war in Ukraine. The financial impacts of the war on our business are limited but we remain critically concerned for the safety of our contractors in the area. A prolonged war will likely mean a bigger disruption in the work and delays in some product releases and rollouts as we ramp resources in other areas. We are also closely monitoring the uneven demand patterns as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inflation and the strength of the US dollar is leading to FX headwinds across industries. Our business model is durable and offers us opportunities to adapt and be nimble. Our leadership team is focused on our three-year plan and mitigating short-term headwinds. Over the last several years, we have strengthened the quality of our revenue by delivering on our strategy to attract customers with higher lifetime value. Through disciplined execution, we have improved our renewal experience. And as a result, we have continued to drive modest improvements in our already high retention rates. An important data point that I am happy to share is that the 15-month renewal rate from the 2020 cohort of customers continues to be strong. Our commitment to our strategy is clearly highlighted in the consistency of our priorities. Our three strategic priorities have been and continue to be; first, driving Commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in Domains. We covered our priorities in detail at Investor Day so I will provide brief comments on each of these today. On our first priority, we have delivered many product launches in the last couple of months. But the one I want to highlight is the launch of a new higher-tier Commerce Plus plan. The new offering includes increased customer value in the form of simplified taxes unlimited product listings and higher limits on many features. From marketplace orders to e-mail campaigns, the data is early and encouraging. 80% of sales in this new tier are from new purchases. I'm looking across our Commerce plans 70% of customers are now choosing GoDaddy Payments up from the 60% we shared in February. Annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 20% year-over-year to $24 billion primarily driven by offline point of sale. For GoDaddy Pros, our focus continues to be to create best-in-class presence and commerce offerings and tooling for Managed WordPress. We continue to add more users to The Hub and our teams are working hard to increase rates of engagement. Our integration of Pagely continues at a good pace and we are excited about upcoming releases, which include a commerce offering and a new onboarding flow for Managed WordPress. I'm looking forward to sharing more about these new capabilities once they are launched. On innovation in Domains. In February, we shared that we are going to bring to market an innovative new product called Payable Domains. I am happy to share that we have started to test Payable Domains with a small percentage of customers in the US. It is too early to comment on how customers will receive and adopt this product, but we are eager to experiment with it as quickly as possible. In closing, I want to remind you that GoDaddy has built a durable business with a history of solid performance in all kinds of economic environment. By accelerating the rate of experimentation and innovation, we have continued to improve the quality of our products and enter new markets improving attach and ARPU and driving shareholder value. Our strength comes from our large customer base, extraordinary customer and revenue retention the power of our existing cohorts, the strong competitive advantages we have serving the micro and small business customer a clear three-year plan and a disciplined leadership team and workforce committed to our mission. With that here is Mark. Thanks, Trevor. This is Aman. On the 15-month retention rates one of the reasons I wanted to share that metric is, 2020 was a huge cohort for the company. And I think analysts have been asking us, investors have been asking us about retention rates on it. And we're very excited to see that we've continued to attract a customer with a high LTV, a customer that wants to stay with us. So those strong retention rates were obviously very, very important for us. And in terms of the customer growth, we don't guide to customer growth. But definitely at the end of the year, it will be something we'll be happy to talk about more and share with you. In terms of international, I'm sure Mark may mention a thing or two, but generally, I would say, we see the same sort of macro environment that you see in Europe as an example. In Russia we did shutdown our Russia website and removed support for the ruble. And that had an impact. And maybe, Mark, you want to comment on it. I wouldn't call it any sort of material impact. But perhaps, Mark, you want to comment on it? Yeah. Thanks, Clarke. I can take the first, and Mark perhaps you can take the second. In terms of domain demand, Clarke, I would point to the sort of core domain business for us, which is now much more than selling just specific TLDs. We sell a large sort of set of TLDs across the world. We've also added to that capability the secondary market. We then combine the primary market in the secondary market. We connected those really well. You will remember products like list for sale from a year, about a year and a half ago. And then, we've also added Corporate business in Domains and we've added more recently a Registry business as well. So we continue to be very happy with our overall Domains business. But it's really the collection of sort of diverse products that we have that are performing really well for us. And then, on the aftermarket, maybe Mark I can turn it to you. Yeah. I think -- and if you're specifically talking about sort of my comments around the contractors in the Ukraine region. It is an important but a small group of people for us. So given our sort of large base of engineers across the world and our ability to hire globally and work with vendors around the world, we think overall it's not a huge shift. It is an important group of people. Their safety is of paramount importance to us but I wouldn't overfocus on it because the size of the group is small. Thanks, Ygal. Look on bringing online and offline commerce together, what we call Connected Commerce is more important for our customers than ever before, right? They need to be able to quickly pivot to selling online or be able to bring those same capabilities in-store very, very quickly. Given our portfolio and given that we are still very early in the Connected Commerce space and the exposure we have to sort of GMV is generally small in our overall business, we're still growing in that area. We have lots of opportunity where I feel very, very early in that field. And in terms of different economic impacts. I would point you to a data point I think we shared a couple of years ago. When we looked at the data or the cohort for 2008, you might remember we talked about the recession, the Great Recession cohort. Well that cohort a couple of years ago had delivered $1.5 billion in revenue with GoDaddy. And today it is up to $1.9 billion in terms of what that cohort has delivered in terms of revenue. So we look at that cohort and we see it perform very similar to other cohorts. So we look at our business and we say look, we deliver a set of products at a price that delivered great value to our customers. This is essential to their future to their growth. And yes in the short term things might move up and down a bit but those cohorts over time continue to perform very, very well. And maybe I'll turn it to you to add a couple of more bits to that. Sure, Ygal. In terms of the target customer like we shared on Investor Day, we have lots of customers in our base that sell up to $1 million or do up to $1 million of GMV a year. And as we had shared with you we want to be able to serve their needs because they are our customers already and we don't need to do that much more to serve them well. And we have talked about launching in Q1, a new higher-end SKU. That's what the Commerce Plus SKU is. Happy to send you details offline in terms of price points and how far it's launched and stuff like that. But you can literally go to the US website and see it. You will see 100% of the time. So it's absolutely there available to customers. And we're very excited about it like 80% of the sales that we have seen and have seen in that SKU have been new purchases, which means customers are willing to pay more for the greater value that we provided them. And it's definitely played a little bit of a part as well in the overall customers adopting GoDaddy Payments because now 70% of customers in our Commerce SKUs are adopting GoDaddy Payments, which was 60% in February that we shared with you. Thank you. Thanks, Mark. On the new Commerce Plus plan in terms of go-to-market approach, it's super new product. We just launched it this last quarter. And most of the customer base is coming in through the web. So that's where we've done majority of the testing. No doubt, we have a huge competitive advantage in the Care organization and the ability of the Care organization to be able to have a fantastic relationship with our customers and to be able to upsell customers. But that is part of this year's priority for us to be able to get our go-to-market motion really swinging in terms of Commerce. But we're excited to have the product launch. We're excited to have customers like it we're excited that we can go to GoDaddy Payments. So that's been fantastic for us. In terms of GMV growth we just feel we're so early in the payment space and we have such a large customer base with this need. Of course, it's hard to sort of have a crystal ball and talk about specifics in terms of numbers of the long term. But we feel we're very, very early and there's just so much more for us to take. It's a massive TAM. We're positioned really well. We're putting out great innovative products in the market in terms of what we're doing with websites plus marketing. In my prepared comments, I mentioned a new commerce coming for WordPress. We have payable domains out there now testing in the US. So, we're really lighting up all our services with Commerce. So we feel we're just earlier. Yes. Thanks, Aaron. Let me take the cloud and marketing and Mark maybe you can comment on the labor costs. In terms of our transition to cloud, we continue to be very happy with our applications moving to the cloud. We're seeing higher productivity, we're seeing better responsiveness. We measure our applications with the Google tools and they performed very, very well, both sort of in the US and globally. So we're very excited about that.

We don't want to manage them too aggressively because we don't want to pull demand down just for GoDaddy but we do want to follow the demand patterns. And what we are doing is that we're coupling that with investments in data science and better data and better technology that's allowing us to make a \u2013 measure that marketing spend better and better every year and be more efficient with it. And Mark I'll turn it to you for the labor cost comment. Thank you, Elizabeth. Specific to Google, we've been competing with Google on Domains for I think seven years or more. And the removal of sort of the beta logo if you will it doesn't change \u2013 sort of create any fundamental change in the industry from my view. Competing with the mega tech players is a fact of life for every tech business. So I feel we've been competing with them and sort of not much has changed with this little change from them. Yeah. I think majority of what we've talked about is new customers going through the site. In terms of our legacy customers, we continue to feel that is a big opportunity for GoDaddy. Anecdotally, we do see a set of customers that are attractive. So we know that our pricing makes sense. We know that, this is something we can scale. But that's part of this year's priority for us to get the go-to-market motions at scale across the company, so that we can go after not just the new but the legacy customers as well. But it's just \u2013 that is still work in progress. Yep. Thank you. Maybe just to say Brent appreciate the long-term view on the question. My view is that we have the secular trends around entrepreneurship around the Internet around commerce on the Internet. We're positioned really well. This is a critical need for micro and small businesses. So the TAM is large. GoDaddy's positioning is very, very good. It's mission-critical to customers. They don't -- in a difficult time customers don't give up their website or they don't give up their domain anymore. Lots of them don't do that. So from my perspective if times are tough for our customers that's actually opportunity for GoDaddy to do more for them. That's the opportunity to GoDaddy has to help them understand how they can navigate those times better. And as I shared about sort of the 2008 cohort we can end up with fantastic customers in all kinds of economic environments. Thank you.

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman and thank you everyone for joining us today. We are excited to share our strong Q1 results, which highlight our execution towards the targets we shared at our recent Investor Day. Our results demonstrate our focus on delivering a balanced combination of durable topline growth, profitability at scale, and robust cash flow and our performance shows GoDaddy's business resiliency. We are pleased that we were able to deliver a strong first quarter, while we actively manage through the uncertain global macro environment. In Q1, total revenue grew to $1 billion, which represents 12% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis and 11% year-over-year on a reported basis. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As shared earlier this year, we updated the lens by which we report the pillars of our revenue. This change transitioned our reporting from three revenue segments into two new segments; Applications and Commerce and Core Platform. This gives us the framework of how we will talk about our business and opportunities going forward. Applications and Commerce revenue, which includes presence in application solutions, grew 16% year-over-year. Coming in at the high end of our guidance range from February, our presence products such as Websites + Marketing contributed to this growth. And as Aman mentioned earlier, we drove great traction with the attach of our payment solution which will show up in this line item as it becomes more meaningful. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. ARR from our Create and Grow group of products which includes Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite, and GoDaddy Studio grew 13% year-over-year to $410 million. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $24 billion, growing 20% year-over-year. We achieved growth across all channels, primarily driven by off-line point-of-sale. Core Platform revenue which includes Domains, Hosting, and Security products grew 9% year-over-year, delivering above our February guide with 40% of the increase driven by aftermarket. ARR for Core Platform grew 5% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As a reminder, aftermarket performance does not impact ARR. Q1 bookings were $1.16 billion growing over 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a reported basis against tough comparisons from the strong year ago quarter. Additionally, Q1 bookings grew 10% sequentially against our largest ever Q4 quarter. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 9% year-over-year and Core Platform bookings grew 5% year-over-year. Normalized EBITDA grew 18% year-over-year to $226 million at a 23% margin, representing over a point of margin expansion compared to the same period last year and bringing our normalized EBITDA margins within the 23% to 24% guide we outlined at Investor Day. Our technology and development expenses increased as a percent of revenue this quarter as we focused on building our commerce and innovation strategies. Additionally, as we continued reopening offices in Q1 our G&A expenses also increased as a percentage of revenue while remaining below historical levels. We drove leverage in our marketing spend, based on continued execution of the formula outlined at Investor Day. Additionally, during Q1, we faced inflation pressures primarily in the form of increasing energy and cloud infrastructure expenses.  Currently, we have medium-term contracts and FX hedges to mitigate some of the foreseen impacts. We expect these inflation-related impacts to continue throughout 2022 and we will monitor and proactively address our exposure in these areas. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $287 million, growing 7% year-over-year driven by strong profitability. Additionally, during the quarter we began executing against our announced $3 billion authorized share repurchase through an initial $750 million accelerated share repurchase or ASR expected to be completed in May. Through Q1, we repurchased an initial 6.5 million shares reducing our total share count by 4% since year-end bringing our free cash flow per share, to $5.25 on a trailing 12-month basis versus prior year cash flow per share of $4.51 for an increase of 16%. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $743 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.3 billion. Net debt stands at $3.2 billion at the midpoint of our targeted range of two to four times. Moving on to our outlook. Given the solid start to our year and the predictability of our model, based on what we know now, we are comfortable with our full year 2022 outlook provided in February. Having said that we are not immune to the current macroeconomic environment, which increases our short-term exposure to foreign currency and customer demand fluctuations. While the environment remains fluid, we believe our predictable model allows us the flexibility to moderate our investments and leverage our operating expenses to seek to offset exposure to revenue from these factors. We also remain committed to delivering the $6-plus free cash flow per share discussed in February. For Q2, we are targeting total revenue in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. Within that we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 14% and 16% and Core Platform revenue to grow between 5% and 7%. For Q2, and full year bookings we expect growth to be approximately two points below revenue, primarily driven by FX pressure. We will continue investing in technology and development to drive our robust product launch momentum while balancing our goal for margin expansion through efficiencies in customer care and marketing. Normalized EBITDA for Q2, is expected to be in the range of $232 million to $237 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint. Our capital allocation strategy also remains unchanged. During the second and third quarter, we intend to fulfill our $1 billion buyback target for 2022 through an additional $250 million of share repurchases. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of rising interest rates and explore refinancing our term loan and revolver, with the intention of maintaining our leverage ratio of 2 to 4 times. Before I close, I want to reiterate that we remain laser-focused on execution and we have a track record of consistency in difficult times. We are marching towards delivering the 10% top line CAGR, 15% normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR, while buying back $3 billion of our stock over the next three years, that we described in detail in our Investor Day. We are balancing our near-term and long-term goals, emphasizing, delivering strong results, while at the same time investing in areas for future growth. GoDaddy leads in providing small business solutions, a position that we built by understanding the needs of our more than 21 million customers. While the current macro events present challenges, GoDaddy's resiliency comes from our long history of strong customer retention, the power of our existing cohorts and the competitive advantages we built as the champion for small businesses. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. Yes. Thanks, Aman, and Trevor. I think that's exactly right, Aman. I think you stole the buy line. We did shut down. It didn't have a significant impact on us. I would say, it's more of the macroeconomic trends that are impacting us throughout Europe, and there isn't a particular exposure to any region or country at this point to call out. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Clarke. Hey listen, we couldn't be more happier than the momentum we have in the aftermarket. And I think we've talked about it coming out of Q4. And we continue to see strong volume growth and average prices going up. And that's what we really track when we look at the momentum around there. It's hard to predict the larger transactions but we still see them coming in. And we still see the momentum obviously quarter-over-quarter that created within that market. Nothing to call out domestic versus -- or sorry, North America versus international. It seems to be just broad-based momentum in that market and we continue to be pleased with the amount of transactions and the volume that is going through there right now. Yeah. Clarke, I'll just add on to that. The cost is -- we don't look at it as a headwind. Yes, and that's great. I think in these times what we're hearing is that being a one-stop shop for our customer base, which is entrepreneurs and very small businesses becomes an opportunity. They are focusing on their business and their ability to really count on us to help make their go-to-market easier seems to be something that is resonating with them. And a reminder, we generate about 85% of our revenue coming from our existing 21 million customers. So our ability to give them relevant products in the market is just a huge upside for us and we look at it as very much a positive going forward. Yeah. And thanks Aaron. On labor costs we have been in a hypercompetitive environment for talent here for a number of years. So we've been constantly looking at how do we attract talent but yet have levers in place to moderate the cost buildup appropriately. And that hasn't changed, and we're not seeing anything that would cause us to think that that's going to be what we haven't built into our guide already. And we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the locations of our employees going forward to make sure we can maintain that into our three-year outlook. I'll jump into that one Aman. You can add color. You hit it right on the head there. It's \u2013 we're comping to a tough quarter last year. We did talk about January at Investor Day and some of the impacts in the market and we've seen positive momentum coming out of the quarter which gives us a lot of comfort as we get into the rest of the year. We're excited about it. So there's nothing in particular to call out that we haven't already mentioned. And we also are very happy that coming off a great Q4. The bookings growth was pretty strong. So we like the momentum, we like the opportunities out there in the market right now. Obviously, it's an interesting time, but we continue to manage through it and we feel good about where we think we're going to end up for the year and the quarter Q2. Yes. Brent, I'll take it on two ends on that one. One, us internally and then two customer demand. And Aman may have some comments on the customer end of it. One on our end we're -- I think it's in our prepared remarks or slide we're about 13% variable interest rate right now. So we think the impact for us in the quarter and the year will be minimal. Obviously, we will as we mentioned we look to refinance our term loan and our revolver. And if it makes sense we'll do so. But we think those are the things within our control. When it comes to our customer base it's hard to predict the overall impact of inflation, but we believe because our products help them do business and our ability to be a one-stop shop helps them ultimately be more efficient in the marketplace and focus on growing their business that we are an additive tool for them versus something they will have to choose between. But it's hard to look at the overall impact on the three years. And Aman I don't know if you want to add to that at all. I'll hit the first part of that and Aman maybe you can handle the second. And Sunil, I assume you're talking about the G&A line when you say overhead. It represents -- we started reopening our offices in Q1, so saw a small uptick as we got ready for that. It's still below historical levels and we expect it to be in one going forward and we're comfortable with where we are in our normalized EBITDA margins that we put out there in the guide and also for our three-year plan. But the specific increase was related to opening the offices in Q1. So when we look at the infrastructure cloud costs, we're still in the process of moving to the cloud. I think we've talked about that and our impact on our tech and dev line. And we still look at it as an opportunity to moderate our cost as well as reduce our capital expenditures going forward. Everything that we are looking at today we've included in the guide not only for the year, but for our three-year plan. And we feel comfortable with our normalized EBITDA margins where they are. Obviously, lots of puts and takes. But we're comfortable where we are and built in what we can see today."

At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy centers on creating customer value, driving profitable growth resulting in compounding free cash flow per share and long-term shareholder value. Our focus remains on margin expansion and growth in our Applications and Commerce segment. 2023 was a pivotal year for us and I am pleased with our financial and operational results. Innovation accelerated as we brought together our technology capabilities into a unified technology stack, enabling us to launch our compelling GoDaddy Airo experience. We also drove 2023 normalized EBITDA margin ahead of our guidance as we balanced investment in growth and cost structure management. Full year normalized EBITDA margin increased approximately 200 basis points, resulting in a 12% increase in free cash flow and a 21% increase in free cash flow per share. In Q4, we drove 16% bookings growth for our high margin segment, Applications and Commerce segment and this momentum continued into January. Our focus on the combination of optimizing costs and driving growth in Applications and Commerce, has positioned our business well to exit 2024 with a normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31%. At the Investor Day in November, we showcased how GoDaddy Airo delivers a seamless experience for identity and presence and our teams have launched even more capabilities since then. At our upcoming Investor Day on March 6, we will showcase these new capabilities as well as provide a sneak peek into what is coming soon. Airo enablement of Commerce features will also be showcased, which now expands the Airo experience across the entire entrepreneur\u2019s wheel, fully unlocking the full power of GoDaddy\u2019s software platform for our customers in a seamless and intuitive manner. Over the last few quarters, we covered our continued efforts to optimize our marketing spend and G&A expenses. We have had similar efforts in technology and development and care as well. In technology and development, the simplification and unification of our technology stack led to a material reduction in our server footprint and multiple areas of costs associated with it. We also expanded our access to talent globally and together, these items benefited both our capital and operating expenses. In care, we are harvesting the benefits of our investments in technology and global scale as customer preferences shifted towards asynchronous chat, and with continued room for leverage through the automation of tasks and the rollout of GoDaddy Airo for our care guides. Additionally, the power of data from our GoDaddy software platform bolsters our ability to drive faster decision-making and is expected to benefit both our margin and revenue opportunities. We are excited to share more about continued leverage opportunities driven by innovation in technology and care at our Investor Day in Tempe. As always, I would like to cover our high priority initiatives, but I will keep my comments here brief since we plan to share an expanded set of demos in March. To start, bundling has been a key focus for us as a part of our innovation in domains and productivity to drive attach. This initiative primarily benefits our high margin Applications and Commerce segment, and we expect our Airo experience to drive this higher over time. Airo has also created new engagement surfaces allowing us to deliver automated customer experiences that we will continue to improve over time. On GoDaddy Airo, I have an update on its performance since launch. I am happy to share that in a controlled experiment, customers that were part of the first test cohort for the Airo experience monetized at rates higher than those customers in the control group that were not exposed to the Airo experience. The increased monetization was due to attach and shifting the mix towards higher price and higher margin products. This is particularly encouraging because significant customer experience changes like Airo typically take many months of iterative improvement to outperform the control group. With this initial promising result, we have rolled out GoDaddy Airo to more customers in the U.S. We have also launched tests in international markets a few days ago. Our goal for Airo is to help more customers discover more products and engage with them at higher rates, leading to even greater monetization opportunities. As a result, we are closely monitoring cohort performance across discovery, engagement and monetization. Components of the GoDaddy Airo experience are also currently being tested in our Managed WordPress and hub experiences, creating opportunities to save our designers and developers time and effort. We are also testing the Airo experience in care so guides can support our customers better and faster. Our platform approach to GoDaddy Airo means that new capabilities are quickly coming to market. For example, we will test Airo Commerce functionality in the first half of this year, and these capabilities will extend to our partnerships as well. On Commerce, over the last year we proved that we can sell our payments solutions into our customer base, and it was the largest driver of GPV growth last year. In fact, annualized GPV for 2023 exceeded our expectations and grew a 125% year-over-year. As we enter 2024, we are looking forward to surfacing our Commerce capabilities more seamlessly with our Airo experience and doubling down on selling the full omni-commerce solution, driving higher margin subscription revenue. This is the last of a series of proof points that set up the Commerce business for the long term, which is aligned with our overall strategy of creating customer value that ultimately drives profitable growth. As Commerce subscription revenue takes center stage and GPV growth takes lower priority, we still expect to continue to scale our base of Commerce customers by growing GPV at healthy double-digits. In closing, as I look ahead at the rest of 2024, I am excited by our ability to drive margin improvement and growth in Applications and Commerce, which we expect together will result in impressive improvements in free cash flow per share. Behind these improving metrics is a talented workforce that is committed to ongoing innovation. For example, every week we launch new tests, methodically track results, and share results broadly across the organization, making us better every day. The operational discipline of compounding improvements and doubling down on proof points continues to crystallize our path forward and raise our confidence to achieve our targets. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks Aman. Hello everyone and thank you all for joining us. In 2023, we made significant strides in our ability to deliver a unified GoDaddy software platform for our customers. These efforts are reflected in our results that drove sustained double-digit growth of our Applications and Commerce revenue of 13% in the quarter, expansion of our Q4 normalized EBITDA margin above our target, delivering 29.5% and free cash flow per share above our target delivering $7.50 for the full year. Beginning with Q4 results, our high margin Applications and Commerce revenue grew 13% to $377 million and we delivered an expanded segment EBITDA margin of 44%, increasing 100 basis points since last quarter and 300 basis points since last year. ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 10% to $1.4 billion and our Create + Grow ARR was up 8% to $481 million. In Commerce, we drove significant growth in annualized GPV to $1.7 billion, more than doubling last year\u2019s performance as conversion of our existing customers to the GoDaddy software platform remains strong. Core Platform revenue grew 2% to $723 million in the fourth quarter and segment EBITDA margin grew to 32%, increasing 200 basis points since last quarter and 250 basis points since last year. ARR for Core Platform was $2.3 billion consistent with prior year. Growth in Core Platform during the fourth quarter was supported by domain's growth of 4%, a continued strong demand and price increases. Bookings growth in domains was 7%, providing a positive leading indicator for future domain revenue. In addition, aftermarket grew 14% to $118 million on increasing volume and easier comps. As a reminder, while aftermarket is stable on an annual basis, it is more difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter compared to our other businesses due to its transactional nature and that it relies on third-party sellers and buyers to determine a mutually acceptable price. Our gains in Core Platform were partially offset by an 11% decrease in hosting, as we continue our efforts to integrate GoDaddy\u2019s software platform. Bifurcating the hosting business, the continuing GoDaddy hosting revenue remains a stable, strong cash generator with high retention. The remainder of the portfolio decreased over the past several years and we have taken deliberate steps throughout 2023 to rationalize the business. We will continue to evaluate the components of this business, integrating platforms that are strategic and rationalizing platforms that are not accretive to our long-term financial model. Total revenue in Q4 topped $1.1 billion, growing 6% on a reported and constant currency basis. International revenue grew 4% on a reported and constant currency basis to $354 million. As a reminder, our migrations and our divestitures are primarily impacting international regions. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 16% on strong attach of productivity solutions and continued strength in our Create + Grow products. Core Platform bookings increased 3% due to the strong fourth quarter performance in domains, offset by migration and divestiture headwinds in hosting. Subscription bookings grew 200 basis points ahead of subscription revenue. Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 22% to $324 million, representing a 29.5% margin, and an expansion of nearly 400 basis points compared to Q4, 2022. The continued margin expansion was driven by the leverage gains we achieved in the second half of 2023 across all spend categories. As we shared last quarter, we continue to expect Q4, 2024 normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31% with continued margin expansion in the out years, while also driving innovation, like you saw with our GoDaddy Airo experience. As we think about this seamless experience for customers, Airo is possible, thanks to the work we have done to unify our technology stack into one software platform that include ownership of the data from domain through to transactions. And this serves as an accelerant to our model as we bundle and bring more products to market faster on the platform. With that, during the fourth quarter, we reduced our combined technology and development and capital spending by 7% from our migrations, divestitures and restructuring efforts throughout 2023, as well as from reduced data center capital expenditures. We expect that our technology and development spend will continue to decline in absolute dollars in 2024 compared to 2023, as most of this work was completed in 2023. Moving onto cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow grew 46% to $347 million, while free cash flow grew 51% to $305 million, despite a 13% increase in cash interest expense year-over-year. Free cash flow per share increased 21% to $7.50 per share, driven by growth in Applications and Commerce, operating leverage improvements and share repurchases throughout 2023, which is partially offset by an increase in cash interest expense. Turning to the balance sheet. We exited the year with $0.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and total liquidity of $1.5 billion. Net debt landed at $3.4 billion, below three times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. In January 2024, we refinanced $1.8 billion of outstanding principal to secure a 50 basis point interest rate reduction. This strategic adjustment along with the repricing completed in July 2023 are together expected to reduce annualized cash interest expense by approximately $22 million. Additionally, the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations totaled $2.6 billion, representing 34.2 million shares retired. This reduced our fully diluted shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations by over 20%, achieving our three-year targeted reduction ahead of schedule. Our buybacks over the last two years have driven impressive ROI for this capital outlay, demonstrating our disciplined capital allocation framework and dedication to driving long-term shareholder value. Moving onto our annual financial results. Total revenue grew 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis to $4.3 billion. ARPU grew 3% to $203 as we added 100,000 net new customers, despite the elevated churn from our ongoing platform migrations and divestitures. Customer retention remains 85% as we drove improvements in 2+ product attach, with greater than 50% of our customers paying for at least two products. These high-quality customers are stickier and give us greater pricing flexibility. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 12% to $1.4 billion and Core Platform revenue was flat, totaling $2.8 billion. International revenue grew 4% to $1.4 billion. Total bookings grew 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis to $4.6 billion. Full year normalized EBITDA grew 12% to $1.1 billion, representing a 27% margin for the year, an expansion of nearly 200 basis points over the prior year. Lastly, full year unlevered free cash flow grew 14% to $1.3 billion and free cash flow grew 12% to $1.1 billion, both exceeding our guide for the year and showing impressive normalized EBITDA to cash conversion of nearly one to one. Moving onto our outlook. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.48 billion to $4.56 billion, representing growth of over 6% at the midpoint of the range. When excluding the approximate 100 basis point impact of divestitures and migrations, that we will lap in the year, our growth would be 7% at the midpoint of the range. In Application and Commerce, we are projecting revenue growth of low to mid-teens for Q1 and the full year. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth of low single-digits for Q1 and the full year. As we have shared previously, the entire GoDaddy team is committed to maintaining operational discipline and deploying opportunities to gain further leverage within our model. We delivered on this commitment in 2023 and expect to continue this trend in 2024, resulting in an expected normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 29% for the full year. We are targeting unlevered free cash flow of at least $1.4 billion, free cash flow of at least $1.2 billion, and free cash flow per share of approximately $9, representing a growth rate of 20% for the full year of 2024. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of $35 million and cash interest payments of $155 million, representing reduced spend of 11% over 2023. In addition, we expect income tax payments of approximately $30 million. On share repurchases, we expect to buy back shares under our remaining $1.4 billion authorization using our disciplined capital allocation framework that we've applied in past quarters. Capital return has been and will continue to be a priority for GoDaddy, along with prudently managing our balance sheet, as we look to drive compounding returns for our shareholders. For Q1 2024, we are targeting total revenue of $1.085 billion to $1.105 billion, representing nearly 6% growth at the midpoint of the range. As a reminder, because of the timing of certain marketing spend, such as the spend that support our heavy renewal cycle in Q1 and the spend related to our launch of GoDaddy Airo, our normalized EBITDA margin will build over the course of 2024. As a result, we expect Q1 normalized EBITDA to be 27%, representing a nearly 300 basis point expansion over Q1, 2023. Over the course of the year, normalized EBITDA margin is expected to increase to approximately 31% as we exit the year, which averages to approximately 29% for the full year. We are proud of our record of accomplishment of increasing margins on an absolute basis and compared to our own initial guidance over the last three years. Investors should continue to see this discipline moving forward. In summary, we remain dedicated to actively managing our business through a combination of durable top line growth and improving profitability. We are focused on balancing the two to drive our strong free cash flow, which, when coupled with our disciplined capital allocation framework, creates significant value for our shareholders. We see an exciting path and have strong confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities. At our Investor Day on March 6th, we will demo the expanded capabilities of GoDaddy Airo and Commerce. We will also discuss long-term growth and profitability expectations and levers we will provide a clear view of our opportunities. We will share our capital allocation framework and the shareholder value it will create. We are committed to providing the information you need to understand our long-term strategy and initiatives, model the business confidently, value the business effectively, and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objectives. We'll end the day with Q&A, hosted by our management team. With that, I'll hand the call over to Christie Masoner, VP of Investor Relations, to open the call for Q&A.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yeah. Hi. Can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nAman Bhutani: We can.\nNaved Khan: Okay, great. So, two questions from me. One, maybe just on the big picture macro environment, just your views on where we are currently in terms of demand. And then in relation to that, where do you see or what would cause you to come in at the high-end of the range if you just gave versus at the low-end? So just kind of encapsulate that for us. And then the other question I had is around the billion-dollar in valuation allowance. I think you had a sort of a release in the valuation allowance. You already have a tax shield, which I think kind of protects you from paying taxes or meaningful amount of taxes until 2030 or 2031. Is this in addition to that? How should I think about the release?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Naved. Why don't I kick that off with a quick comment on the macro and I'll turn it to Mark for sort of the range and the valuation allowance. On the big picture, our customers continue to be the micro businesses and they're resilient crew and definitely we see strong demand continuing to come in through the front door. Of course, we continue to optimize our spend, marketing spend and be very, very judicious about finding new customers and bringing them to the site. But gross ads continue to be strong. And generally, I would say, our customers feel a little bit better about their prospects. Mark, I'll turn it to you.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah, absolutely. And thanks Naved. On the high end of the range, I mean, you're really looking at the market around, aftermarket. We have -- we've looked at it as a flat business to slightly growing single digits, but it's always subject to larger transactions, easier comps in Q4 this year. But it seems to be a flat business, but can vary in the range. Also, we have to look at the bundling efforts we're making. Airo is early stage. We're seeing customers come in the funnel. Aman said that, talked about the demand, but they're coming in and attaching that 2+ product. We're seeing a lot of momentum there. Obviously, continued momentum would be helpful. Commerce, we're seeing continued conversion of our existing customer base to our payment platform. There's always upside from pricing as we get into more value delivering in there. So, there's many different things that can put us to the high-end of the range. We like the momentum. Obviously, we call things as we see them today, and we feel really good about where we are and how that momentum is carrying forward. On the price -- on that \u2013 sorry -- on the tax, as a reminder, we paid a one-time $850 million fee in 2020 to buy the tax savings from our shareholders back in that time, right? And that was the NOLs and the credits that had built up over a period of time. For accounting reasons, that was reserved on our books and what you're seeing now because of our increased profitability and our ability to utilize that asset over what I would say a foreseeable period of time coming forward. Accounting rules require you release that when it's more likely than not you're going to get the benefit. So you saw that there. It's not cash. It doesn't affect cash, doesn't affect normalized EBITDA or anything along those lines, but it is a benefit the company will receive from taxes in the foreseeable future. So hopefully that answered your question there.\nNaved Khan: It does. Thanks guys.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Morrissey at Wolfe Research. Zach, please go ahead.\nZach Morrissey: Great. Thank you. I guess just starting with Airo, obviously, it seems -- early results are pretty encouraging, expanding the rollout. I guess, how do we think about like what are the gating factors to a more broad rollout, at least in the U.S., just based on the early results that you're seeing today. And kind of how is this embedded in the kind of 2024 outlook in terms of any kind of growth on the Application/Commerce side of things? And then on the legacy hosting, obviously, that came in a little bit weaker just based on some of the strategic decisions you guys are making. How do we think about the trajectory kind of embedded in the 2024 growth outlook for core platforms? I think comps get easier as we kind of progress through the year, but any kind of color and context would be helpful there.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Zach. On Airo, we're super excited about the Airo launch. It's not often new launch, a completely new experience and customers, who are used to a certain experience adopt it and it actually does better in the first test. So super encouraging results. We are actually rolling out Airo very, very quickly to more and more cohort of customers that starts with new customers. For example, when we first started in November, we were doing it for customers that bought a domain. Very quickly after that, we enabled it for customers that bought a domain and a website. And so, more and more Airo capabilities are showing up to more customers. We launched it in international too. Of course, the full swing is getting it to all of our new customers across the globe and then starting to penetrate the base as well, which where a ton of opportunity lies for us to be able to go to our basic customers and offer them these capabilities. So, I would say every week more customers are seeing Airo. We're actually moving as quickly as we can. I'm super happy with the team's progress. And in terms of the guidance, I'll turn it to Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. As Aman mentioned, you can hear the excitement. We're very encouraged about the momentum and the engagement metrics, but it is still early days. When we consolidated the core software platform for GoDaddy, we saw bundling and customers move into 2+ products a lot faster. And obviously Airo, we look at as an enabler of that down the road and we think it'll allow for greater bundling, greater catch, better retention. But right now it's early days and we're calling everything we see in front of us based on the momentum we see coming into the year. On the -- move on to the legacy hosting, a couple of things there, right? We have about 100 basis points of headwind coming into the year related to our divestitures and migrations that we've done. So that's built into the guide that we've given. In addition, we've seen aftermarket. We think it's going to be a flat to single digit grower, it's a $400 million plus business. We're really encouraged by the volume that's coming through the platform and the fact that it allows people to get names and in a secondary market, they couldn't get in the primary market. But we think it's going to be -- it's -- how do you say, moderated in its growth and it's leveled out. So, we've built that into the forecast. And we've talked about domains openly. We saw 4% revenue growth coming out of the quarter, but 7% bookings growth. So, we think there's a lot of momentum in the domains. And a lot of that has to do with the core GoDaddy platform now that we've launched and getting people the demand in, getting them to attach quicker, getting them to those retention rates we talk about in our model.\nZach Morrissey: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from a line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vik, please go ahead.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Hey, can you hear me?\nChristie Masoner: Yes, we can.\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Vikram.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Yeah. I just wanted to follow-up first on the Applications and Commerce segment. Appreciate the color, Mark, you just provided on Airo. But I guess outside of that, curious if you could talk about what the primary drivers of growth in that segment are going to be to support the low to mid-teens range in fiscal '24. And then separately, I also wanted to ask about the share repurchases. You mentioned the plan around the remaining $1.4 billion. I guess any color you could offer in terms of the cadence of repurchases going forward. And maybe if you could also just remind us of your broader capital allocation priorities and framework going forward and leave it there. Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Thanks Vikram. On A&C, the growth drivers, and we talk about this a lot, is we're seeing the demand move to that second product much faster than we had ever seen. And then now we're seeing it to the third product much faster than we've ever seen. So that shows up in our A&C growth. That's our higher profitability segment as well. So, it's driving a lot of our increased profitability and leverage within our model. But those are the drivers. Outside of Airo, it is the bundling. It's the customers, customers coming in with intent, customers moving to that second product. We've talked about once we get to the second product, our average retention is 85%, but it goes up from there. If we get customers to a third product, it goes up significantly. It's almost a customer for life. So, those are the things that are driving the momentum in A&C right now, and we're seeing that compounding. So, I would say between price, demand, attach, everything is driving that nice growth in there. On the share of purchases, there's been no change. We'll talk about it a little more on Investor Day, a little more broadly, but it's still a big part of our portfolio to return capital to our shareholders. We have 1.4 left on our authorization. We'll look at it in our discipline framework, quarter to quarter, based on what we see out there, and we'll make decisions as we go. We will talk about it a little bit more when we get to the Investor Day in March.\nAman Bhutani: And then maybe, Vik, just looking at it from a different lens, you asked about A&C. If you look at it as the components of the products that we sell in A&C, every part of A&C, or every significant part of A&C, is growing booking double-digits right now. Right? So that's really propelling that business and getting to that 16% bookings growth we talked about.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey, great. Thanks. Wanted to start off asking on payments, and perhaps you could just give us an idea about where you are at in terms of penetrating your existing customer base, or at least the addressable customer base. As we go into 2024, do you expect converting existing customers to be the biggest driver of growth again?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, thanks, Matt. We are still in very, very early stages of penetrating our customer base. We feel very comfortable that we have access to a lot of commerce intent customers within the base already. We do expect it to continue to be the largest driver of our growth in payments in 2024 as well. So, we expect very healthy growth. As I said in my prepared comments, we are going to expand what we're selling to these customers. We're going to go after more of the omni commerce solution. We're ready. We've got some great products, some great offerings. You'll see much of it in March as well. So, we're going to go broader with our offering to these customers, but the core payments functionality, we feel really good that will keep growing well.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. And just to follow-up on the guidance for A&C, the bookings growth of 16% in Q4 and then guiding for low to mid-teens in Q1, what's the discrepancy there? Is there payments or something else that drives that difference?\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks Matt. I would look at the overall business and the momentum we have going in. Remember, it's not just a subscription business. We have transactional and we have hardware shipments as well. So, we take that into account and we take into account the timing of those orders and when we think they're going out. So, there'll always be a little bit of a discrepancy between bookings and revenue related to that.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Just to make sure, what we talked about is 16% is bookings, right? Revenue is always going to lag a little bit, like Mark said, and you'll see it show up, of course.\nMatthew Pfau: Perfect. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is Jennie from Mark Mahaney. Just -- first a question on Airo again. Can you just give us more color, which international markets are you testing right now? And maybe also apart from driving product attach, what are the other potential monetization opportunities that you may be exploring for Airo? And then the second question is, you kind of mentioned greater attach gives you greater pricing flexibility. So, can you talk about ARPU? How should we think about ARPU growth drivers this year between just growing attach versus potentially taking up pricing? Like is price action baked into your full year out? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. On the international markets, our typical rollout plan is always English, large English markets first. So those are the markets we're testing now. But our absolute view is that Airo is a capability that should go across to all our markets. And there's a long tail of great tickets for us to approach there. So super excited about that. In terms of product attach and other monetization means, of course, product attach is the first level we're looking for. But as we'll share a little bit at our Investor Day, we're also looking for new monetization methods. And I'll just give you an example. One of the things that we want to test is a premium offering for logo building. Where -- as you see in Airo, you buy a domain and Airo builds you a logo and it builds you or gives you the ability to be able to edit that logo. But there are more services that we can offer around it. And we're going to test a new paywall for it and a new monetization method that GoDaddy has never done before. So that's one example of one of the types of things our teams are testing. And then I think in terms of the second part, I'll turn it to Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. So, anything we plan on doing pricing wise, just so you know, is built into our guide as we sit here today. We're excited about the bundling and the attach that's happening within Airo, within our software platform all together. And with 21 million customers, 14 million interactions with them, we get a lot of data about how they're getting value out of our products, which creates a lot of opportunity going forward around pricing bundles, elasticity around that, seeing the value they're driving. So, we think there's a lot of opportunity out there as we go forward. But right now, we've built in pricing actions as we usually do within our guide for the rest of the year. And we'll continue to evaluate and update as we go forward.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes to the line of Clarke Jeffries at Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Two questions for Mark. One is, you mentioned 100 basis point revenue headwind from some of those divestitures. Based off of the 7% or 8% domain bookings, it seems like there's strength there. I just wanted to ask clarification on when we'll see the revenue headwind sort of peak or trough during calendar 2024. It's 100 bps for the full year, but just any more color on intra quarter trends and then follow up.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Clarke, I would say it will be primarily the first half with some in the second half, but primarily in the first half.\nClarke Jeffries: All right, perfect. And then for that 200 bps of EBITDA margin expansion for next year, reflecting on what happened in 2023, marketing and advertising dollars did fall. But we've had a good discussion around the intent to reduce tech and dev spend. So, when you think about the driver of that 200 bps, any way you could frame mix shift of A&C reduction in tech and dev and anything incremental around marketing advertising dollar growth or percent of revenue for calendar '24 would be great. Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Thanks Clarke. And the way I look at it is if you take where we're exiting at Q4 of 2023 and where we're going for Q4 of 2024, the things that you have to look at are, reduced T&D spend, right? We're leveraging more of the AWS cloud. We're reducing dependency on data centers. There'll be a natural leverage we'll get in our P&L related to that. We're getting leverage in our care organization through the use of AI and automation, also access to global workforces that'll help us as we go forward. And then some of it is just the natural growing A&C picture, right? It's a more profitable segment. It's software based. Therefore, as that grows and becomes a bigger part of the picture, it helps expand our margins just naturally again, that leverage we get from the 2+ products starts to kick in the bigger A&C gets all together. So those are kind of the levers I'm looking at. Hopefully that's helpful.\nClarke Jeffries: Absolutely. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes to the line of Ygal Arounian from Citigroup. Ygal, please go ahead. Hey, Ygal.\nYgal Arounian: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I want to focus maybe on customer growth for a second. Is there any way to help us understand the impact of customers from the hosting divestitures? And I guess even if we normalize for that, we look at what customer growth has been historically versus what it's been over the past couple of years. You talk about a continued strong top line or top of the funnel, sorry, a customer growth that around 1%, let's call it. Historically, it's been anywhere from 2% to 4%. How are you guys thinking about customer growth right now? Or are you focused on a smaller subset of customers that might convert more easily? And you're looking to ARPU to fill in the gap. Do you think we can get back to that lower single-digit versus single digit or flattish customer growth number the next year or two?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. So I'll give some color for you, Ygal. When we look at our customers, we've always said we are targeting customers with a higher intent to do something when they come into the funnel, add that second product, start that business, generate value for themselves, and therefore generate value for us. What we've seen coming out of '23 and continuing into 2024 at the gross ads level is that consistent, strong demand that we've talked about all year and that continuing. And to put it in perspective, '23 gross customer ads was higher than 2022, right? And so not only are we seeing an increase there, we're seeing it more consistent from quarter to quarter and more stable.  With that, we're seeing that also that intentful customer come in with those gross ads, which is the momentum we're seeing in the bundling, the growth you see materialize in A&C. And we're seeing through the divestitures, we are losing customers, but they are generally customers that were low intent customers. So they were on a single product, maybe weren't doing things, hadn't done things for years. So that trade off is in there and continues to be something that we are working through on a net customer ad basis. Obviously, as we continue our divestitures and look at our portfolios, we've done a lot of that work in '23. So that will begin to abate for the work we've done in '23 and we'll continue to review our portfolio going forward. But it is bringing in the demand that has that higher intent customer and that stable demand we're seeing at the front of the funnel now.\nYgal Arounian: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then on -- understand the driver of GPV and bring more customers onto your paying platform. GMV is also continues to be really strong. Is there any way to qualify the growth drivers of GMV, whether it's by, I don't know, segment or business type or product, just to help to give a little bit more color around that? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, Ygal. A lot of what we talk about is GMV is often through our partnerships that we have. They tend to sell in the big categories, in the big verticals that you know about. Nothing significant to call out there, right? It follows to some extent the macro and sort of how customers are doing. Our focus very much is to provide them with a very competitive product so that they've got a system that works really well for them and it shows up in the results.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And I'll just add, the GPV is what we focus on because that's what we monetize within our customer base and that's what we're targeting to help grow payments.\nYgal Arounian: Thanks, guys.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Ken, please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Perfect. I just want to maybe kind of circle up on that 31% exit margin. You mentioned, a heavier spend in Q1 for renewals and launch costs. As we track to 31, would you expect that to be fairly linear or more back-end loaded, just given that there are some product investments up front?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. So, giving you color around, I'll say how we expect it to rollout. We talked about 27 in Q1 because of the spending related to our renewals and certain other timing and expenses. And then, 31 is our exit strategy with 29 being the average. So we do think -- we do, like we saw last year, believe it'll ladder up. We haven't gotten to the exact numbers yet. We'll provide more color around that as we get further into the year. But I think you can put a trajectory around there. Now, there might be some timing of marketing expenses that we'll talk you through if that were to happen. But other than that, I would expect it to be similar to what we saw this year in laddering up through the year.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the optimization side. Obviously, those are efforts that you guys will continue to push forward on and perhaps some new ones that you guys will talk about at Investor Day. As we look at the outlook, I guess, how much incremental optimization is already baked in there or are those plans yet to launch post-Investor Day?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. When we think about optimization and guiding to it, everything we have line of sight to is in the guidance already. But the fact is we're constantly evaluating new opportunities. Our teams have a very disciplined approach to looking at those opportunities and they bring forward proof points and what they need to do to be able to achieve those targets. And every quarter we're evaluating them and moving forward with new ideas. And if anything were to evolve, we would absolutely tell you more. We have a great track record of doing that over the last couple of years. And our goal is to just continue that momentum, continue that discipline. And it just compounds and that's a great thing.\nKen Wong: Great. Fantastic. Thanks, guys.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\nElizabeth Porter: Hi. Thanks for the question. I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity and just the walk for the fiscal '24 guide of 6% versus the exit rate in Q4 around 6%. I appreciate the disclosure on about one point from divestitures and migrations, but it feels like there's a couple of benefits as well, whether it's the aftermarket easing or pricing. And so, I'd love to just get a better sense on the view that you're taking on the underlying growth of the business and how that changes relative to Q4, just given some of the momentum bookings -- momentum that we've seen in bookings exiting the year. Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Thanks Elizabeth. Just a little further color, we're seeing the momentum in A&C and we've talked about the bookings. We've talked about the headwinds related to some of the divestiture activity. There are other things we built in there for the acquired or non-strategic hosting assets that still exist that haven't been integrated. We're assuming they're flat to down for the year as we continue to evaluate their long-term prospects. Things like aftermarket, we're assuming will be flat for the year, maybe slightly up, but again, no momentum being grown there -- coming there from continued growth in that market. That could change. There's some volatility in that market quarter to quarter, but we think on a long-term basis, that'll be the way to measure it. Still good growth in domains. It's still something that we're big in growing at percentage point wise is always difficult on a big base, but we think it'll be a steady increase as we see that demand coming in. So, when you put that all up and you put the headwinds into there at the first part of the year, we think 6% is a good point for the middle of the range. We know there's opportunities for the high-end of the range and we'll continue to monitor those.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Then just as a follow-up, when we think more holistically about the business, when you tend to have revenue upside, is that more likely to flow through on the margin side, just given you guys have already made a lot of improvements on the margin thus far? Or would you look to take any of that upside and potentially aggress more aggressively into the business, just given the opportunities ahead?\nAman Bhutani: I think it's hard to project sort of multiple scenarios there, Elizabeth. It also kind of depends on the product mix in terms of which products exceed targets, but generally we're looking to, on a regular basis, balance growth and profitability. Again, our teams have a pretty disciplined process of bringing proof points in on where we invest and how we double down. On investments, something changes, our goal is to be very transparent with you guys on the call as well, so you'll be able to be on that journey with us.\nMark McCaffrey: I think Aman put it perfect. We balance the growth and the profitability. Our goal is to drive free cash flow and ultimately free cash flow per share. We're constantly looking at the ways to do that and the ways to be creative to the long-term model. And we'll constantly evaluate what creates that opportunity for us that we can go into the future.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of John Byun on for Brent Thill at Jefferies. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Byun: Hi, thank you. I just had two questions. One, going back to Airo. I wonder if there's a way for you to quantify how broadly it might be rolled out in the U.S. I mean, is it 5% of your users using it? Or if there's any way to quantify in what you might think it might be by the end of the year or in sort of phase? And then the second question, kind of going back to the guidance and some of the headwinds, I think you had about 100 basis points in '23, guiding for about 124 with, I guess, abating in the second half. But wondering, will it be pretty much done at this point? Or do you still have maybe, I guess, more to reorganize, given some of the -- I guess, some of the still legacy hosting grantees who have left? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Let me start with Airo, John. We don't have sort of a number to disclose today, but we are looking forward to talking about this at our Investor Day. It's one of the things we are going to share with you. But just to give you order of magnitude, in the first six, eight weeks, hundreds of thousands of customers had already seen the Airo experience. So, this was not a small rollout by any stretch of the imagination. And that's just new customers, purchasing customers that I'm talking about. And you talked about sort of where we expect to get by the end of the year. Our timelines for Airo are much more aggressive than that. We expect a very large percentage of our new customers to be seeing Airo within the next few months. And by the end of the year, looking much more at how our existing customers are starting to engage with Airo and how can we make a real difference there. And I'll turn it to Mark for the headwind, 100 bps.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. So, we did a lot of work in 2023, and that caused 100 basis points headwinds, both in '23 and '24. We're still continuing to evaluate our portfolio and we'll take any actions that we need to related to things that may not be strategic or things that aren't going to be accretive long-term to our model. So I wouldn't say we're done. I would say we'll continue to optimize, evaluate and make the decisions for the long-term business best we can.\nJohn Byun: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich from UBS. Chris, please go ahead.\nChris Kuntarich: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe the first one would just be a clarification. When you're talking about the current Airo flow versus the Commerce Airo flow that we're going to be learning more about at the Analyst Day, can you just talk about maybe what products are not being included today as we're thinking about the existing flow? Is it really just payments or is there something else, kind of key products that we should be thinking about existing flow versus an Airo Commerce flow?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. What you saw us launch in November was Airo capabilities, mostly on our identity and presence products. And if you look at the entrepreneur's wheel, right, we lay out identity, presence and commerce and the customer needs that surround them. What we're going to show you at Investor Day is a sneak peek into all of the commerce capability layered with Airo, which includes not just payments capability, but core commerce functionality like inventory management and catalogs and how Airo will work on hardware, for example, versus on the web where today when we talk about identity and presence, you're seeing Airo capabilities mostly on the web. But how does that translate to a piece of hardware that a customer is holding and taking a transaction on?\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Very helpful. And just one follow up on the divestitures, any color to help us think about the margin benefit that they deliver from divestiture versus the full year guide?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. I haven't quantified it out to the exact numbers, but keep in mind it benefits us in two areas. One, obviously it helps on normalized EBITDA on a go forward basis, but also reduces our CapEx spend because a lot of these divestitures related to also data centers that we no longer need and will go with the acquiring entity. So, there are two benefits we see. Both triangulate around helping our free cash flow and generating our free cash flow growth going forward.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Thanks Mark. Thanks Aman.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes to the line of Ella Smith on for Alexei Gogolev at JP Morgan. Ella, please go ahead.\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Ella.\nElla Smith: Hi, team. Thank you for taking my question. It seems like price had the most to do with the margin expansion in the A&C segment. Is the spread of margin profiles of A&C products wide? If so, can you remind us what are the highest margin A&C products that drove the expansion?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. I don't know, Ella, if we've gotten into that detail before, so I'll give you some high level and then hopefully that's helpful for you. A&C in and of itself is a higher margin business for us. There are certain areas that are from a gross margin perspective a little lower, for example, payments where we have the transaction fee, but they're coupled with software and subscriptions that drive it up. So when we look at it from a bundling perspective, they are very accretive to the margin as well as the normalized EBITDA line. I would say when I look at what's driving the growth in A&C, you have to look at it from -- there is a pricing aspect of it, no doubt, as we increase prices across certain products, but there also is a demand element of it, which when we see that customer go to that second product, we get the increase on that as well. So I would say it's a good mix. We haven't gotten into breaking down X times Y, but all that's contributing to the growth in A&C right now.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. And maybe to add some of the data we have shared, our website products, so Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress are our highest margin products and they're growing double-digits. So obviously that's driving goodness in the A&C segment.\nElla Smith: Great. Thank you, Aman and Mark. And for my second question, can you please speak about GoDaddy Payments and your latest strategies there? Also, how would you describe the customer profile of those who are adopting GoDaddy Payments?\nAman Bhutani: The customer profile for GoDaddy Payments very much sort of squarely within the overall GoDaddy customer. We started with the micro seller, people selling $50,000, $100,000 a year, and we built up the million dollars, a customer who sells million dollars a year are now over a million dollars. That's the target market. That's what the product is targeted towards. So, we're very happy with the products we're growing. We're adding more capabilities in 2024. We're just going to keep broadening the omni commerce solution and tuning our go-to market. And that's what we're most excited about is just selling that broader view to our customers, like Mark said, getting to that really that third product that locks in retention for the long-term.\nElla Smith: Great. Thank you so much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: [Operator Instructions] It doesn't look like we have any more questions. We are at the top of the hour, so I'm going to hand it back over to Aman.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. And thank you all for joining us. We're looking forward to seeing you at our Investor Day. We're excited about it. We have a lot of cool stuff to show and hopefully you're able to make it. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy centers on creating customer value, driving profitable growth resulting in compounding free cash flow per share and long-term shareholder value. Our focus remains on margin expansion and growth in our Applications and Commerce segment. 2023 was a pivotal year for us and I am pleased with our financial and operational results. Innovation accelerated as we brought together our technology capabilities into a unified technology stack, enabling us to launch our compelling GoDaddy Airo experience. We also drove 2023 normalized EBITDA margin ahead of our guidance as we balanced investment in growth and cost structure management. Full year normalized EBITDA margin increased approximately 200 basis points, resulting in a 12% increase in free cash flow and a 21% increase in free cash flow per share. In Q4, we drove 16% bookings growth for our high margin segment, Applications and Commerce segment and this momentum continued into January. Our focus on the combination of optimizing costs and driving growth in Applications and Commerce, has positioned our business well to exit 2024 with a normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31%. At the Investor Day in November, we showcased how GoDaddy Airo delivers a seamless experience for identity and presence and our teams have launched even more capabilities since then. At our upcoming Investor Day on March 6, we will showcase these new capabilities as well as provide a sneak peek into what is coming soon. Airo enablement of Commerce features will also be showcased, which now expands the Airo experience across the entire entrepreneur's wheel, fully unlocking the full power of GoDaddy's software platform for our customers in a seamless and intuitive manner. Over the last few quarters, we covered our continued efforts to optimize our marketing spend and G&A expenses. We have had similar efforts in technology and development and care as well. In technology and development, the simplification and unification of our technology stack led to a material reduction in our server footprint and multiple areas of costs associated with it. We also expanded our access to talent globally and together, these items benefited both our capital and operating expenses. In care, we are harvesting the benefits of our investments in technology and global scale as customer preferences shifted towards asynchronous chat, and with continued room for leverage through the automation of tasks and the rollout of GoDaddy Airo for our care guides. Additionally, the power of data from our GoDaddy software platform bolsters our ability to drive faster decision-making and is expected to benefit both our margin and revenue opportunities. We are excited to share more about continued leverage opportunities driven by innovation in technology and care at our Investor Day in Tempe. As always, I would like to cover our high priority initiatives, but I will keep my comments here brief since we plan to share an expanded set of demos in March. To start, bundling has been a key focus for us as a part of our innovation in domains and productivity to drive attach. This initiative primarily benefits our high margin Applications and Commerce segment, and we expect our Airo experience to drive this higher over time. Airo has also created new engagement surfaces allowing us to deliver automated customer experiences that we will continue to improve over time. On GoDaddy Airo, I have an update on its performance since launch. I am happy to share that in a controlled experiment, customers that were part of the first test cohort for the Airo experience monetized at rates higher than those customers in the control group that were not exposed to the Airo experience. The increased monetization was due to attach and shifting the mix towards higher price and higher margin products. This is particularly encouraging because significant customer experience changes like Airo typically take many months of iterative improvement to outperform the control group. With this initial promising result, we have rolled out GoDaddy Airo to more customers in the U.S. We have also launched tests in international markets a few days ago. Our goal for Airo is to help more customers discover more products and engage with them at higher rates, leading to even greater monetization opportunities. As a result, we are closely monitoring cohort performance across discovery, engagement and monetization. Components of the GoDaddy Airo experience are also currently being tested in our Managed WordPress and hub experiences, creating opportunities to save our designers and developers time and effort. We are also testing the Airo experience in care so guides can support our customers better and faster. Our platform approach to GoDaddy Airo means that new capabilities are quickly coming to market. For example, we will test Airo Commerce functionality in the first half of this year, and these capabilities will extend to our partnerships as well. On Commerce, over the last year we proved that we can sell our payments solutions into our customer base, and it was the largest driver of GPV growth last year. In fact, annualized GPV for 2023 exceeded our expectations and grew a 125% year-over-year. As we enter 2024, we are looking forward to surfacing our Commerce capabilities more seamlessly with our Airo experience and doubling down on selling the full omni-commerce solution, driving higher margin subscription revenue. This is the last of a series of proof points that set up the Commerce business for the long term, which is aligned with our overall strategy of creating customer value that ultimately drives profitable growth. As Commerce subscription revenue takes center stage and GPV growth takes lower priority, we still expect to continue to scale our base of Commerce customers by growing GPV at healthy double-digits. In closing, as I look ahead at the rest of 2024, I am excited by our ability to drive margin improvement and growth in Applications and Commerce, which we expect together will result in impressive improvements in free cash flow per share. Behind these improving metrics is a talented workforce that is committed to ongoing innovation. For example, every week we launch new tests, methodically track results, and share results broadly across the organization, making us better every day. The operational discipline of compounding improvements and doubling down on proof points continues to crystallize our path forward and raise our confidence to achieve our targets. With that, here's Mark. We can. Thanks Naved. Why don't I kick that off with a quick comment on the macro and I'll turn it to Mark for sort of the range and the valuation allowance. On the big picture, our customers continue to be the micro businesses and they're resilient crew and definitely we see strong demand continuing to come in through the front door. Of course, we continue to optimize our spend, marketing spend and be very, very judicious about finding new customers and bringing them to the site. But gross ads continue to be strong. And generally, I would say, our customers feel a little bit better about their prospects. Mark, I'll turn it to you. Thanks Zach. On Airo, we're super excited about the Airo launch. It's not often new launch, a completely new experience and customers, who are used to a certain experience adopt it and it actually does better in the first test. So super encouraging results. We are actually rolling out Airo very, very quickly to more and more cohort of customers that starts with new customers. For example, when we first started in November, we were doing it for customers that bought a domain. Very quickly after that, we enabled it for customers that bought a domain and a website. And so, more and more Airo capabilities are showing up to more customers. We launched it in international too. Of course, the full swing is getting it to all of our new customers across the globe and then starting to penetrate the base as well, which where a ton of opportunity lies for us to be able to go to our basic customers and offer them these capabilities. So, I would say every week more customers are seeing Airo. We're actually moving as quickly as we can. I'm super happy with the team's progress. And in terms of the guidance, I'll turn it to Mark. Hey, Vikram. And then maybe, Vik, just looking at it from a different lens, you asked about A&C. If you look at it as the components of the products that we sell in A&C, every part of A&C, or every significant part of A&C, is growing booking double-digits right now. Right? So that's really propelling that business and getting to that 16% bookings growth we talked about. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Matt. We are still in very, very early stages of penetrating our customer base. We feel very comfortable that we have access to a lot of commerce intent customers within the base already. We do expect it to continue to be the largest driver of our growth in payments in 2024 as well. So, we expect very healthy growth. As I said in my prepared comments, we are going to expand what we're selling to these customers. We're going to go after more of the omni commerce solution. We're ready. We've got some great products, some great offerings. You'll see much of it in March as well. So, we're going to go broader with our offering to these customers, but the core payments functionality, we feel really good that will keep growing well. Yeah. Just to make sure, what we talked about is 16% is bookings, right? Revenue is always going to lag a little bit, like Mark said, and you'll see it show up, of course. Yeah. On the international markets, our typical rollout plan is always English, large English markets first. So those are the markets we're testing now. But our absolute view is that Airo is a capability that should go across to all our markets. And there's a long tail of great tickets for us to approach there. So super excited about that. In terms of product attach and other monetization means, of course, product attach is the first level we're looking for. But as we'll share a little bit at our Investor Day, we're also looking for new monetization methods. And I'll just give you an example. One of the things that we want to test is a premium offering for logo building. Where -- as you see in Airo, you buy a domain and Airo builds you a logo and it builds you or gives you the ability to be able to edit that logo. But there are more services that we can offer around it. And we're going to test a new paywall for it and a new monetization method that GoDaddy has never done before. So that's one example of one of the types of things our teams are testing. And then I think in terms of the second part, I'll turn it to Mark. Yes, Ygal. A lot of what we talk about is GMV is often through our partnerships that we have. They tend to sell in the big categories, in the big verticals that you know about. Nothing significant to call out there, right? It follows to some extent the macro and sort of how customers are doing. Our focus very much is to provide them with a very competitive product so that they've got a system that works really well for them and it shows up in the results. Thank you. Yeah. When we think about optimization and guiding to it, everything we have line of sight to is in the guidance already. But the fact is we're constantly evaluating new opportunities. Our teams have a very disciplined approach to looking at those opportunities and they bring forward proof points and what they need to do to be able to achieve those targets. And every quarter we're evaluating them and moving forward with new ideas. And if anything were to evolve, we would absolutely tell you more. We have a great track record of doing that over the last couple of years. And our goal is to just continue that momentum, continue that discipline. And it just compounds and that's a great thing. I think it's hard to project sort of multiple scenarios there, Elizabeth. It also kind of depends on the product mix in terms of which products exceed targets, but generally we're looking to, on a regular basis, balance growth and profitability. Again, our teams have a pretty disciplined process of bringing proof points in on where we invest and how we double down. On investments, something changes, our goal is to be very transparent with you guys on the call as well, so you'll be able to be on that journey with us. Yeah. Let me start with Airo, John. We don't have sort of a number to disclose today, but we are looking forward to talking about this at our Investor Day. It's one of the things we are going to share with you. But just to give you order of magnitude, in the first six, eight weeks, hundreds of thousands of customers had already seen the Airo experience. So, this was not a small rollout by any stretch of the imagination. And that's just new customers, purchasing customers that I'm talking about. And you talked about sort of where we expect to get by the end of the year. Our timelines for Airo are much more aggressive than that. We expect a very large percentage of our new customers to be seeing Airo within the next few months. And by the end of the year, looking much more at how our existing customers are starting to engage with Airo and how can we make a real difference there. And I'll turn it to Mark for the headwind, 100 bps. Yeah. What you saw us launch in November was Airo capabilities, mostly on our identity and presence products. And if you look at the entrepreneur's wheel, right, we lay out identity, presence and commerce and the customer needs that surround them. What we're going to show you at Investor Day is a sneak peek into all of the commerce capability layered with Airo, which includes not just payments capability, but core commerce functionality like inventory management and catalogs and how Airo will work on hardware, for example, versus on the web where today when we talk about identity and presence, you're seeing Airo capabilities mostly on the web. But how does that translate to a piece of hardware that a customer is holding and taking a transaction on? Hey, Ella. Yeah. And maybe to add some of the data we have shared, our website products, so Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress are our highest margin products and they're growing double-digits. So obviously that's driving goodness in the A&C segment. The customer profile for GoDaddy Payments very much sort of squarely within the overall GoDaddy customer. We started with the micro seller, people selling $50,000, $100,000 a year, and we built up the million dollars, a customer who sells million dollars a year are now over a million dollars. That's the target market. That's what the product is targeted towards. So, we're very happy with the products we're growing. We're adding more capabilities in 2024. We're just going to keep broadening the omni commerce solution and tuning our go-to market. And that's what we're most excited about is just selling that broader view to our customers, like Mark said, getting to that really that third product that locks in retention for the long-term. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks Aman. Hello everyone and thank you all for joining us. In 2023, we made significant strides in our ability to deliver a unified GoDaddy software platform for our customers. These efforts are reflected in our results that drove sustained double-digit growth of our Applications and Commerce revenue of 13% in the quarter, expansion of our Q4 normalized EBITDA margin above our target, delivering 29.5% and free cash flow per share above our target delivering $7.50 for the full year. Beginning with Q4 results, our high margin Applications and Commerce revenue grew 13% to $377 million and we delivered an expanded segment EBITDA margin of 44%, increasing 100 basis points since last quarter and 300 basis points since last year. ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 10% to $1.4 billion and our Create + Grow ARR was up 8% to $481 million. In Commerce, we drove significant growth in annualized GPV to $1.7 billion, more than doubling last year's performance as conversion of our existing customers to the GoDaddy software platform remains strong. Core Platform revenue grew 2% to $723 million in the fourth quarter and segment EBITDA margin grew to 32%, increasing 200 basis points since last quarter and 250 basis points since last year. ARR for Core Platform was $2.3 billion consistent with prior year. Growth in Core Platform during the fourth quarter was supported by domain's growth of 4%, a continued strong demand and price increases. Bookings growth in domains was 7%, providing a positive leading indicator for future domain revenue. In addition, aftermarket grew 14% to $118 million on increasing volume and easier comps. As a reminder, while aftermarket is stable on an annual basis, it is more difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter compared to our other businesses due to its transactional nature and that it relies on third-party sellers and buyers to determine a mutually acceptable price. Our gains in Core Platform were partially offset by an 11% decrease in hosting, as we continue our efforts to integrate GoDaddy's software platform. Bifurcating the hosting business, the continuing GoDaddy hosting revenue remains a stable, strong cash generator with high retention. The remainder of the portfolio decreased over the past several years and we have taken deliberate steps throughout 2023 to rationalize the business. We will continue to evaluate the components of this business, integrating platforms that are strategic and rationalizing platforms that are not accretive to our long-term financial model. Total revenue in Q4 topped $1.1 billion, growing 6% on a reported and constant currency basis. International revenue grew 4% on a reported and constant currency basis to $354 million. As a reminder, our migrations and our divestitures are primarily impacting international regions. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 16% on strong attach of productivity solutions and continued strength in our Create + Grow products. Core Platform bookings increased 3% due to the strong fourth quarter performance in domains, offset by migration and divestiture headwinds in hosting. Subscription bookings grew 200 basis points ahead of subscription revenue. Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 22% to $324 million, representing a 29.5% margin, and an expansion of nearly 400 basis points compared to Q4, 2022. The continued margin expansion was driven by the leverage gains we achieved in the second half of 2023 across all spend categories. As we shared last quarter, we continue to expect Q4, 2024 normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31% with continued margin expansion in the out years, while also driving innovation, like you saw with our GoDaddy Airo experience. As we think about this seamless experience for customers, Airo is possible, thanks to the work we have done to unify our technology stack into one software platform that include ownership of the data from domain through to transactions. And this serves as an accelerant to our model as we bundle and bring more products to market faster on the platform. With that, during the fourth quarter, we reduced our combined technology and development and capital spending by 7% from our migrations, divestitures and restructuring efforts throughout 2023, as well as from reduced data center capital expenditures. We expect that our technology and development spend will continue to decline in absolute dollars in 2024 compared to 2023, as most of this work was completed in 2023. Moving onto cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow grew 46% to $347 million, while free cash flow grew 51% to $305 million, despite a 13% increase in cash interest expense year-over-year. Free cash flow per share increased 21% to $7.50 per share, driven by growth in Applications and Commerce, operating leverage improvements and share repurchases throughout 2023, which is partially offset by an increase in cash interest expense. Turning to the balance sheet. We exited the year with $0.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and total liquidity of $1.5 billion. Net debt landed at $3.4 billion, below three times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. In January 2024, we refinanced $1.8 billion of outstanding principal to secure a 50 basis point interest rate reduction. This strategic adjustment along with the repricing completed in July 2023 are together expected to reduce annualized cash interest expense by approximately $22 million. Additionally, the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations totaled $2.6 billion, representing 34.2 million shares retired. This reduced our fully diluted shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations by over 20%, achieving our three-year targeted reduction ahead of schedule. Our buybacks over the last two years have driven impressive ROI for this capital outlay, demonstrating our disciplined capital allocation framework and dedication to driving long-term shareholder value. Moving onto our annual financial results. Total revenue grew 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis to $4.3 billion. ARPU grew 3% to $203 as we added 100,000 net new customers, despite the elevated churn from our ongoing platform migrations and divestitures. Customer retention remains 85% as we drove improvements in 2+ product attach, with greater than 50% of our customers paying for at least two products. These high-quality customers are stickier and give us greater pricing flexibility. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 12% to $1.4 billion and Core Platform revenue was flat, totaling $2.8 billion. International revenue grew 4% to $1.4 billion. Total bookings grew 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis to $4.6 billion. Full year normalized EBITDA grew 12% to $1.1 billion, representing a 27% margin for the year, an expansion of nearly 200 basis points over the prior year. Lastly, full year unlevered free cash flow grew 14% to $1.3 billion and free cash flow grew 12% to $1.1 billion, both exceeding our guide for the year and showing impressive normalized EBITDA to cash conversion of nearly one to one. Moving onto our outlook. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.48 billion to $4.56 billion, representing growth of over 6% at the midpoint of the range. When excluding the approximate 100 basis point impact of divestitures and migrations, that we will lap in the year, our growth would be 7% at the midpoint of the range. In Application and Commerce, we are projecting revenue growth of low to mid-teens for Q1 and the full year. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth of low single-digits for Q1 and the full year. As we have shared previously, the entire GoDaddy team is committed to maintaining operational discipline and deploying opportunities to gain further leverage within our model. We delivered on this commitment in 2023 and expect to continue this trend in 2024, resulting in an expected normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 29% for the full year. We are targeting unlevered free cash flow of at least $1.4 billion, free cash flow of at least $1.2 billion, and free cash flow per share of approximately $9, representing a growth rate of 20% for the full year of 2024. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of $35 million and cash interest payments of $155 million, representing reduced spend of 11% over 2023. In addition, we expect income tax payments of approximately $30 million. On share repurchases, we expect to buy back shares under our remaining $1.4 billion authorization using our disciplined capital allocation framework that we've applied in past quarters. Capital return has been and will continue to be a priority for GoDaddy, along with prudently managing our balance sheet, as we look to drive compounding returns for our shareholders. For Q1 2024, we are targeting total revenue of $1.085 billion to $1.105 billion, representing nearly 6% growth at the midpoint of the range. As a reminder, because of the timing of certain marketing spend, such as the spend that support our heavy renewal cycle in Q1 and the spend related to our launch of GoDaddy Airo, our normalized EBITDA margin will build over the course of 2024. As a result, we expect Q1 normalized EBITDA to be 27%, representing a nearly 300 basis point expansion over Q1, 2023. Over the course of the year, normalized EBITDA margin is expected to increase to approximately 31% as we exit the year, which averages to approximately 29% for the full year. We are proud of our record of accomplishment of increasing margins on an absolute basis and compared to our own initial guidance over the last three years. Investors should continue to see this discipline moving forward. In summary, we remain dedicated to actively managing our business through a combination of durable top line growth and improving profitability. We are focused on balancing the two to drive our strong free cash flow, which, when coupled with our disciplined capital allocation framework, creates significant value for our shareholders. We see an exciting path and have strong confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities. At our Investor Day on March 6th, we will demo the expanded capabilities of GoDaddy Airo and Commerce. We will also discuss long-term growth and profitability expectations and levers we will provide a clear view of our opportunities. We will share our capital allocation framework and the shareholder value it will create. We are committed to providing the information you need to understand our long-term strategy and initiatives, model the business confidently, value the business effectively, and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objectives. We'll end the day with Q&A, hosted by our management team. With that, I'll hand the call over to Christie Masoner, VP of Investor Relations, to open the call for Q&A. Yeah, absolutely. And thanks Naved. On the high end of the range, I mean, you're really looking at the market around, aftermarket. We have -- we've looked at it as a flat business to slightly growing single digits, but it's always subject to larger transactions, easier comps in Q4 this year. But it seems to be a flat business, but can vary in the range. Also, we have to look at the bundling efforts we're making. Airo is early stage. We're seeing customers come in the funnel. Aman said that, talked about the demand, but they're coming in and attaching that 2+ product. We're seeing a lot of momentum there. Obviously, continued momentum would be helpful. Commerce, we're seeing continued conversion of our existing customer base to our payment platform. There's always upside from pricing as we get into more value delivering in there. So, there's many different things that can put us to the high-end of the range. We like the momentum. Obviously, we call things as we see them today, and we feel really good about where we are and how that momentum is carrying forward. On the price -- on that \u2013 sorry -- on the tax, as a reminder, we paid a one-time $850 million fee in 2020 to buy the tax savings from our shareholders back in that time, right? And that was the NOLs and the credits that had built up over a period of time. For accounting reasons, that was reserved on our books and what you're seeing now because of our increased profitability and our ability to utilize that asset over what I would say a foreseeable period of time coming forward. Accounting rules require you release that when it's more likely than not you're going to get the benefit. So you saw that there. It's not cash. It doesn't affect cash, doesn't affect normalized EBITDA or anything along those lines, but it is a benefit the company will receive from taxes in the foreseeable future. So hopefully that answered your question there. Yeah. As Aman mentioned, you can hear the excitement. We're very encouraged about the momentum and the engagement metrics, but it is still early days. When we consolidated the core software platform for GoDaddy, we saw bundling and customers move into 2+ products a lot faster. And obviously Airo, we look at as an enabler of that down the road and we think it'll allow for greater bundling, greater catch, better retention. But right now it's early days and we're calling everything we see in front of us based on the momentum we see coming into the year. On the -- move on to the legacy hosting, a couple of things there, right? We have about 100 basis points of headwind coming into the year related to our divestitures and migrations that we've done. So that's built into the guide that we've given. In addition, we've seen aftermarket. We think it's going to be a flat to single digit grower, it's a $400 million plus business. We're really encouraged by the volume that's coming through the platform and the fact that it allows people to get names and in a secondary market, they couldn't get in the primary market. But we think it's going to be -- it's -- how do you say, moderated in its growth and it's leveled out. So, we've built that into the forecast. And we've talked about domains openly. We saw 4% revenue growth coming out of the quarter, but 7% bookings growth. So, we think there's a lot of momentum in the domains. And a lot of that has to do with the core GoDaddy platform now that we've launched and getting people the demand in, getting them to attach quicker, getting them to those retention rates we talk about in our model. Yeah. Thanks Vikram. On A&C, the growth drivers, and we talk about this a lot, is we're seeing the demand move to that second product much faster than we had ever seen. And then now we're seeing it to the third product much faster than we've ever seen. So that shows up in our A&C growth. That's our higher profitability segment as well. So, it's driving a lot of our increased profitability and leverage within our model. But those are the drivers. Outside of Airo, it is the bundling. It's the customers, customers coming in with intent, customers moving to that second product. We've talked about once we get to the second product, our average retention is 85%, but it goes up from there. If we get customers to a third product, it goes up significantly. It's almost a customer for life. So, those are the things that are driving the momentum in A&C right now, and we're seeing that compounding. So, I would say between price, demand, attach, everything is driving that nice growth in there. On the share of purchases, there's been no change. We'll talk about it a little more on Investor Day, a little more broadly, but it's still a big part of our portfolio to return capital to our shareholders. We have 1.4 left on our authorization. We'll look at it in our discipline framework, quarter to quarter, based on what we see out there, and we'll make decisions as we go. We will talk about it a little bit more when we get to the Investor Day in March. Thanks Matt. I would look at the overall business and the momentum we have going in. Remember, it's not just a subscription business. We have transactional and we have hardware shipments as well. So, we take that into account and we take into account the timing of those orders and when we think they're going out. So, there'll always be a little bit of a discrepancy between bookings and revenue related to that. Yeah. So, anything we plan on doing pricing wise, just so you know, is built into our guide as we sit here today. We're excited about the bundling and the attach that's happening within Airo, within our software platform all together. And with 21 million customers, 14 million interactions with them, we get a lot of data about how they're getting value out of our products, which creates a lot of opportunity going forward around pricing bundles, elasticity around that, seeing the value they're driving. So, we think there's a lot of opportunity out there as we go forward. But right now, we've built in pricing actions as we usually do within our guide for the rest of the year. And we'll continue to evaluate and update as we go forward. Yeah. Clarke, I would say it will be primarily the first half with some in the second half, but primarily in the first half. Yeah. Thanks Clarke. And the way I look at it is if you take where we're exiting at Q4 of 2023 and where we're going for Q4 of 2024, the things that you have to look at are, reduced T&D spend, right? We're leveraging more of the AWS cloud. We're reducing dependency on data centers. There'll be a natural leverage we'll get in our P&L related to that. We're getting leverage in our care organization through the use of AI and automation, also access to global workforces that'll help us as we go forward. And then some of it is just the natural growing A&C picture, right? It's a more profitable segment. It's software based. Therefore, as that grows and becomes a bigger part of the picture, it helps expand our margins just naturally again, that leverage we get from the 2+ products starts to kick in the bigger A&C gets all together. So those are kind of the levers I'm looking at. Hopefully that's helpful. Yeah. So I'll give some color for you, Ygal. When we look at our customers, we've always said we are targeting customers with a higher intent to do something when they come into the funnel, add that second product, start that business, generate value for themselves, and therefore generate value for us. What we've seen coming out of '23 and continuing into 2024 at the gross ads level is that consistent, strong demand that we've talked about all year and that continuing. And to put it in perspective, '23 gross customer ads was higher than 2022, right? And so not only are we seeing an increase there, we're seeing it more consistent from quarter to quarter and more stable.  With that, we're seeing that also that intentful customer come in with those gross ads, which is the momentum we're seeing in the bundling, the growth you see materialize in A&C. And we're seeing through the divestitures, we are losing customers, but they are generally customers that were low intent customers. So they were on a single product, maybe weren't doing things, hadn't done things for years. So that trade off is in there and continues to be something that we are working through on a net customer ad basis. Obviously, as we continue our divestitures and look at our portfolios, we've done a lot of that work in '23. So that will begin to abate for the work we've done in '23 and we'll continue to review our portfolio going forward. But it is bringing in the demand that has that higher intent customer and that stable demand we're seeing at the front of the funnel now. Yeah. And I'll just add, the GPV is what we focus on because that's what we monetize within our customer base and that's what we're targeting to help grow payments. Yeah. So, giving you color around, I'll say how we expect it to rollout. We talked about 27 in Q1 because of the spending related to our renewals and certain other timing and expenses. And then, 31 is our exit strategy with 29 being the average. So we do think -- we do, like we saw last year, believe it'll ladder up. We haven't gotten to the exact numbers yet. We'll provide more color around that as we get further into the year. But I think you can put a trajectory around there. Now, there might be some timing of marketing expenses that we'll talk you through if that were to happen. But other than that, I would expect it to be similar to what we saw this year in laddering up through the year. Yeah. Thanks Elizabeth. Just a little further color, we're seeing the momentum in A&C and we've talked about the bookings. We've talked about the headwinds related to some of the divestiture activity. There are other things we built in there for the acquired or non-strategic hosting assets that still exist that haven't been integrated. We're assuming they're flat to down for the year as we continue to evaluate their long-term prospects. Things like aftermarket, we're assuming will be flat for the year, maybe slightly up, but again, no momentum being grown there -- coming there from continued growth in that market. That could change. There's some volatility in that market quarter to quarter, but we think on a long-term basis, that'll be the way to measure it. Still good growth in domains. It's still something that we're big in growing at percentage point wise is always difficult on a big base, but we think it'll be a steady increase as we see that demand coming in. So, when you put that all up and you put the headwinds into there at the first part of the year, we think 6% is a good point for the middle of the range. We know there's opportunities for the high-end of the range and we'll continue to monitor those. I think Aman put it perfect. We balance the growth and the profitability. Our goal is to drive free cash flow and ultimately free cash flow per share. We're constantly looking at the ways to do that and the ways to be creative to the long-term model. And we'll constantly evaluate what creates that opportunity for us that we can go into the future. Yeah. So, we did a lot of work in 2023, and that caused 100 basis points headwinds, both in '23 and '24. We're still continuing to evaluate our portfolio and we'll take any actions that we need to related to things that may not be strategic or things that aren't going to be accretive long-term to our model. So I wouldn't say we're done. I would say we'll continue to optimize, evaluate and make the decisions for the long-term business best we can. Yeah. I haven't quantified it out to the exact numbers, but keep in mind it benefits us in two areas. One, obviously it helps on normalized EBITDA on a go forward basis, but also reduces our CapEx spend because a lot of these divestitures related to also data centers that we no longer need and will go with the acquiring entity. So, there are two benefits we see. Both triangulate around helping our free cash flow and generating our free cash flow growth going forward. Yeah. I don't know, Ella, if we've gotten into that detail before, so I'll give you some high level and then hopefully that's helpful for you. A&C in and of itself is a higher margin business for us. There are certain areas that are from a gross margin perspective a little lower, for example, payments where we have the transaction fee, but they're coupled with software and subscriptions that drive it up. So when we look at it from a bundling perspective, they are very accretive to the margin as well as the normalized EBITDA line. I would say when I look at what's driving the growth in A&C, you have to look at it from -- there is a pricing aspect of it, no doubt, as we increase prices across certain products, but there also is a demand element of it, which when we see that customer go to that second product, we get the increase on that as well. So I would say it's a good mix. We haven't gotten into breaking down X times Y, but all that's contributing to the growth in A&C right now."

And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating and business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.goddady.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished at the SEC. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise noted. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, November 2, 2023. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy centers on driving profitable growth, resulting in compounding free cash flow per share and long-term shareholder value. In recent years, we have proven our commitment through decisive actions and margin expansion even in slower growth conditions. Q3 was an important quarter for us. I am pleased with the results and the continued trajectory into Q4 and 2024. Third quarter normalized EBITDA margins jumped 250 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a reduction in tech and dev spend, some of which was expected and some realized a quarter early. While margin improvement is increasingly evident in our financial performance, this stems from our earlier restructuring, brand integration and diligent efforts for over a year to drive cloud adoption, which unlock additional savings. As shared earlier this year, we are executing these changes in a deliberate and strategic manner with a commitment to ongoing cost structure management. The work we have done and our ongoing initiatives position us for sustained margin expansion in future quarters and years to come. Q4 will also benefit from margin improvement primarily from a reduction in tech and dev spend. Additionally, we are eager to see our high-margin segment applications and commerce grow faster since in time, that becomes an additional tailwind to our overall margin. Applications and commerce bookings grew 12% in Q3, and we are encouraged by that momentum. October has continued that trajectory with mid-teens bookings growth in applications and commerce. One of the key messages that I hope you take away from our results and my comments today is that the third quarter marked the turning point of our tech and dev spend as a few significant platform improvements and brand integrations start to be in the rearview mirror, and our product investments get past their peak. As a result of these dynamics, we are well positioned to exit 2024 with normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31%, another significant step forward for our business. As we look at the next few years, we see leverage opportunities across the P&L. In care, leverage will be driven by consumer behavior, enhanced automation and the incorporation of generative AI. Within tech and dev, as already mentioned, we are actively pursuing opportunities for leverage with multiple initiatives. Furthermore, we remain committed to our disciplined approach in marketing and G&A. These strategies collectively chart a course for our continued margin expansion through 2025 and 2026, and we look forward to providing additional insights at our Investor Day early next year. As always, I want to take a few minutes and talk about our highest priority initiatives. We have added productivity explicitly to our priorities and changed the order. This was driven by the fast adoption of generative AI and new capabilities in bundling with domains and productivity, opening up new exciting opportunities. Elevating to our first priority, we have evolved innovation in domains to innovation in domains and productivity. We have enhanced the bundling capabilities for our productivity solutions which is already contributing to the faster growth in our applications and commerce segment, and we are taking it further. As you know, the integration of machine learning and use of AI is not new to GoDaddy. We have harnessed these technologies for several years, primarily in our care and marketing functions. Building upon this foundational expertise, we quickly became a leader in the generative AI space for our industry, with customer-facing capabilities in market since April. I am excited to showcase the first iteration of GoDaddy's digital guide now named GoDaddy Airo to you at our Investor Day later this month. As I had shared last quarter, this innovative experience empowers customers to access the full suite of GoDaddy products and additional partner products seamlessly just by acquiring a domain. In this experience, domain purchasers received an automatically generated basic website using generative AI and automatically generated logo, ready-to-use social post, personalized e-mail address and more, all delivered in an automated, low-friction manner. All of this is in service to making a significant improvement in the number of customers that have more than two products with us. As you are aware, customers with two plus products retain at much higher rates and have much higher lifetime value all the way to ADX for customers enabled. On driving commerce through presence, over the years, we have added elegant, functional, performant and fully featured capabilities at a fast pace to address the needs of our customers in a rapidly evolving and competitive environment. As a result, Google core web vitals recognizes GoDaddy's website builder built sites at the highest performing websites. This quarter, we have taken strides towards our vision in empowering our customers with even broader capabilities to help them grow their businesses with confidence. Our conversations feature has elevated the way our customers connect with their own customers, making it simpler and more effective than ever before. We are proud to announce that we are the first to integrate Google's business messages in the U.S. Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated M365 e-mail and social direct messages, mentions and comments into our conversation platform, creating a unified all-in-one solution that is second to none. With these advancements, GoDaddy's website plus marketing can continue to serve larger and larger customers that have more complex needs. We also continued to drive strong growth in our omni-commerce solution. Our partnership with Worldpay has launched, and these customers are already transacting using our hardware and software. Customers in our base continue to convert to GoDaddy Payments at an impressive rate and attaching to our base was, again, the strongest component of our year-over-year GPV growth, which remains on pace to more than double our last year's exit rate. On delivering for Pros, we mentioned last quarter that improvements in our Managed WordPress solution have reached an important milestone, driving improvement in retention rates as customers begin to recognize an enhanced solution. We now offer one of the industry's fastest, most secure and easiest to use Managed WordPress platforms. In a recent third-party performance benchmarking study sites hosted on GoDaddy's WordPress loaded an impressive 2x faster, which results in improved search engine rankings for our customers. Now one quarter later, we are proud to share that these efforts drove impressive double-digit growth in Managed WordPress bookings, which is included in our applications and commerce segment. Additionally, these features are now enhanced with generative AI features to help deliver simplified experiences that expand on the enhancements we have made around performance and security, giving GoDaddy a clear value-based advantage. In just minutes, our customers can now create beautiful, secure and high-performing WordPress sites. In closing, we are committed to driving a strong combination of revenue growth plus profitability. As Mark will detail, based on the margin expansion efforts in 2022 and 2023 and our confidence in our ability for continued margin expansion in 2024, we see the path to further enhance profitability in 2025 and 2026, above the 31% normalized EBITDA margins that we have laid out today. Our hallways radiate with the energy of tenure and new talent, and we have retrofitted many platforms and products at the company with new and exciting technologies. I am confident that our work has materially improved the fundamentals of the company, and the entire management team is determined to drive shareholder value. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. The product enhancements over the last few years have put GoDaddy at the forefront of one of our most exciting eras yet. And we are poised to deliver a complete integrated software solution to our customers spanning every facet of their needs. We have seen the positive traction from these efforts in terms of faster product attach, stable retention rates as well as the strong sustained double-digit growth of our applications and commerce revenue, which has also contributed to us expanding our normalized EBITDA margin ahead of schedule. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Applications and commerce grew 11% to $363 million, delivering at the high end of our guided range. Additionally, we delivered an expanded segment EBITDA margin of 42% from 41% last quarter. The related ARR for applications and commerce grew 11% to more than $1.4 billion. Create and grow ARR grew 9% to $478 million as bookings trended ahead of revenue growth. Like last quarter, GPV continues to grow at an impressive rate as our customers within our 21 million base convert to GoDaddy Payments. Core platform revenue totaled $706 million, flat year-over-year and in line with our guide. The segment's EBITDA margin accelerated to 30% from 27% last quarter. ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, flat year-over-year. Core platform revenue was supported by 4% growth in domains on stronger customer additions from higher demand and price increases. Additionally, domains bookings growth accelerated to 8%, showing a strong recovery for future revenue growth. This was partially offset by aftermarket, down slightly 2% to $107 million as it begins to reverse prior quarter trends, and the 150 basis points of headwind from migration and divestitures of certain assets previously mentioned. Total revenue grew to $1.07 billion, up 4% on a reported and constant currency basis and above the midpoint of our guide. Within total revenue, international revenue grew to $346 million, up 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. ARPU grew 2% to $200 on a trailing 12-month basis, and we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers despite the headwinds from our migration efforts. We are happy to share that the number of customers with two or more products now sits above 50%, and retention rates for the GoDaddy products remained at approximately 85%. Bookings totaled $1.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of aftermarket, the drivers of growth in bookings were strong customer additions and price increases in domains as well as strong attachment applications in commerce. We expect these factors to contribute to accelerated revenue and normalized EBITDA growth next year. Normalized EBITDA grew 13% to $296 million while delivering an expanded margin of 28%. These margin gains were driven in part by the two points of leverage achieved this quarter from a reduction in normalized tech and dev spend, decreasing 140 basis points sequentially as a percent of revenue. With that, we want to shed some further light on the components of tech and dev to give you an appreciation of the nature of the spend categories. There are two distinct categories of spending, one that drives product innovation and the other that supports our operations. First, we invest in driving innovation that enables our customers' success by providing competitive tools and interactions to enhance customer lifetime value through improved attach, retention and pricing. In the second category, we invest in our infrastructure to support our operations by maintaining, unifying and securing our technology platform, delivering a seamless experience for our 21 million customer. In addition, these investments facilitate a better cash profile by reducing data center-related capital expenditures, which improves our overall free cash flow and free cash flow per share. We also benefit from technologies we build in-house that are driving efficiencies in care and marketing spend. As a percentage of revenue, product innovation represents 7% to 8%, and infrastructure to run a secured company of our size represents 8% to 9%. Overall, during the third quarter, we reduced our tech and dev and capital spending by 5% from our restructuring efforts, the migration of noncore hosting assets and reduced data center capital expenditures. And to be clear, we know there is room to do more. We believe the strength of our product portfolio today has brought us to an inflection point, and we expect reduced tech and dev spending to meaningfully contribute to our EBITDA margin trajectory going forward without sacrificing GoDaddy's ability to innovate and compete. Moving on to our cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 8% to $320 million, and free cash flow grew to 6% to $280 million despite increased interest expense and the timing of working capital spend, which is expected to flip in Q4 of this year. Although our net debt has remained the same at $3.6 billion, our net cash interest expense for the quarter increased by 28% to $40 million, primarily from the refinance of our Term B loan. We finished Q3 with $329 million in cash, total liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we remain at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range of 2x to 4x. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.82 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.96, a 14% increase driven by improved operating leverage and share repurchases. Through October 31, we repurchased 17.3 million shares year-to-date, totaling $1.3 billion, of which $118 million was repurchased since the end of Q3. This brings the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorization to $2.6 billion and 34.2 million shares, achieving 20% reduced fully diluted shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q4 total revenue in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.115 billion, representing growth of 6% at the midpoint of our range. We expect our high-margin applications in commerce segment to deliver approximately 13% growth for Q4. In core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver in the range of 2% to 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Bookings growth is expected to outperform revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points in Q4. As Aman mentioned, all of us on the GoDaddy team have the same determination and resolve around the opportunities we see ahead. And we are poised to drive additional normalized EBITDA margin leverage through the end of this year and beyond. As a result, we are increasing our targets for Q4 normalized EBITDA margin to approximately 29%. Additionally, the full year normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve, delivering slightly above the 26% previously noted. As a reminder, from 2022, we delivered approximately three points of normalized EBITDA margin expansion. As evidenced by the incremental restructuring charge recognized this quarter, we remain committed to seeking out additional opportunities to drive efficiency throughout our operating model to achieve higher margins. We also remain on track to deliver our unlevered free cash flow, free cash flow and free cash flow per share target of $1.2 billion plus, $1 billion plus and $7.25 plus, respectively. In addition to our typical fourth quarter guidance, given the degree of focus on our ability to deliver margin expansion as we reaccelerate growth, we think it is important to update investors on our margin expectations for 2024. In 2024, we expect our tech and dev expenses to fall in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We also expect to continue to drive improvements through the next year, resulting in a normalized EBITDA margin in Q4 of 2024 of approximately 31%. Based on our confidence in GoDaddy's ability to accelerate the pace of margin expansion in 2024, we also plan to enhance profitability further in 2025 and 2026 as we continue the path above 31% normalized EBITDA margins that we have laid out today. We will provide more detail about our expectations for this at our Investor Day in the first quarter of next year. As always, we remain focused on executing on what is within our control. So while we continue to be excited about our product portfolio, our ability to drive durable revenue growth and our levers to drive margin expansion, we realized that we are still in a dynamic macro environment, and we want to be responsive to the feedback from investors. I want to be clear that as we've been doing for the last several years, we are committed to actively managing the business with the goal of delivering a strong combination of revenue growth plus profitability. We take a dynamic approach to managing the business, and we will be proactive in driving margin expansion over time and compounding free cash flow per share. Please note that we plan to provide complete 2024 financial guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in keeping with our normal practice. We believe enhancing profitability and durable top line growth will drive even stronger free cash flow generation. We will continue to deploy cash in line with our capital allocation framework, creating significant value for our shareholders. We are excited about our path ahead, and we are acting with urgency to drive results every day. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vikram, please go ahead.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Can you hear me okay?\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Vikram.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on the guidance. I think you previously talked about exiting the year at a 7% revenue growth rate. It looks like the fourth quarter guidance here points to about 6% at the midpoint. And I think you also lowered the top end of the full year revenue range by a little bit. And so curious if you can just talk about some of the factors that are driving those adjustments? And then as a follow-up to that, I think you previously talked about an accelerating growth rate into fiscal '24. I'm curious just given all the updates here. Is that still your expectation? And I know you don't want to formally guide to '24 at this point, but maybe if you can talk about some of the puts and takes we should be taking into consideration. And I'll leave it there.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Vikram. I'll start with, as we've done in prior quarters, we use a range, and that range takes into account the unpredictability of our aftermarket business. And we try to build that into our thought process as we go quarter-to-quarter. 7% is still part of the guided range. It allows for the upside or downside to our transactional business. When we're talking about the difference between these numbers, we are talking about a few million dollars either direction. And overall, on a $4 billion business, we feel good about the momentum it is driving. So hopefully, that gives a little bit of help on the first part of that question. On the second part of the question, we love our momentum going into 2024. If you look at our bookings growth and applications and commerce outpacing our revenue within the quarter. If you look at domains, 8% bookings growth versus 4% revenue coming out of the quarter and going into Q4. You look at the pricing actions, we take the overall growth of applications and commerce just as a bigger part of the picture. It really shows a lot of that momentum going forward. We have a lot of confidence in that, I would say, momentum going into 2024 and our ability to grow upon that. But we're feeling good about where we're headed.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Okay, thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. First, Mark, just sticking with that commentary around the domains booking growing 8%, nice acceleration there. Can you break down what the contribution there is from price versus actual growth in domains? And then, Aman, you mentioned getting some leverage in care over time from changing consumer behavior. What did you mean by that specifically? And then as part of the automation process that you see there, do you see opportunity to further reduce headcount either with -- in terms of in-house headcount or your contractor partners within care specifically?\nMark McCaffrey: All right. Thanks, Robert. And I'll start with the domains. And I would say both, right? We took pricing actions in Q3 that started to show up, especially in our bookings, but is accelerating our revenue, but we are seeing strong demand within domain. Now the strong demand also has a compounding effect because we're seeing them attached to that second product faster than we ever did, and that is showing up in our growth in bookings and applications and commerce right now. So I'd say it's a combination of all those working in the same direction, giving that momentum and giving us that confidence going into 2024.\nAman Bhutani: And on care, Trevor, over the last couple of years, we've done a good job of leveraging our care line item as revenue has grown. We've kept care pretty flat to down. When we look forward, I continue to see opportunities for automation, and the consumer behavior piece that's really important is that more and more consumers want to engage with care using chat or messaging. And that just is a lower cost interaction for us versus voice calls. We've also optimized how we connect with customers around the world, and that is continuing to be a tailwind for us because in our case, chat or messaging is running well ahead of voice. And that slowly starts to tip in favor of a lower and lower cost on the care side.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thank you both.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, there. This is actually Jian [ph] for Mark. Thanks for taking the question. So a couple of ones. First, on the margin guidance again for '24. You mentioned kind of kind of greater leverage from tech and dev. How should we -- I guess -- maybe first, like where is the additional leverage coming from? Like what are you cutting? And how should we think about maybe a steady-state tech and dev level? And then the second question is on -- I think you mentioned very quickly on accelerating revenue in '24 as well. If you kind of talk through the puts and takes on that. What should we think about -- like how much of that is from easy comps versus your confidence in organic growth? [Indiscernible].\nMark McCaffrey: Great. Thanks, Jian, and good talking to you. On the normalized EBITDA puts and takes. We're coming -- we started talking about this in the first half of the year, and we were taking actions around integrating some of our core GoDaddy platforms into one technology stack. We took some restructuring actions. We talked about how the benefit of those would start to show up in the second half of the year. We saw some of that accelerate into Q3 based on our, I would say, hitting the timetables and milestones around getting workloads into the cloud. So we can see that momentum continuing going the year, allowing us to drive a lot of efficiencies within our tech and dev. The other part of it is application of commerce. From a segment margin perspective, as that continues to grow at an accelerated pace, that provides us even more leverage into our normalized EBITDA margin. So we'll get to a little bit more of the puts and takes and run rate and what we think is normalized when we get into next year and talk in more detail around 2024. But that's a high-level good way to think about where we're going to continue to see them and our ability to drive that leverage in our normalized EBITDA margin.\nAman Bhutani: And then I think the second part of the question was around growth in 2024. And of course, there are some comps at play here, Jian. But the key piece that we're highlighting today is the growth in applications and commerce. And a couple of the data points, and I know our investors are interested in our path to growth in A&C. So we shared a couple of data points today in terms of the 12% bookings growth in Application & Commerce in Q3 and actually shared the data point for October as well with applications and commerce to mid-teens. And all of the components of applications and commerce -- and as you're probably aware, we have three core components, productivity, presence and commerce, and all of those are growing at healthy rates, which is what is pushing us into the teens there. And we expect that to continue into next year as well. Hello?\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey, great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the acceleration that you're seeing in your applications and commerce bookings. Maybe just some more details on what exactly is driving that because there are other businesses that serve SMBs that are seeing pressure with SMB spending, but it seems like you're seeing improvements. So trying to figure out what the disconnect is there? Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. So when we look at our customers and we survey our customers sort of every six months or so, what we noticed is that they're resilient group. And even though they may have sort of greater negativity about the overall economy, they are much more positive about their business and bringing everything to the table. And the way they look at our products, whether it's domains or websites or the productivity solutions, specifically e-mail, as sort of low-cost offerings that create a lot of value for them. So there's a lot of consumer surplus for them in the offerings that we bring to them. And the thing that's driving our sort of faster growth in applications is commerce. Number one, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we've unlocked some new bundling capabilities for both domains and productivity, and that's creating some new bundles, which are being accepted really well by customers. So we're super excited about that. And then in the presence bucket, I talked a little bit about our investments in Managed WordPress over the last couple of years, and that product has really come a long way and is now competitive with the best in the world. And we're seeing fast bookings growth on that double-digit bookings growth. And once we have the bookings in that, we know it's going to transition to revenue, and that's going to help accelerate Q4 and 2024 as well. And the third piece of application and commerce is commerce. And as Mark noted and I noted, GPV is still on track to double year-over-year. Our customers in our base are adopting that, and commerce continues to grow quite well. So you've got kind of all three parts of the segment really firing, and that's leading to the accelerating growth.\nMark McCaffrey: And I'll just add, the strong demand we're seeing really has been at a higher level than we've seen and consistent level. We've talked about it in prior quarters. We're continuing to see that same demand. And the customers are coming in with higher intent. So they're getting to that second product to get into their third product a lot quicker. So from a micro business perspective, we're seeing a lot of demand and attachment that is really pushing our model that we've talked about in the past.\nMatthew Pfau: Great, thank you. Appreciate for taking my questions.\nMark McCaffrey: No problem, thanks Matt.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question is from the line of Chris Kuntarich from UBS. Chris, please go ahead.\nChristopher Kuntarich: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, if I can. Just going back to that comment on 50% of customers now have two-plus products. I guess how should we be thinking about that versus last year and maybe versus kind of pre-COVID and really kind of how we should be thinking about where that goes in '24 and '25. Should we be thinking about more like that number jumping to 75%? Or is it more the idea that 50% of customers are going to three products? Just curious on kind of how that attach scales over time.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And thanks, Chris. Good question, right? We've never talked about that in the past. So it's the first time we're bringing that number out, and I don't want to go back because again, it's something we're tracking a little bit more closely now. But for us, when we get to that second product it really drives not only more efficiency within our operating model and drive our margins to a higher place. It really gets into strengthening our retention rates. It really gets into driving our ARPU. So there's a lot of metrics that are driven off that second attach, and even more, they get driven off those third attached. I always say, our average is around 85% retention. But when that customer gets to that second product, it goes up significantly higher from there. And if it gets to a third product, it's almost a customer for life, right? So it's really all about driving an LTV. We'll continue to provide guidance on that as we go forward as to how we're tracking towards them in a general basis, but it comes back to the what we're seeing now is not only strong demand but strong attach and more intent to do something with the domain name to the second product than we've seen before. And I know, Aman, you're excited about some of the bundling capabilities here, too.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, a couple of things I'd love to mention quickly is the first the bundling capabilities I talked about today. They're really going to help move the two-plus products number. And I think we've shared this number with you, and I think you're going to see it grow nicely. But the second thing, that's not the only thing we have in play. One of the great opportunities for GoDaddy is that we have a lot of customers coming through the domains funnel. And a lot of them aren't fully aware of the full suite of products that GoDaddy has. And that's where we're launching GoDaddy Airo, which is when a customer buys a domain name, they get a basic website created for them using gen AI and automation. They get a set of social posts that they can use right away. They get an AI-generated logo that they can use right away and actually a few other things that just come to them with the domain name. And one of the things we're most excited about launching this capability is that it will explore our domain customers to the full suite of offering that we have for them, and it will really propel two-plus products, which then leads to the numbers Mark is talking about, the higher LTV that comes with it. And that's obviously a path that we're pressing on pretty hard.\nChristopher Kuntarich: Got it. Very helpful. And maybe just one quick follow-up. I didn't see a GMV number in the release. Just curious. I think that's been growing two for the last two quarters. Just curious what that GMV number was and just kind of how you guys are seeing strength of overall consumer and SMB.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. The GMV number continues to grow and is about 36 billion right now. So I think it will be in our 10-K. It should be there.\nChristopher Kuntarich: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is John for Brent Thill. Thanks. Just wanted to go back at a higher level in terms of macro. Obviously, someone else has asked as well in terms of the small business and the consumer health. But just wanted to see what you're seeing there. I don't know if there's any notable trend throughout the quarter by month and what you're seeing so far this quarter? And then second, in the ARR growth numbers that you mentioned, create and grow was 9% [indiscernible] I'm wondering. Does that mean productivity or commerce maybe is growing noticeably faster? Just want to see what those components are? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes, John, let me take the first part. Mark can take the second. Based on our surveys, what we see for the micro businesses -- and I can give you two data points, one for the U.S. and one for the U.K. So you can get some idea of how it's different in different parts of the world. Generally, the question of how positive are they about growing their own business is this year a little bit up to flattish, right? They feel optimistic -- I think part of it is they have to feel optimistic. They have to show up every day and make it happen. So they have that positivity about themselves and their businesses. But if we look year-over-year on how they feel about the broader economy, that has gone down. So just to summarize in the U.S., positive on the overall economy, but almost equally positive, if not a bit higher on their own business. And it's a little bit different in the U.K. where the overall number for positivity is a bit lower. And even though they continue to be positive about their business, their view of the economy has declined much faster. So there's some consistency across the markets, but the numbers are different with the U.S. micro business owners feeling generally more positive about their business than the U.K., for example. Hopefully, that make it a bit of color, John and it's helpful. And I'll turn it to Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes, thanks. And I think when you look at the difference between the create and grow ARR and the overall ARR, the subscription business is productivity. So it doesn't take much of a, I would say, a lead to say, yes, it is growing at a good pace on an ARR basis and adding to our subscription.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, hi Naved.\nNaved Khan: So just on your last answer, Mark, on the sort of the 9% growth in create and grow. I'm wondering how fast website plus marketing is growing in terms of ARR. Any color or commentary there? And then, Aman, maybe you can give us some color on payable domains, how that grew in the quarter and your thoughts there?\nMark McCaffrey: We don't break it down by product specifically, but I will add color to say we're seeing strength across the board in not only create and grow but applications and commerce. So I would say we're really happy with the attach, the momentum in the market. The A&C bookings are really outpacing revenue at this point. So I would say strength across the board.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. And on payable domain, we continued to perform and contribute to the GPV growth that we're seeing, but in line sort of with what we've seen in the past. Q3 overall was a stronger quarter for GPV. And as we look forward to Q4, we're excited to see what's to come.\nNaved Khan: Thank you guys.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Naved.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ella Smith from JPMorgan. Ella, please go ahead.\nElla Smith: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Aman and Mark, could you please update us on the hosting business? If domains were up 4% in the quarter, does that imply that hosting was down high single digits in the quarter?\nMark McCaffrey: We're seeing about 150 basis points of headwind related to the hosting business and the divestitures and the migration. Aftermarket is also included in the core platform number, just to keep in mind. While we're going to have some headwinds related to some of those actions we took in the first half of the year, we're seeing the core GoDaddy hosting platform stable, right? We're seeing high retention rates. We're seeing a lot of cash flow generation. We're even seeing that the few little churn that we have within the core GoDaddy hosting stack is going to other areas of our platform right now and attaching products. So I would say we're continuing to work through the integration, divestitures, the compares around it. We'll have some headwinds moving into next year related to that part of it, but we're happy with GoDaddy's core hosting strength right now being stable and primarily close to flat.\nElla Smith: Got it. Makes sense. And for my follow-up, I think Aman just said that GMV was 38 billion in the quarter. What about GPV? And I was hoping you can remind us around your strategy to refer customers to GoDaddy Payments.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I had said 36 billion. And GPV is on track, very similar to last quarter to double year-over-year. There's no change in sort of the trajectory there. Like I just noted, it was actually a strong quarter for GPV, and we're looking forward to Q4. In terms of attaching GoDaddy Payments to our base, new -- or let me handle both new customers coming in, for example, the websites plus marketing attaching GoDaddy Payments at very, very high rates and us attaching to the base has continued to grow. And the biggest contributor to the GPV growth continues to be us converting existing GoDaddy customers to GoDaddy Omnicommerce solution.\nElla Smith: Great. Thank you so much.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Ella.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Ella.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, good afternoon guys. First question, so you've had an activist investor get a little bit more active and vocal about their views and just want to maybe get -- give you an opportunity to respond or make any comments on that or anything you'd like to share. And then second, you mentioned strength in domains, including pricing. So is that on the pricing front? Is it raising the annual price for domain registrations? And with the strength you're seeing in domains, relative to what we're seeing in terms of dot-com and dot-net growth, which has been challenged and kind of flat, what are you seeing? What are the differences? Is it growth in different TLDs? Is it more -- especially the ones that you hold at your registry business, too? Maybe just a little bit of insight on what you're seeing in the domain world.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Ygal. We talk to our investors regularly, and what we learned is that they're looking for more information from us in a couple of areas. They're looking for our plan to drive further margin expansion, and they're looking for our path to faster growth in A&C. And what you saw in our prepared comments today is that we shared more details on both of those areas. We as a team are focused on the results we're delivering, and all of our forward commentary is everything that we're doing to drive value for shareholders. So our broader view is that we listen to a lot of -- we're engaged with our investors all the time. We're listening to them, and we're sharing back information on the things that we feel they're asking us for. And then on the domain side, I'll turn it to Mark, but just to quickly remind you, although we don't break out dot-com, dot-net or any specific TLD, our registry business continues to do well. It's continued to sort of perform at a great rate. And we do offer, as you know, a very large number, TLDs over 400. So our business, our base is different. And also our reach internationally is significantly different than many other players. But I'll turn it to Mark to see what he'd add.\nMark McCaffrey: I think that covered a lot of it, Aman. I would say we're seeing strength in the demand end of it. We're seeing -- we took pricing action. No doubt that's contributing to the overall 8% bookings growth that we're seeing in domains coming out of the quarter. So a lot of strength there. We're a little different than some of the other players. So we have a little bit more breadth of what we offer, and we're seeing strength in some TLDs. And probably our geographic regions, as others have pointed out, there are weaknesses in certain areas that we're just not as exposed to.\nYgal Arounian: Great, thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Ken, please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nMark McCaffrey: We can.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to maybe check in if you guys can give an update on what you're seeing in the aftermarket. What are the dynamics that played out in the quarter? And how we're thinking about that trend in Q4?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. So we tried to add a little more color around the aftermarket and our stated comments this time. We continue to be the global leader in the aftermarket, and it's driving part of a healthy domain business overall. It's a $400 million-plus business, and we're seeing it grow at a lesser rate than we've seen before. Now Q3 was still a relatively tough compare to last year for us in that. So we've seen less of a dip. We see that trend starting to turn like we talked about. We expect Q4 to be an easier compare. And obviously, we expect going into 2024, those comparisons get broadly more easy. But from a volume perspective, overall, we're still seeing a healthy $400 million-plus business on an annual basis. We continue to see the momentum. Like we stated earlier, in the year, we're not seeing the large transactions like we used to, but we continue to see on a volume basis aftermarket being healthy.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the kind of spend management, I think definitely positive development, see some focus there. I guess what's the -- what areas are you looking to potentially peel back on from R&D? Any concerns that, that might potentially hurt product innovation?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks for that question. When we look at our tech and debt spend, the way we have it allocated is the -- it's divided between the platform investments and our product innovation. On the platform side, there is a set of investment made, which Mark shared with some slides around cyber, around core data platform improvements, and those have tended to help all our products. And what we found there is as we integrate more and more platforms, as we've integrated the brands that we talked about this year, some of those costs peak and it started to come down. So we're seeing leverage on the platform side, and that's great. On the product innovation side, our approach has very much been about attacking a few areas and driving improvement in them. And as those areas improve, shifting our spend into other areas -- or our investment, I should say, into other areas and improving them. And we're very careful about how those investments. And as an example, we invested -- and I talked about the investment in Managed WordPress over a couple of years. And I'm very happy to have a great product today that is now showing great growth as well. But that does mean that we have team and a size of investment there that we no longer need to continue to invest in it. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color on how we go about sort of getting leverage on the whole on the platform side but also on the core product side, where we are able to move people around and get to things and sort of drive growth without necessarily always adding more.\nKen Wong: Got it. Appreciate the insights. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Deepak, please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask about the headwinds from the hosting business, from all the divestitures and some of the other moving pieces. When should we expect some of this to normalize? And what do you generally think kind of the long-term growth outlook for these businesses? And then sort of I wanted to follow-up on the answer for the question below. How much is the margin expansion targets for potentially '24 and then '25 and '26 and beyond? Sort of dependent on the top line growth. Are there any specific ranges that you can kind of give us to expect on the top line side to achieve this margin targets? Thanks so much.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Deepak. I'll start with the divestitures and the headwinds related to it. A lot of those activities we've completed in the first half of the year. So it will be a little bit of time before the comparables around them start to normalize. They will take to the second half of next year. So it will create a little bit of a headwind going into the year for us. We do have some of those activities still happening in the second half of the year. So it will continue to be something we will point out, call out and talk about the impact. That's why we called out the 150 basis point headwinds related to that going forward. From a stabilization point of view, once we get through the actions that we've taken when you look at the core GoDaddy platform in and of itself, we think this is going to be a low single digit to flat growing business over time. It's got huge high retention rates compared to our normal business, generates a lot of cash flow. And we're seeing them convert over to other areas of the GoDaddy platform when they leave. So they're staying within the technology stack, which is great for us. But we're not looking at that as driving any significant growth in our core platform going forward. So hopefully, that's helpful. On the margin expansion, our model doesn't require double-digit growth going forward. We acknowledge we're living in a dynamic environment and the headwinds in their sales wins are continuing to present themselves. But if you look at the momentum around our A&C business in and of itself, its ability to generate higher normalized EBITDA becoming a bigger part of the picture as we move forward. If you look at our demand, our retention rates, our APRU all of those are pointing to more efficient and our ability to drive that operating margin. That's why we're comfortable and confident about the 31% exit rate and being approximately there when we exit next year. That's why we're confident in saying we're going to grow from there going into '25 and '26 as well. So again, takeaway, not premised on double-digit growth and is looking to continue to expand as we get away from the actions we've taken. We grow A&C. We're on the same technology stack now. And we're seeing the momentum in the business that we think is really going to drive profitable growth moving forward.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. And just very quickly, I did mention in my prepared remarks some of the areas where we have initiatives to continue to drive more efficiency in the line items, and I want to repeat them again, but we did share some items there. And ultimately, it drives a better combination of growth and profitability.\nChristie Masoner: Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I'll turn it back over to Aman for some closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie, and thank you for joining us. As always, just a quick mention to all the GoDaddy employees who have been working super hard and a great quarter for us. And I'm excited looking forward into Q4 and 2024. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy centers on driving profitable growth, resulting in compounding free cash flow per share and long-term shareholder value. In recent years, we have proven our commitment through decisive actions and margin expansion even in slower growth conditions. Q3 was an important quarter for us. I am pleased with the results and the continued trajectory into Q4 and 2024. Third quarter normalized EBITDA margins jumped 250 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a reduction in tech and dev spend, some of which was expected and some realized a quarter early. While margin improvement is increasingly evident in our financial performance, this stems from our earlier restructuring, brand integration and diligent efforts for over a year to drive cloud adoption, which unlock additional savings. As shared earlier this year, we are executing these changes in a deliberate and strategic manner with a commitment to ongoing cost structure management. The work we have done and our ongoing initiatives position us for sustained margin expansion in future quarters and years to come. Q4 will also benefit from margin improvement primarily from a reduction in tech and dev spend. Additionally, we are eager to see our high-margin segment applications and commerce grow faster since in time, that becomes an additional tailwind to our overall margin. Applications and commerce bookings grew 12% in Q3, and we are encouraged by that momentum. October has continued that trajectory with mid-teens bookings growth in applications and commerce. One of the key messages that I hope you take away from our results and my comments today is that the third quarter marked the turning point of our tech and dev spend as a few significant platform improvements and brand integrations start to be in the rearview mirror, and our product investments get past their peak. As a result of these dynamics, we are well positioned to exit 2024 with normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31%, another significant step forward for our business. As we look at the next few years, we see leverage opportunities across the P&L. In care, leverage will be driven by consumer behavior, enhanced automation and the incorporation of generative AI. Within tech and dev, as already mentioned, we are actively pursuing opportunities for leverage with multiple initiatives. Furthermore, we remain committed to our disciplined approach in marketing and G&A. These strategies collectively chart a course for our continued margin expansion through 2025 and 2026, and we look forward to providing additional insights at our Investor Day early next year. As always, I want to take a few minutes and talk about our highest priority initiatives. We have added productivity explicitly to our priorities and changed the order. This was driven by the fast adoption of generative AI and new capabilities in bundling with domains and productivity, opening up new exciting opportunities. Elevating to our first priority, we have evolved innovation in domains to innovation in domains and productivity. We have enhanced the bundling capabilities for our productivity solutions which is already contributing to the faster growth in our applications and commerce segment, and we are taking it further. As you know, the integration of machine learning and use of AI is not new to GoDaddy. We have harnessed these technologies for several years, primarily in our care and marketing functions. Building upon this foundational expertise, we quickly became a leader in the generative AI space for our industry, with customer-facing capabilities in market since April. I am excited to showcase the first iteration of GoDaddy's digital guide now named GoDaddy Airo to you at our Investor Day later this month. As I had shared last quarter, this innovative experience empowers customers to access the full suite of GoDaddy products and additional partner products seamlessly just by acquiring a domain. In this experience, domain purchasers received an automatically generated basic website using generative AI and automatically generated logo, ready-to-use social post, personalized e-mail address and more, all delivered in an automated, low-friction manner. All of this is in service to making a significant improvement in the number of customers that have more than two products with us. As you are aware, customers with two plus products retain at much higher rates and have much higher lifetime value all the way to ADX for customers enabled. On driving commerce through presence, over the years, we have added elegant, functional, performant and fully featured capabilities at a fast pace to address the needs of our customers in a rapidly evolving and competitive environment. As a result, Google core web vitals recognizes GoDaddy's website builder built sites at the highest performing websites. This quarter, we have taken strides towards our vision in empowering our customers with even broader capabilities to help them grow their businesses with confidence. Our conversations feature has elevated the way our customers connect with their own customers, making it simpler and more effective than ever before. We are proud to announce that we are the first to integrate Google's business messages in the U.S. Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated M365 e-mail and social direct messages, mentions and comments into our conversation platform, creating a unified all-in-one solution that is second to none. With these advancements, GoDaddy's website plus marketing can continue to serve larger and larger customers that have more complex needs. We also continued to drive strong growth in our omni-commerce solution. Our partnership with Worldpay has launched, and these customers are already transacting using our hardware and software. Customers in our base continue to convert to GoDaddy Payments at an impressive rate and attaching to our base was, again, the strongest component of our year-over-year GPV growth, which remains on pace to more than double our last year's exit rate. On delivering for Pros, we mentioned last quarter that improvements in our Managed WordPress solution have reached an important milestone, driving improvement in retention rates as customers begin to recognize an enhanced solution. We now offer one of the industry's fastest, most secure and easiest to use Managed WordPress platforms. In a recent third-party performance benchmarking study sites hosted on GoDaddy's WordPress loaded an impressive 2x faster, which results in improved search engine rankings for our customers. Now one quarter later, we are proud to share that these efforts drove impressive double-digit growth in Managed WordPress bookings, which is included in our applications and commerce segment. Additionally, these features are now enhanced with generative AI features to help deliver simplified experiences that expand on the enhancements we have made around performance and security, giving GoDaddy a clear value-based advantage. In just minutes, our customers can now create beautiful, secure and high-performing WordPress sites. In closing, we are committed to driving a strong combination of revenue growth plus profitability. As Mark will detail, based on the margin expansion efforts in 2022 and 2023 and our confidence in our ability for continued margin expansion in 2024, we see the path to further enhance profitability in 2025 and 2026, above the 31% normalized EBITDA margins that we have laid out today. Our hallways radiate with the energy of tenure and new talent, and we have retrofitted many platforms and products at the company with new and exciting technologies. I am confident that our work has materially improved the fundamentals of the company, and the entire management team is determined to drive shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. Hey, Vikram. And on care, Trevor, over the last couple of years, we've done a good job of leveraging our care line item as revenue has grown. We've kept care pretty flat to down. When we look forward, I continue to see opportunities for automation, and the consumer behavior piece that's really important is that more and more consumers want to engage with care using chat or messaging. And that just is a lower cost interaction for us versus voice calls. We've also optimized how we connect with customers around the world, and that is continuing to be a tailwind for us because in our case, chat or messaging is running well ahead of voice. And that slowly starts to tip in favor of a lower and lower cost on the care side. And then I think the second part of the question was around growth in 2024. And of course, there are some comps at play here, Jian. But the key piece that we're highlighting today is the growth in applications and commerce. And a couple of the data points, and I know our investors are interested in our path to growth in A&C. So we shared a couple of data points today in terms of the 12% bookings growth in Application & Commerce in Q3 and actually shared the data point for October as well with applications and commerce to mid-teens. And all of the components of applications and commerce -- and as you're probably aware, we have three core components, productivity, presence and commerce, and all of those are growing at healthy rates, which is what is pushing us into the teens there. And we expect that to continue into next year as well. Hello? Yes. So when we look at our customers and we survey our customers sort of every six months or so, what we noticed is that they're resilient group. And even though they may have sort of greater negativity about the overall economy, they are much more positive about their business and bringing everything to the table. And the way they look at our products, whether it's domains or websites or the productivity solutions, specifically e-mail, as sort of low-cost offerings that create a lot of value for them. So there's a lot of consumer surplus for them in the offerings that we bring to them. And the thing that's driving our sort of faster growth in applications is commerce. Number one, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we've unlocked some new bundling capabilities for both domains and productivity, and that's creating some new bundles, which are being accepted really well by customers. So we're super excited about that. And then in the presence bucket, I talked a little bit about our investments in Managed WordPress over the last couple of years, and that product has really come a long way and is now competitive with the best in the world. And we're seeing fast bookings growth on that double-digit bookings growth. And once we have the bookings in that, we know it's going to transition to revenue, and that's going to help accelerate Q4 and 2024 as well. And the third piece of application and commerce is commerce. And as Mark noted and I noted, GPV is still on track to double year-over-year. Our customers in our base are adopting that, and commerce continues to grow quite well. So you've got kind of all three parts of the segment really firing, and that's leading to the accelerating growth. Yes, a couple of things I'd love to mention quickly is the first the bundling capabilities I talked about today. They're really going to help move the two-plus products number. And I think we've shared this number with you, and I think you're going to see it grow nicely. But the second thing, that's not the only thing we have in play. One of the great opportunities for GoDaddy is that we have a lot of customers coming through the domains funnel. And a lot of them aren't fully aware of the full suite of products that GoDaddy has. And that's where we're launching GoDaddy Airo, which is when a customer buys a domain name, they get a basic website created for them using gen AI and automation. They get a set of social posts that they can use right away. They get an AI-generated logo that they can use right away and actually a few other things that just come to them with the domain name. And one of the things we're most excited about launching this capability is that it will explore our domain customers to the full suite of offering that we have for them, and it will really propel two-plus products, which then leads to the numbers Mark is talking about, the higher LTV that comes with it. And that's obviously a path that we're pressing on pretty hard. Yes. The GMV number continues to grow and is about 36 billion right now. So I think it will be in our 10-K. It should be there. Yes, John, let me take the first part. Mark can take the second. Based on our surveys, what we see for the micro businesses -- and I can give you two data points, one for the U.S. and one for the U.K. So you can get some idea of how it's different in different parts of the world. Generally, the question of how positive are they about growing their own business is this year a little bit up to flattish, right? They feel optimistic -- I think part of it is they have to feel optimistic. They have to show up every day and make it happen. So they have that positivity about themselves and their businesses. But if we look year-over-year on how they feel about the broader economy, that has gone down. So just to summarize in the U.S., positive on the overall economy, but almost equally positive, if not a bit higher on their own business. And it's a little bit different in the U.K. where the overall number for positivity is a bit lower. And even though they continue to be positive about their business, their view of the economy has declined much faster. So there's some consistency across the markets, but the numbers are different with the U.S. micro business owners feeling generally more positive about their business than the U.K., for example. Hopefully, that make it a bit of color, John and it's helpful. And I'll turn it to Mark. Yes, hi Naved. Yes. And on payable domain, we continued to perform and contribute to the GPV growth that we're seeing, but in line sort of with what we've seen in the past. Q3 overall was a stronger quarter for GPV. And as we look forward to Q4, we're excited to see what's to come. Thank you, Naved. Yes. I had said 36 billion. And GPV is on track, very similar to last quarter to double year-over-year. There's no change in sort of the trajectory there. Like I just noted, it was actually a strong quarter for GPV, and we're looking forward to Q4. In terms of attaching GoDaddy Payments to our base, new -- or let me handle both new customers coming in, for example, the websites plus marketing attaching GoDaddy Payments at very, very high rates and us attaching to the base has continued to grow. And the biggest contributor to the GPV growth continues to be us converting existing GoDaddy customers to GoDaddy Omnicommerce solution. Thanks, Ella. Thanks, Ygal. We talk to our investors regularly, and what we learned is that they're looking for more information from us in a couple of areas. They're looking for our plan to drive further margin expansion, and they're looking for our path to faster growth in A&C.

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. The product enhancements over the last few years have put GoDaddy at the forefront of one of our most exciting eras yet. And we are poised to deliver a complete integrated software solution to our customers spanning every facet of their needs. We have seen the positive traction from these efforts in terms of faster product attach, stable retention rates as well as the strong sustained double-digit growth of our applications and commerce revenue, which has also contributed to us expanding our normalized EBITDA margin ahead of schedule. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Applications and commerce grew 11% to $363 million, delivering at the high end of our guided range. Additionally, we delivered an expanded segment EBITDA margin of 42% from 41% last quarter. The related ARR for applications and commerce grew 11% to more than $1.4 billion. Create and grow ARR grew 9% to $478 million as bookings trended ahead of revenue growth. Like last quarter, GPV continues to grow at an impressive rate as our customers within our 21 million base convert to GoDaddy Payments. Core platform revenue totaled $706 million, flat year-over-year and in line with our guide. The segment's EBITDA margin accelerated to 30% from 27% last quarter. ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, flat year-over-year. Core platform revenue was supported by 4% growth in domains on stronger customer additions from higher demand and price increases. Additionally, domains bookings growth accelerated to 8%, showing a strong recovery for future revenue growth. This was partially offset by aftermarket, down slightly 2% to $107 million as it begins to reverse prior quarter trends, and the 150 basis points of headwind from migration and divestitures of certain assets previously mentioned. Total revenue grew to $1.07 billion, up 4% on a reported and constant currency basis and above the midpoint of our guide. Within total revenue, international revenue grew to $346 million, up 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. ARPU grew 2% to $200 on a trailing 12-month basis, and we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers despite the headwinds from our migration efforts. We are happy to share that the number of customers with two or more products now sits above 50%, and retention rates for the GoDaddy products remained at approximately 85%. Bookings totaled $1.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of aftermarket, the drivers of growth in bookings were strong customer additions and price increases in domains as well as strong attachment applications in commerce. We expect these factors to contribute to accelerated revenue and normalized EBITDA growth next year. Normalized EBITDA grew 13% to $296 million while delivering an expanded margin of 28%. These margin gains were driven in part by the two points of leverage achieved this quarter from a reduction in normalized tech and dev spend, decreasing 140 basis points sequentially as a percent of revenue. With that, we want to shed some further light on the components of tech and dev to give you an appreciation of the nature of the spend categories. There are two distinct categories of spending, one that drives product innovation and the other that supports our operations. First, we invest in driving innovation that enables our customers' success by providing competitive tools and interactions to enhance customer lifetime value through improved attach, retention and pricing. In the second category, we invest in our infrastructure to support our operations by maintaining, unifying and securing our technology platform, delivering a seamless experience for our 21 million customer. In addition, these investments facilitate a better cash profile by reducing data center-related capital expenditures, which improves our overall free cash flow and free cash flow per share. We also benefit from technologies we build in-house that are driving efficiencies in care and marketing spend. As a percentage of revenue, product innovation represents 7% to 8%, and infrastructure to run a secured company of our size represents 8% to 9%. Overall, during the third quarter, we reduced our tech and dev and capital spending by 5% from our restructuring efforts, the migration of noncore hosting assets and reduced data center capital expenditures. And to be clear, we know there is room to do more. We believe the strength of our product portfolio today has brought us to an inflection point, and we expect reduced tech and dev spending to meaningfully contribute to our EBITDA margin trajectory going forward without sacrificing GoDaddy's ability to innovate and compete. Moving on to our cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 8% to $320 million, and free cash flow grew to 6% to $280 million despite increased interest expense and the timing of working capital spend, which is expected to flip in Q4 of this year. Although our net debt has remained the same at $3.6 billion, our net cash interest expense for the quarter increased by 28% to $40 million, primarily from the refinance of our Term B loan. We finished Q3 with $329 million in cash, total liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we remain at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range of 2x to 4x. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.82 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.96, a 14% increase driven by improved operating leverage and share repurchases. Through October 31, we repurchased 17.3 million shares year-to-date, totaling $1.3 billion, of which $118 million was repurchased since the end of Q3. This brings the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorization to $2.6 billion and 34.2 million shares, achieving 20% reduced fully diluted shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q4 total revenue in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.115 billion, representing growth of 6% at the midpoint of our range. We expect our high-margin applications in commerce segment to deliver approximately 13% growth for Q4. In core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver in the range of 2% to 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Bookings growth is expected to outperform revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points in Q4. As Aman mentioned, all of us on the GoDaddy team have the same determination and resolve around the opportunities we see ahead. And we are poised to drive additional normalized EBITDA margin leverage through the end of this year and beyond. As a result, we are increasing our targets for Q4 normalized EBITDA margin to approximately 29%. Additionally, the full year normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve, delivering slightly above the 26% previously noted. As a reminder, from 2022, we delivered approximately three points of normalized EBITDA margin expansion. As evidenced by the incremental restructuring charge recognized this quarter, we remain committed to seeking out additional opportunities to drive efficiency throughout our operating model to achieve higher margins. We also remain on track to deliver our unlevered free cash flow, free cash flow and free cash flow per share target of $1.2 billion plus, $1 billion plus and $7.25 plus, respectively. In addition to our typical fourth quarter guidance, given the degree of focus on our ability to deliver margin expansion as we reaccelerate growth, we think it is important to update investors on our margin expectations for 2024. In 2024, we expect our tech and dev expenses to fall in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We also expect to continue to drive improvements through the next year, resulting in a normalized EBITDA margin in Q4 of 2024 of approximately 31%. Based on our confidence in GoDaddy's ability to accelerate the pace of margin expansion in 2024, we also plan to enhance profitability further in 2025 and 2026 as we continue the path above 31% normalized EBITDA margins that we have laid out today. We will provide more detail about our expectations for this at our Investor Day in the first quarter of next year. As always, we remain focused on executing on what is within our control. So while we continue to be excited about our product portfolio, our ability to drive durable revenue growth and our levers to drive margin expansion, we realized that we are still in a dynamic macro environment, and we want to be responsive to the feedback from investors. I want to be clear that as we've been doing for the last several years, we are committed to actively managing the business with the goal of delivering a strong combination of revenue growth plus profitability. We take a dynamic approach to managing the business, and we will be proactive in driving margin expansion over time and compounding free cash flow per share. Please note that we plan to provide complete 2024 financial guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in keeping with our normal practice. We believe enhancing profitability and durable top line growth will drive even stronger free cash flow generation. We will continue to deploy cash in line with our capital allocation framework, creating significant value for our shareholders. We are excited about our path ahead, and we are acting with urgency to drive results every day. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open the call for questions. Yes. Thanks, Vikram. I'll start with, as we've done in prior quarters, we use a range, and that range takes into account the unpredictability of our aftermarket business. And we try to build that into our thought process as we go quarter-to-quarter. 7% is still part of the guided range. It allows for the upside or downside to our transactional business. When we're talking about the difference between these numbers, we are talking about a few million dollars either direction. And overall, on a $4 billion business, we feel good about the momentum it is driving. So hopefully, that gives a little bit of help on the first part of that question. On the second part of the question, we love our momentum going into 2024. If you look at our bookings growth and applications and commerce outpacing our revenue within the quarter. If you look at domains, 8% bookings growth versus 4% revenue coming out of the quarter and going into Q4. You look at the pricing actions, we take the overall growth of applications and commerce just as a bigger part of the picture. It really shows a lot of that momentum going forward. We have a lot of confidence in that, I would say, momentum going into 2024 and our ability to grow upon that. But we're feeling good about where we're headed. All right. Thanks, Robert. And I'll start with the domains. And I would say both, right? We took pricing actions in Q3 that started to show up, especially in our bookings, but is accelerating our revenue, but we are seeing strong demand within domain. Now the strong demand also has a compounding effect because we're seeing them attached to that second product faster than we ever did, and that is showing up in our growth in bookings and applications and commerce right now. So I'd say it's a combination of all those working in the same direction, giving that momentum and giving us that confidence going into 2024. Great. Thanks, Jian, and good talking to you. On the normalized EBITDA puts and takes. We're coming -- we started talking about this in the first half of the year, and we were taking actions around integrating some of our core GoDaddy platforms into one technology stack. We took some restructuring actions. We talked about how the benefit of those would start to show up in the second half of the year. We saw some of that accelerate into Q3 based on our, I would say, hitting the timetables and milestones around getting workloads into the cloud. So we can see that momentum continuing going the year, allowing us to drive a lot of efficiencies within our tech and dev. The other part of it is application of commerce. From a segment margin perspective, as that continues to grow at an accelerated pace, that provides us even more leverage into our normalized EBITDA margin. So we'll get to a little bit more of the puts and takes and run rate and what we think is normalized when we get into next year and talk in more detail around 2024. But that's a high-level good way to think about where we're going to continue to see them and our ability to drive that leverage in our normalized EBITDA margin. And I'll just add, the strong demand we're seeing really has been at a higher level than we've seen and consistent level. We've talked about it in prior quarters. We're continuing to see that same demand. And the customers are coming in with higher intent. So they're getting to that second product to get into their third product a lot quicker. So from a micro business perspective, we're seeing a lot of demand and attachment that is really pushing our model that we've talked about in the past. No problem, thanks Matt. Yes. And thanks, Chris. Good question, right? We've never talked about that in the past. So it's the first time we're bringing that number out, and I don't want to go back because again, it's something we're tracking a little bit more closely now. But for us, when we get to that second product it really drives not only more efficiency within our operating model and drive our margins to a higher place. It really gets into strengthening our retention rates. It really gets into driving our ARPU. So there's a lot of metrics that are driven off that second attach, and even more, they get driven off those third attached. I always say, our average is around 85% retention. But when that customer gets to that second product, it goes up significantly higher from there. And if it gets to a third product, it's almost a customer for life, right? So it's really all about driving an LTV. We'll continue to provide guidance on that as we go forward as to how we're tracking towards them in a general basis, but it comes back to the what we're seeing now is not only strong demand but strong attach and more intent to do something with the domain name to the second product than we've seen before. And I know, Aman, you're excited about some of the bundling capabilities here, too. Yes, thanks. And I think when you look at the difference between the create and grow ARR and the overall ARR, the subscription business is productivity. So it doesn't take much of a, I would say, a lead to say, yes, it is growing at a good pace on an ARR basis and adding to our subscription. We don't break it down by product specifically, but I will add color to say we're seeing strength across the board in not only create and grow but applications and commerce. So I would say we're really happy with the attach, the momentum in the market. The A&C bookings are really outpacing revenue at this point. So I would say strength across the board. We're seeing about 150 basis points of headwind related to the hosting business and the divestitures and the migration. Aftermarket is also included in the core platform number, just to keep in mind. While we're going to have some headwinds related to some of those actions we took in the first half of the year, we're seeing the core GoDaddy hosting platform stable, right? We're seeing high retention rates. We're seeing a lot of cash flow generation. We're even seeing that the few little churn that we have within the core GoDaddy hosting stack is going to other areas of our platform right now and attaching products. So I would say we're continuing to work through the integration, divestitures, the compares around it. We'll have some headwinds moving into next year related to that part of it, but we're happy with GoDaddy's core hosting strength right now being stable and primarily close to flat. Thanks, Ella. I think that covered a lot of it, Aman. I would say we're seeing strength in the demand end of it. We're seeing -- we took pricing action. No doubt that's contributing to the overall 8% bookings growth that we're seeing in domains coming out of the quarter. So a lot of strength there. We're a little different than some of the other players. So we have a little bit more breadth of what we offer, and we're seeing strength in some TLDs. And probably our geographic regions, as others have pointed out, there are weaknesses in certain areas that we're just not as exposed to. We can. Yes. So we tried to add a little more color around the aftermarket and our stated comments this time. We continue to be the global leader in the aftermarket, and it's driving part of a healthy domain business overall. It's a $400 million-plus business, and we're seeing it grow at a lesser rate than we've seen before. Now Q3 was still a relatively tough compare to last year for us in that. So we've seen less of a dip. We see that trend starting to turn like we talked about. We expect Q4 to be an easier compare. And obviously, we expect going into 2024, those comparisons get broadly more easy. But from a volume perspective, overall, we're still seeing a healthy $400 million-plus business on an annual basis. We continue to see the momentum. Like we stated earlier, in the year, we're not seeing the large transactions like we used to, but we continue to see on a volume basis aftermarket being healthy. Yes. Thanks, Deepak. I'll start with the divestitures and the headwinds related to it. A lot of those activities we've completed in the first half of the year. So it will be a little bit of time before the comparables around them start to normalize. They will take to the second half of next year. So it will create a little bit of a headwind going into the year for us. We do have some of those activities still happening in the second half of the year. So it will continue to be something we will point out, call out and talk about the impact. That's why we called out the 150 basis point headwinds related to that going forward. From a stabilization point of view, once we get through the actions that we've taken when you look at the core GoDaddy platform in and of itself, we think this is going to be a low single digit to flat growing business over time. It's got huge high retention rates compared to our normal business, generates a lot of cash flow. And we're seeing them convert over to other areas of the GoDaddy platform when they leave. So they're staying within the technology stack, which is great for us. But we're not looking at that as driving any significant growth in our core platform going forward. So hopefully, that's helpful. On the margin expansion, our model doesn't require double-digit growth going forward. We acknowledge we're living in a dynamic environment and the headwinds in their sales wins are continuing to present themselves. But if you look at the momentum around our A&C business in and of itself, its ability to generate higher normalized EBITDA becoming a bigger part of the picture as we move forward. If you look at our demand, our retention rates, our APRU all of those are pointing to more efficient and our ability to drive that operating margin. That's why we're comfortable and confident about the 31% exit rate and being approximately there when we exit next year. That's why we're confident in saying we're going to grow from there going into '25 and '26 as well. So again, takeaway, not premised on double-digit growth and is looking to continue to expand as we get away from the actions we've taken. We grow A&C. We're on the same technology stack now. And we're seeing the momentum in the business that we think is really going to drive profitable growth moving forward."

And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligations to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. In Q2, we continued to make good progress on our mission, providing a breadth of solutions to a growing number of customers globally. The fundamental health of our business remains strong with new high-quality customers robust retention rates and improved attach. We continue to be on track for stronger growth and profitability in our business, exiting the year at approximately 7% revenue growth and 28% normalized EBITDA margin. For Q2, in our highly competitive Applications & Commerce segment, our revenue of $352 million outperformed our guide with 11% growth. We remain the leader in domains with a 3% growth in private registrations as domains under management grew in the quarter, offset by underperformance in the domain aftermarket. Hosting continues to stabilize from product improvements and the previously announced integration and divestitures of noncore hosting assets. Gross adds remain strong on efficient marketing while maintaining our customer retention for GoDaddy brand at 85%. And Customers are now bundling new solutions at a faster rate than we have ever seen before. Innovation, resulting in higher monetization through attach and pricing with strong retention underpins our confidence in the positive trajectory of our business and our ability to drive shareholder value for years to come. At GoDaddy, we are focused on creating value for customers through innovation strengthening product market fit, and driving towards a one-stop shop. We move quickly to understand and take advantage of the step function changes, generative AI buffers to our industry. In just a few months, we have already launched multiple new generative AI-based features that our customers are actively using to reduce their workload and there is more to come. As you know, our care organization has guided customers to success for over 25 years. And now for the first time, we can bundle each GoDaddy domain purchase with an AI-powered GoDaddy digital guide. The digital guide will automatically build a free personalized basic website, including a checkout path, they take payments. It proposes brand colors creates a free logo and embeds it in the basic website. It also creates marketing messages with our customers' logo and post to social media to generate traffic to their sites. The digital guide built on years of our experience, knows the journey of our customers from identity to presence to commerce and can automatically present solutions in a unique way so they can experience a new product in context. For example, the digital guy can configure e-mail or a new phone number and bring messages from SMS and social sites to our conversation\u2019s app, giving our customers one simple inbox that aggregates their customers' messages. And at the same time, the digital guide writes proposed responses practically removing the effort and time taken to respond to inbound messages.  Bundling this with the domain purchase is different from anything else available across the industry. and GoDaddy is in a unique position to pursue this disruptive approach at scale. These new capabilities can improve loyalty and retention and bring differentiated offerings to our existing base of 21 million customers driving an increase in lifetime value. We are excited about bringing these new features to our customers and our teams have been energized to build new experiences powered by generative AI.  In November at our investor dinner in Tempe, we look forward to showing you demos of these new capabilities. As always, I also wanted to briefly touch on our three priorities: driving commerce through presence, delivering for Pros, and innovating in domains. -- on commerce, we continue to drive strong growth in our OmniCommerce solutions. Customers in our base continue to convert to GoDaddy payments at an impressive rate and attaching to our base was again the strongest component of our year-over-year GPV growth, which is on pace to more than double our last year's exit rate. We'll add to this momentum through our anticipated Q3 launch of GoDaddy payments in Canada as we deploy our successful U.S. playbook.  Website plus marketing continues to perform well, and we are driving greater engagement with customers with new product launches. We know that higher engagement is correlated with higher retention rates, and we expect engagement to be a driver of website and commerce performance metrics.  On delivering for PROS, improvements in our Managed WordPress solutions have reached an important milestone, driving improvement in retention rates as customers begin to recognize and enhance solution. We now offer one of the industry's fastest, most secure and easiest managed word breast platforms. in a recent third-party performance benchmarking study, sites hosted on GoDaddy's WordPress loaded an impressive 2x faster, which results in improved search engine rankings for our customers, and domain customers are not the only ones with a digital gun.  We have launched similar capabilities in the Pro hub and are measuring the time saved for Pros, including generating site content and client communications on innovation in domains, while bundling the GoDaddy digital guide and its enhanced offerings is the most exciting change we are bringing to domains. I wanted to quickly share an update on payable domains as well. payable domains made a meaningful contribution to GPV growth this quarter with healthy double-digit month-over-month growth. This is a unique product that only GoDaddy offers. And with GoDaddy's digital guide, we expect to continue to make it simpler for customers to understand and adopt it.  In closing, we feel good about our continued progress and how our organization is positioned to take us into the next phase of our growth with strong applications and commerce momentum? We have also continued to be efficient with our marketing spend, especially with the improvements we have made in search engine marketing, and we are eager to duplicate those results in other channels. we expect growth to accelerate as we exit the year and remain committed to our growth algorithm with increasing margins and expanding free cash flow per share, and we remain eager to continue to deliver value for all GoDaddy stakeholders. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. In just the last few years, GoDaddy, successfully built a growing competitive and robust set of tools and services, including our websites plus marketing product and OmniCommerce solution at a one-stop shop, empowering entrepreneurs to build and manage their ventures and accept payments with a dedicated partner by their side. The product innovation and targeted investment over this period has led to a better suite of products. And with our soon-to-be launched GoDaddy digital guide, we will provide an even further differentiated experience for our customers. propelling long-term growth for GoDaddy through faster product attachment and stronger retention.  As we consider the many headwinds we faced in the first half of the year, we are thrilled with the continued momentum of our applications in commerce revenue and the acceleration in our Create & Grow solutions. Our durable model continues to generate free cash flow, and we expect to reaccelerate our growth and improve our profitability as we exit the year while delivering on our cash flow targets. Moving to our financial results. Our applications and commerce revenue grew to $352 million, up 11%, surpassing our guide of 8% to 10% and delivering a segment EBITDA margin of 41%. The strength in our Applications & Commerce segment is fueled by our create gross solutions, which accelerated to $465 billion in ARR, up 11%. Additionally, we drove rapid growth in GPV comparable to last quarter, and we are on pace to more than double the 2022 exit rate by the end of the year. as we continue to attract and convert customers within our 21 million base to GoDaddy payments. ARR for applications and commerce grew 10% to more than $1.3 billion. with a 20% growth in annualized GMV to over $33 billion. Core platform revenue totaled $696 million, flat year-over-year with a segment EBITDA margin of 27%. ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion. Core platform revenue was supported by 3% growth in domains on stronger customer additions from higher demand and price increases. This was primarily offset by greater-than-expected declines in our aftermarket on aftermarket. Revenue decreased 5% to $101 million on a tough compare from last year. Over the last five years, we've built upwards of a $400 million revenue two-sided marketplace. As a reminder, this business allows a buyer and seller to transact on our platform at their agreed upon valuation. This business rapidly grew as we scaled the operations, participants, and partnerships. What we see now is a post-COVID normalization of this business as valuation of larger transactions have decreased and volume growth has slowed. With that, we expect steady low to mid-single-digit top-line growth for the business on a go-forward basis. On our core platform restructuring initiative, we completed the migration of Media Temple and Main Street Hub customers to the GoDaddy technology stack. And the 123 Reg migration is planned to be completed by the end of the year. As expected, these migrations produce a slightly elevated churn on these brands this quarter, but will deliver further cost efficiencies in the future. The retention rate of customers for the GoDaddy branded products remains above 85%.  Total revenue grew to $1.05 billion up 3% on a reported basis and 4% excluding aftermarket. Constant currency revenue increased 4%. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 3% on a reported basis. and 6% on a constant currency basis. Our ARPU grew 3% to $199 from $193 last year, and we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers despite the headwinds from our migration efforts.  Normalized EBITDA grew 2% set to $265 million, while delivering a margin of 25%. Bookings totaled $1.1 billion, growing 2% on a reported basis. and 4%, excluding aftermarket and the impact of the integration of non-core assets. Bookings grew 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of aftermarket, the drivers of growth in bookings were strong customer additions and price increases in domains as well as strong attach in applications and commerce. We expect these factors to contribute to accelerated revenue growth next year.  Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $284 million, growing 3%. While free cash flow was relatively flat at $240 million despite increased interest-related payments. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.44 on a trailing 12-month basis. versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.67, a 14% increase driven by execution, operating leverage, and share repurchases.  Through July 31, we repurchased 10.2 million shares year-to-date, totaling $746 million, of which $632 million was repurchased since the end of Q1. This brings the cumulative share repurchase under the current authorization to $2 billion and 27.1 million shares, reducing shares outstanding since the inception of this authorization by 16% and we remain on part for our commitment to reduce our fully diluted shares outstanding by 15% to 20% over the three-year period.  Additionally, today, we announced an incremental $1 billion share buyback authorization to bring the total authorization to $4 billion and extending the program out to 2025. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $583 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt stands at $3.3 billion with a 2.9 times net leverage within our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times. Lastly, we secured a 75-basis point interest rate reduction on $1.8 billion of outstanding principal through a refinance issued at par. This refinance is expected to save $13 million annually in interest payments for each of the next seven years. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q3 total revenue in the range of $1.055 billion to $1.075 billion, representing growth of 3% at the midpoint. With the current momentum, we expect to exit the year at approximately 7% top-line growth with a normalized EBITDA of 28%, an increase of 300 basis points from our 2021 exit rate of 25%. We are increasing our growth expectations for applications and commerce to be between 9% and 11% for Q3 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to be flat in Q3 and reaccelerate in the fourth quarter to deliver 1% growth for the full year.  Q3 Normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve to approximately 26% with continued acceleration over the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 26%. This is a 300-basis point increase from our 2021 rate of 23% on better operating leverage from improved marketing performance, restructuring efforts benefits from our continued move of loads to cloud and the incorporation of AI into our operating model. On the growth bridge we spoke about last quarter, we remain confident in the path to accelerated revenue growth. While expanding margins and improving cash flows.  As a reminder, this year's revenue growth rate includes approximately two points of FX pressure from last year's bookings. Difficult compares in our aftermarket business and the migration and divested certain non-core assets. We expect momentum in bookings in the second half of the year to drive the reacceleration of revenue growth as we exit the year while we remain committed to delivering our margin expansion and free cash flow targets.  We will be posting our annual investor dinner with product demonstrations in November at our Planning and Investor Day in Q1 '2024, we consider both a great opportunity to share more about our exciting initiatives in AI and our outlook for the next three years. In closing, we remain confident in our ability to execute in the areas of our business within our control and deliver the full-year targets. As always, we remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities, committed to being responsible stewards of capital, and strive every day to provide a one-stop shop to micro businesses, along their entrepreneurial journey with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team to open the call all for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks, for taking my questions. Two of them. First, I wanted to ask on the acceleration of the core business in the fourth quarter in Pleasant healthy sequential increase. Maybe you can just discuss what are the factors that are driving that increase.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Matt. When we look at Q2 and bookings and kind of trade off in the second half of the year, a couple of things to consider: one, -- we have FX that will be abating. We have pricing increases that we did towards the end of the quarter, which should help with our bookings and somewhat revenue into this year. Obviously, the aftermarket compares get better going into Q4. And now that we've completed some of our migrations to the core GoDaddy stack, we should see start -- some of those start to abate as we get through the half year.  So that gives us the confidence that we will have that accelerating growth rate as we get through the remainder of this year. That, coupled with some of the demand we're seeing at the front of the funnel with customers coming in, attaching new products faster. Our retention rates remaining strong and the momentum we have in application commerce, we feel good about that momentum coming out of Q4 and going into 2024.\nMatt Pfau: Great. And on the digital guide, maybe you can just help us understand what that rollout is going to look like? Is it just going to be for new customers? Or do you plan to roll that out to your existing base as well?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Matt. Yes, we plan to roll it out to the existing base as well. The digital is about literally a guide that works for a customer, even when the customer is sleeping. So even with the base, the guy will be able to offer or create new offerings for them. So, it will start with new, just like a lot of other products do, but you'll see us quickly take it to the base as well.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks, for taking my questions.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vikram please go ahead.\nVikram Kesavabhotla : I wanted to ask about the applications and commerce segment. It looks like you raised the expectation there for fiscal '23. Maybe if you could talk some more about the primary drivers behind that revision. And then separately, I also wanted to ask about the EBITDA margins. It looks like you posted about 25% in the second quarter. You're guiding to 26% in 3Q and exiting the year at 28%. Could you just talk through some of the main drivers of the expansion there throughout the balance of the year? Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: I'll start with the application commerce. We can continue to -- sorry, we continue to see strong momentum in the front of the tunnel and customer bundling payments and choosing payments are coming through with websites really happy and excited about that attach and that bundling that's happening at the front of the funnel. Again, I alluded to, we have really strong net gross customer adds coming in and they're getting to that bundled product quicker with that, that gets us to higher retention rates. That, coupled with some pricing increases we're doing at the back half of Q2, where we did at the back half of Q2 should start to show up in applications and comments as we go.  Also seeing great momentum on the conversion. We've talked about it previously, but our existing customers converting over to the GoDaddy payments. That motion is well in work, and we're seeing that AGV grow as we go out throughout the year. On the margin expansion, we had about 25%. We're forecasting to get up 28%. We have a couple of things going on there. We're seeing greater marketing efficiency, which is helping us. We are really starting to see the benefits of moving into the cloud. We're seeing the cost efficiencies that are coming with more workloads and that are really starting to take hold as we hit certain milestones throughout the year.  We also had the restructuring in Q2. And some of that will gain steam as we go into the back half of the year and overall momentum as we go through there. So, we have a lot of, I would say, moving parts that are all pointing in the same direction that make us feel good about expanding our margins while expanding our growth rate as well through applications of coverage.\nVikram Kesavabhotla : Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. First, on core platform now expecting around 1% growth for the full year within the main lines there, aftermarket domains ex aftermarket and security and hosting, which linear line are kind of underperforming relative to your prior expectations. And then second one on that AI-powered digital guide, do you view that as kind of complementary to the higher-touch customer care organization? Or do you see that functionality eventually kind of helping alleviate some of the cost or headcount within the care organization?\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Trevor. I'll start with the aftermarket and the core platform. We really saw underperformed this quarter. We've grown a $400 million business there over a number of years. We saw a lot of growth back half of '21 coming into '22. So, no doubt we have compares. But as we've talked previously, the larger transactions and the valuations on them have abated. We're seeing the volumes slowing growth as well coming on Q2. And to put it in perspective, we're seeing great demand and gross ads within our funnel, but it seems the valuations on the aftermarket still are connecting with the buyers.  So, we're seeing them lean towards the domain growth. And we think this is a normalization for now. I think we -- we've taken it out of our back half of the year expectations, and we think this is going to be a low to mid-single-digit growth business going forward. So, I would really point to the aftermarket on this as being part.\nAman Bhutani: And Trevor, on the digital guide, we couldn't be more excited about bearing a guide with every domain purchase and letting that digital guide the customer just like we do in care. We've done a phenomenal job in care over the last few years by sort of creating leverage on the Care line item as revenue grew, we get costs pretty flat. And it's a little early to be talking about the impacts of AI. But overall, we do see leading to efficiencies in our business overall. And frankly, we've already showed that in Marketing, where by implementing machine learning, we're able to make our spend more and more efficient. And we've been seeing the results of that over the last year already.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thank you, both.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved please go ahead.\nNaved Khan : Thanks. Just a question on the outlook. So, 28% EBITDA margin by Q4. If I have to think about next year, 2024, and I know you're not guiding to that, but is there any reason why 28% shouldn't be the base? To start with, I mean, the cost savings will still be layering in because this is not a full year for cost savings, right? So, am I thinking about it the right way? Just any comment there would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Naved, thanks. We're excited on our Investor Day coming up in the first quarter, and we'll get more into the details of what we'll look like. We're really excited about our margin expansion going into Q4, the 28%, if we look back to the Q4 in 2021, we've increased our margins by 300 basis points. Even year-over-year, we get to the same 300 basis points. So, it's something we continue to work on. We continue to find efficiencies in our operation, and we'll continue to push margin growth going into 2024. At the same time, we're accelerating revenue and hitting our cash flow objectives well.  So, I don't want to give you too much of a leading what 2024 is going to look like, but we're really excited about our progress, the work we've done in the first half of the year and how that's going to benefit us in the back half of the year and then ultimately into 2024.\nNaved Khan : Got it. And then the -- you kind of alluded to the bridge to sort of resumption of growth or healthy growth, right? So -- and the one that you shared last call was, I think, getting you back into the double digits. So, if I have to think about when you start to see like the full -- the effect of full anniversary-ing and kind of getting to that, how should I think about timing? Is it Q1? Is it early next year? At what point would be kind of this would be in the real war for you?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks. And try not to peg a specific timetable here as we're getting into the back half of the year. We'll talk more about it later. But when we look at the full-year guide this year and we kind of look at the impact of FX, the difficult aftermarket compares and migrations and divestitures we're doing -- they will start to abate into the fourth quarter and continue to abate and turn into tailwinds as we go through 2024. Not trying to pick a quarter on anything right now. We'll talk more about that later in the year. But the momentum has us accelerating revenue as we go through units.\nAman Bhutani: And if I could just add, Long term, we're excited about the path to accelerating growth because it's based on the simple idea that create products that can lead the customer through the entrepreneur\u2019s wheel, which you remember is about leading them through identity to presence to commerce really creates a flywheel for the company. our technology has improved in a very significant way. That leads to greater attach, not just for new customers for our base as well. That involves identifying a customer that is most connecting and reaching out and engaging the customer and then closing the customer.  Of course, you've seen us do it successfully with e-mail over the last three years, four years where that business has product business has performed very well for us. And now you're seeing it us do it with the OmniCommerce solution as well where a GPV has grown nicely, and we can clearly see that we have a ton of customers in our base that would love that product from us.  So, at the core, our path to long-term path to accelerating growth is about innovation in the product. It's creating value for the customer that leads to monetization opportunities like attach like pricing and strong retention that come together to sort of give us the confidence we're sharing with you about the positive momentum in our business, and that's what we believe will drive long-term shareholder value for years and years to come.\nMark McCaffrey: And if I could just add to that and to clarify, we -- while we look out in '24, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023 in the range for revenue just FYI [ph].\nNaved Khan : Thank you, guys.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is John Ben for Brent Thill. First question GMV had pretty good growth accelerate 20% year-over-year and also up 18% sequentially. Just wondering what might have be some of the drivers? I mean, are you seeing any sort of improvement in macro and GMV per customer? Or is it just better attached, if you could parse that, that would be great.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. GMV growing as a function of sort of the macro to start with. We are seeing more of our existing customers transact more with the solutions they have. To remind you, a lot of our GMV is a function of the relationship we have through the bank. So, it's a different financial model for us, but it gives us a great barometer. It gets our product out there. We get to see sort of what's happening in the world. So, we are very happy with the growth and it basically signifies more and more people using the GoDaddy solutions for their businesses, both off-line and in store \nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And maybe any update on the FIS Worldpay partnership? \nAman Bhutani: Partnership is doing great. We have launched the product with them. We have a set of customers that are using our new solutions, still very early since we're only about a month in, I think, from the launch. So, it's still pretty early, but very happy with the progress. I dare say that our partners are pretty excited about the progress too. And I think they can't wait to get out there and sell it more and we can't wait to see those customers.\nMark McCaffrey: And we'd always said the impact on 2024 was -- sorry, 2023 is going to be minimal, and we would start to see the momentum of that going into 2024, which again adds very excitement about that momentum.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Godoi from Benchmark. Mark please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Alex on for Mark. Just a question on payable domains. So last quarter, you characterized contribution is modest, and it sounds like there was meaningful performance in 2Q from payable domains. Just curious if you could perhaps discuss what was the most meaningful driver for that -- for the outperformance in applications in commerce or whether or not payable domains as a material driver of that.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. I'll maybe let Mark talk at on commerce and sort of payable domain, I'd probably say it's still very early and OmniCommerce is pretty big. But let me sort of step back and answer your question around what's driving the growth of payable domains. Obviously, you're very aware, we have 21 million customers. We have 84 million domains under management. We have a ton of opportunity to attach this new and unique product. That's why you hear the excitement from me on it on a continuous basis. And of course, the math adds up very quickly, the more customers we can get on it. The biggest drivers over the last quarter for payable domains is we started to really surface payroll domain in the journey and engagement that happy with us because it's still a new concept for people. Our customers don't automatically understand that they've brought the domain and with a couple of clicks, they can start taking payments. So, we found better ways to guide the customer through that path, get them live with the capability. And what we find is once we get them live with that capability, sure enough, they start to transact, right? And you know our overall math in terms of retention rate. We have -- if we have one product with a customer, they tend to retain sort of mid-80s. If we have two, it jumps. If we have three products with a customer, we pretty much have a customer for life.  And the LTV also goes to 80x, 83x once they have commenced with us. So, all of that math is working, but it's dependent on us getting more people to adopt this product, and that's what you started to see in Q2, when more people saw the product go, I didn't know this was there. Let me add it. Let me start using it, and that's what sort of created the quick, if you will, double-digit month-over-month growth in the GPV. Hopefully, that makes sense.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And I'll add on applications comments in general, where we're really excited is strong gross customer adds are coming in and coming stronger than we've seen in a long time. Not only are they coming into the funnel, they are getting to that second product -- and whether it's payable domains, whether it's payments, whether it's commerce, whether it's wet like marketing, they're bundling those together at the initial stages. We think the digital guide will also accelerate that as that starts to at faster rate.  But when that happens, when like man said, when we get to that second product, that third product, we get to a third product attached, generally, we find we have a customer for life, and that really drives the all this because the decisions around it are being made faster on the top of the funnel, help us get there faster and drive that LTV equation. Obviously, it helps to -- with our cash flow, and it helps us be more efficient because we're getting greater revenue prices or getting better revenue and a better efficient operating margin as well.  So, we feel really good about all that happening in the applications and commerce. It's really driving a lot of momentum. We have that on top of the hardware sales that we are seeing that are driving that momentum as well, a lot of positivity coming right? And it all starts with the domain and innovating in the demand.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian : I'm not re-asking this, but I want to start on domains. We continue to kind of see some, let's say, challenging growth from [indiscernible]. I know you guys are involved in, and other TLDs two, which if there's interesting things to point out about that, we'd love to hear. But just maybe just some of what you're seeing around that expectations for when that can start to normalize, how that's impacting the aftermarket? And then a really interesting comment about channel partners who are pushing more on ARPU than they were on new users. And I don't know if there's something to comment around that? Do you think that, that's having an impact? You guys have a big hand in both sides. So, would love to hear your view on that.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Happy to give a bit of color on domains. Obviously, I think you probably saw already domains under management for GoDaddy grew. So definitely, we're doing well on units as well. And to sort of explain a little bit where -- as Mark said, we're seeing better traffic and demand coming to our site. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of that is because of our focus in search engine marketing and us significantly improving our abilities to spend money and search and convert those customers.  So, we're very happy with that as well. And one other maybe mentions to mention to you is that we've continued to grow well internationally. As Mark shared, we grew 6% internationally on a reported basis, 3% constant currency, 6%. And the product we lead with internationally is domains, right? Domains is the number one thing we sell in small markets around the world, we have customers in over 100 markets.  So, it's the combination of those things that I would say that are leading to the best results for us. And our Domains business is broader than any other one particular registry business. You mentioned that yourself, and that's absolutely true. We're the market leader. We have a diverse set of assets within the domains business. We've continued to innovate in many of those areas. And the key pieces where we see good returns this we'll be very efficient in marketing and search, grow the dumps, grow the customers, get customers to the stick, can work them while attach products to them, which obviously isn't what you're asking about, but attach rate products to them and do it around the world really well. Hopefully, that's a bit helpful.\nYgal Arounian : Yes. That's really helpful. And so maybe to segue, I think it's similar. I don't know. A lot of the answers might actually be an overlap. But if there's anything incremental to add. So, just on the gross top of the funnel, gross adds commentary, which feels really strong. And I know you have some noise in your in the new customer number, I believe, still ongoing with some of the sunsetting of the brands. Is there any way to parse out that?  And then what -- is it -- to your point, when you talk about with the SEM work that you're doing that's driving that strength in the top of funnel with domains. Even if your domains under management grew, demand is kind of like, let's say, collectively still soft your commentary around the really strong top of the funnel, I think, stands out. So, I wanted to maybe understand that a little bit better. Thank you. \nAman Bhutani : Yes. Yes. So, gross ads were strong for us, and it was on efficient marketing spend. And I did highlight in the prepared remarks, and I think you repeated that which is that search was a strong contributor to that. And what I added to that is that it's not just search in the U.S., it's search globally. That did a really good job sort of delivering for us.  But it's not a search alone. We have been focused on improving our marketing, the targeting of our migraine, and the measurement of our marketing over the last couple of years. I think we've talked about it multiple different times has been an important priority for us. And what we're seeing as a result is more people show up to the website, right? More people going through the funnel better.  I think one of the things I've talked about, and I don't know if this is what you're asking about. But One of the things in the past that I've talked about is that we have shifted as a company, and we are very much an experimentation-based culture now. teams go out and they try different things and then measure closely whether there's a conversion improvement or not. And that, of course, helps as well, right, where when we land better traffic and conversion is up on the site, that delivers better for us. Whereas in the past, maybe years ago, we may have relied on a combination of the site and care more, what we find now is that the site performs really well. And that's a great way for us to attract gross ads, and we're pretty happy with that result.\nMark McCaffrey : Yes. And I'll just add to that. What we really like about the gross ads coming in is they are customers that have a higher propensity to want to do business and therefore, are attaching a lot faster. And on the churn on the other hand, we are losing the migration and lifting of some of these products. But that relates to what we refer to as [indiscernible] customers that weren't growing the business for necessarily using the functionality. And therefore, we're trading in a good direction as we get to those net ads. \nYgal Arounian : Right. I have a follow-up, but I don't want to I'll jump back in the queue and then...\nAman Bhutani : It's okay, go ahead.\nYgal Arounian : Yes. Okay. So, then this is all super helpful. I love this color. So, you and your peers on the kind of closed-end platforms seem to be all driving efficient marketing spend that's bringing more share were really across the board. And then going back and tying that back into the kind of, let's just say, flattish domains globally, right? It feels like your space is taking a lot of the share of the web-building ecosystem. Is that a fair characterization? And where do you see the share coming from? I think we talked about World Press in the past and maybe you could just help on that. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani : Yes. And we'll provide more color on this at Investor Day for sure, to talk about how website share is shifting. And overall, I think there was -- if we look at the last few quarters, there's more pressure on world press at least from what we saw then, if you go back many years. But taking a longer-term view, the share is still coming from custom HTML sites. That is what is reducing. And there is sort of growing demand and obviously, the new demand goes more towards the newer tools that exist, right, you find that's easier and easier for customers to build sites themselves and get started.  Like our two websites for marketing does a fantastic job of that. You see us at GoDaddy with the digital guy taking the next step. We we're telling you today, and we'll show it to you live with testing with customers. We'll show you live in November in Tempe. How -- when a customer buys a domain, how they behave differently instead of just a domain, you give them a website and get them started. Because the friction for a customer to make another decision and then create content and then do another thing is pretty difficult.  But of course, technology has made this easier and easier over time and now generative AI allows our industry to take the next step in terms of reducing the effort that customers have to do to get started. So, I think you're going to continue to see the momentum. Of course, there are secular trends underneath of entrepreneurship, population, people coming to the Internet. But what how quickly they're able to adopt the tools on the Internet and get a presence up and running, I think you'll continue to see good momentum in that because technology and generative AI now are going to make a real difference.\nYgal Arounian : Thank you so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from Chris Kentaro from Morgan Stanley. Chris, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Christian Kentaro on for the listed quarter. I wanted to ask around the macro and kind of how it's changed Q2 versus Q1. And then the second question would be around the digital guide. Are these capabilities kind of like table six for the industry? Or how do you think about your ability to drive your differentiation in AI against your web-building competitors? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani : No, I can't believe you said table stakes for a digital guide, but let me take your first question first. You surprise me with that. Let's start with the macro. There are a few items that sort of we look at on our dashboard or the leaders in our organization look at when we look at macro and I'll try to touch on a couple of them to give you a bit of color. One of them that we look at is sort of nonbrand demand that's coming to Google as a representation of demand. And are people going out and searching for things? And they're not searching for a particular company, they're just searching for a website, they're just searching for a domain and how is that trending? And what we saw in that data is that there are a few markets in the world and actually the English-speaking markets where we are strong, the U.K. being one of them, we see a good lift in nonbrand demand for the terms that we track. And that's a positive sign for those markets. That means we expect better demand. We expect to spend more money there. And generally, the customer, the everyday entrepreneur is feeling better and wants to engage and buy a domain, start a business or build their business, or so on.  The second group geographically I'll talk about is the markets that are not big English-speaking markets, but what we call the rest of the world. And there, what we see is sort of more similar or flattish behavior in terms of nonbrand searches, those -- as you can see, the international market does really well for us. So, that's been phenomenal. GoDaddy has done a lot to take share globally on those. But in terms of raw demand or macro, what we see is much, much more time sort of behavior. And the U.S. is somewhere a little bit in the middle. I won't comment sort of broad macro on the U.S. of you understand it better than I probably do. But Rod, if I talk about demand on the terms that we track to, there's some good news, but not as good as a couple of the other markets. And the second data point to look at is customer -- consumer confidence, and we track that for all of our main markets. And what we see there, again, is sort of an expectation for many of that confidence would go down, and it was probably trending down in some of those markets, but over the last two months, three months, a little bit of a reversal. So, maybe instead of going down towards, we see more flat. But in some markets, and again, I'll mention the U.K., you actually see it coming off, which I think you didn't expect if you're just sort of a macro person. And there are other markets that are sort of showing different behavior as well.  But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on a couple of the core metrics that we look at and a couple of sort of a little bit of a geographic lens on it. In terms of the digital guide, which I think was a second question, I just want to reiterate the digital guide is a technology built using AI that uses generative AI to generate content that uses AI for a lot of other purposes. And our goal is to couple that with every domain in purchase. So, when you buy a domain, a digital guy is automatically enabled for that customer. And what it's trying to do is find that best experience and path for that particular customer and get them through that path, whether it's adding new products, whether it's posting something, whether it's reminding them or something. And it's not trying to do it in a way that says, \"Hey, come buy this from me. What it's doing is it's actually doing the work for the customer in advance and then say, take a look. If you like this, we can keep that, right? So, I don't think of that as stable stakes at all.  If I look at -- and I'm not even talking about our industry, if I look at sort of across the technology landscape. Of course, there are technologies out there and a lot of people want to do similar things. But I don't see anyone starting at the point of a domain name. And we have AI or generative AI-ready capabilities. We're already testing many of these things. And I think in the past, I've talked about them. or last quarter, I mentioned one or two of them. But we have capabilities that are live today that are being tested with customers. And there isn't anyone else that's going to bring it to millions of the main names and set people off the way we want to start right. So, that's the big thing. And I guess, for folks that may have joined just a minute or two late. There was a great little video that we started with today, and I assume we've posted somewhere I'm pointing to one. I assume we post it, it's that two-minute video is a great way for you to understand what our -- what we want to our customers to experience. And how much effort we are taking away from the customer that one customer would have to do and letting the digital guy do that. And believe it or not, that happens today in care right now. Customers call us and what they want is that they want us to give them confidence, and they want us to encourage them. And at the same time, they want us to solve their problems and give them access to more tools.  And we do all of that -- and we're trying to take the learning that we have in care and enable every customer with it so that we can scale to literally every customer that buys with us.\nMark McCaffrey: I'll add one of the distinctions we have is from identity to presence, to commerce, we have the entire technology set. So, when we use generative AI, we could take it across their entire journey, and we start with the domain, and that makes that journey faster gets us the bundling faster, gets us to customers for life for us, and driving LTV into our financials. So, we're really excited about it. But one of the great distinctions is we have the entire technology stack around it to use they are around.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe one other quick thing I'll add is that I think we learned last year that having people see and demo working functionality to them that customers can see is very powerful. So, I would invite all of you, and I know many of you joined. So, I would invite all of you to Tempe in November. So, you can do it yourself with us, demoing it without showing you what that experience is for our customers. And then I think it will sort of illuminate the idea in a much better way.\nAman Bhutani : And the temperature is much cooler in November.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Navid Khan from B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nNavid Khan : Okay good. Yes, a quick follow-up. So, one is we saw a transaction, Google domains being sold to Square space. And I wanted to get your thoughts on what it means for the other participants such as yourself in terms of competition. And then the other question I had was on the price increase on the A&C segment. What was the magnitude of the increase?\nAman Bhutani : Yes. Let me take the domains piece first. And then, Mark, if you want to touch on the pricing or I can touch on that to Peter. On the Google domain space, the way we look at it, Navid, is that anytime there's a transition like this, there's a disruption in the customer experience or flow. Customers tend to put their heads up and they'll look at what other options might exist for them.  And given our brand awareness and leadership position in the world of domains, given the care we provide given our high transactional NPS, and just sort of broad understanding from a very large number of people what GoDaddy brings to the table. And the more we attach to that bundle with that domain, I think we're positioned very well to see if some disruption happens that we're there and it's advantageous to us, right? In terms of beyond. But I think our goal is to just do a fantastic job delivering, providing customer\u2019s great products. And we think we're doing a good job at attracting customers, we're growing down. And I mean, maybe the way to say it is we were the leader in the mains when Google came into the business and we're a leader in domains when Google is leading the business. So, we're okay with that. And then on the AMC pricing, I assume the question is to website plus marketing pricing? I think.\nMark McCaffrey : Yes. I don't think we've gotten into the magnitude of breaking down pricing by each of the different components of it. I'll give it a little color. I think last year, we focused mostly on pricing increases around renewals. This year, we're doing it on new as well as renewals. So, I would say than we did last year. Obviously, our priority is always retention rates in sticking with -- but we took those pricing increases at the end of Q2, and we should start to see them materialize as we go throughout the year.\nNavid Khan : Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey : Thanks, Navid.\nChristie Masoner: I will now turn the call over to Aman for some closing remarks. \nAman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and I'll just end by thanking all the GoDaddy employees for another good quarter. And just to remind all of our Anderson shareholders where -- we're super excited about the products we're bringing to market. We're super excited about attaching into our base that we've demonstrated with e-mail and are demonstrating with commerce now. We're super excited about the trajectory we have going into Q3 and Q4. Ending the year at accelerating growth and strong margin, setting up next year really well. I look forward to the next call. Thank you very much.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. In Q2, we continued to make good progress on our mission, providing a breadth of solutions to a growing number of customers globally. The fundamental health of our business remains strong with new high-quality customers robust retention rates and improved attach. We continue to be on track for stronger growth and profitability in our business, exiting the year at approximately 7% revenue growth and 28% normalized EBITDA margin. For Q2, in our highly competitive Applications & Commerce segment, our revenue of $352 million outperformed our guide with 11% growth. We remain the leader in domains with a 3% growth in private registrations as domains under management grew in the quarter, offset by underperformance in the domain aftermarket. Hosting continues to stabilize from product improvements and the previously announced integration and divestitures of noncore hosting assets. Gross adds remain strong on efficient marketing while maintaining our customer retention for GoDaddy brand at 85%. And Customers are now bundling new solutions at a faster rate than we have ever seen before. Innovation, resulting in higher monetization through attach and pricing with strong retention underpins our confidence in the positive trajectory of our business and our ability to drive shareholder value for years to come. At GoDaddy, we are focused on creating value for customers through innovation strengthening product market fit, and driving towards a one-stop shop. We move quickly to understand and take advantage of the step function changes, generative AI buffers to our industry. In just a few months, we have already launched multiple new generative AI-based features that our customers are actively using to reduce their workload and there is more to come. As you know, our care organization has guided customers to success for over 25 years. And now for the first time, we can bundle each GoDaddy domain purchase with an AI-powered GoDaddy digital guide. The digital guide will automatically build a free personalized basic website, including a checkout path, they take payments. It proposes brand colors creates a free logo and embeds it in the basic website. It also creates marketing messages with our customers' logo and post to social media to generate traffic to their sites. The digital guide built on years of our experience, knows the journey of our customers from identity to presence to commerce and can automatically present solutions in a unique way so they can experience a new product in context. For example, the digital guy can configure e-mail or a new phone number and bring messages from SMS and social sites to our conversation's app, giving our customers one simple inbox that aggregates their customers' messages. And at the same time, the digital guide writes proposed responses practically removing the effort and time taken to respond to inbound messages.  Bundling this with the domain purchase is different from anything else available across the industry. and GoDaddy is in a unique position to pursue this disruptive approach at scale. These new capabilities can improve loyalty and retention and bring differentiated offerings to our existing base of 21 million customers driving an increase in lifetime value. We are excited about bringing these new features to our customers and our teams have been energized to build new experiences powered by generative AI.  In November at our investor dinner in Tempe, we look forward to showing you demos of these new capabilities. As always, I also wanted to briefly touch on our three priorities: driving commerce through presence, delivering for Pros, and innovating in domains. -- on commerce, we continue to drive strong growth in our OmniCommerce solutions. Customers in our base continue to convert to GoDaddy payments at an impressive rate and attaching to our base was again the strongest component of our year-over-year GPV growth, which is on pace to more than double our last year's exit rate. We'll add to this momentum through our anticipated Q3 launch of GoDaddy payments in Canada as we deploy our successful U.S. playbook.  Website plus marketing continues to perform well, and we are driving greater engagement with customers with new product launches. We know that higher engagement is correlated with higher retention rates, and we expect engagement to be a driver of website and commerce performance metrics.  On delivering for PROS, improvements in our Managed WordPress solutions have reached an important milestone, driving improvement in retention rates as customers begin to recognize and enhance solution. We now offer one of the industry's fastest, most secure and easiest managed word breast platforms. in a recent third-party performance benchmarking study, sites hosted on GoDaddy's WordPress loaded an impressive 2x faster, which results in improved search engine rankings for our customers, and domain customers are not the only ones with a digital gun.  We have launched similar capabilities in the Pro hub and are measuring the time saved for Pros, including generating site content and client communications on innovation in domains, while bundling the GoDaddy digital guide and its enhanced offerings is the most exciting change we are bringing to domains. I wanted to quickly share an update on payable domains as well. payable domains made a meaningful contribution to GPV growth this quarter with healthy double-digit month-over-month growth. This is a unique product that only GoDaddy offers. And with GoDaddy's digital guide, we expect to continue to make it simpler for customers to understand and adopt it.  In closing, we feel good about our continued progress and how our organization is positioned to take us into the next phase of our growth with strong applications and commerce momentum? We have also continued to be efficient with our marketing spend, especially with the improvements we have made in search engine marketing, and we are eager to duplicate those results in other channels. we expect growth to accelerate as we exit the year and remain committed to our growth algorithm with increasing margins and expanding free cash flow per share, and we remain eager to continue to deliver value for all GoDaddy stakeholders. With that, here's Mark. Thanks, Matt. Yes, we plan to roll it out to the existing base as well. The digital is about literally a guide that works for a customer, even when the customer is sleeping. So even with the base, the guy will be able to offer or create new offerings for them. So, it will start with new, just like a lot of other products do, but you'll see us quickly take it to the base as well. And Trevor, on the digital guide, we couldn't be more excited about bearing a guide with every domain purchase and letting that digital guide the customer just like we do in care. We've done a phenomenal job in care over the last few years by sort of creating leverage on the Care line item as revenue grew, we get costs pretty flat. And it's a little early to be talking about the impacts of AI. But overall, we do see leading to efficiencies in our business overall. And frankly, we've already showed that in Marketing, where by implementing machine learning, we're able to make our spend more and more efficient. And we've been seeing the results of that over the last year already. And if I could just add, Long term, we're excited about the path to accelerating growth because it's based on the simple idea that create products that can lead the customer through the entrepreneur's wheel, which you remember is about leading them through identity to presence to commerce really creates a flywheel for the company. our technology has improved in a very significant way. That leads to greater attach, not just for new customers for our base as well. That involves identifying a customer that is most connecting and reaching out and engaging the customer and then closing the customer.  Of course, you've seen us do it successfully with e-mail over the last three years, four years where that business has product business has performed very well for us. And now you're seeing it us do it with the OmniCommerce solution as well where a GPV has grown nicely, and we can clearly see that we have a ton of customers in our base that would love that product from us.  So, at the core, our path to long-term path to accelerating growth is about innovation in the product. It's creating value for the customer that leads to monetization opportunities like attach like pricing and strong retention that come together to sort of give us the confidence we're sharing with you about the positive momentum in our business, and that's what we believe will drive long-term shareholder value for years and years to come. Yes. GMV growing as a function of sort of the macro to start with. We are seeing more of our existing customers transact more with the solutions they have. To remind you, a lot of our GMV is a function of the relationship we have through the bank. So, it's a different financial model for us, but it gives us a great barometer. It gets our product out there. We get to see sort of what's happening in the world. So, we are very happy with the growth and it basically signifies more and more people using the GoDaddy solutions for their businesses, both off-line and in store Partnership is doing great. We have launched the product with them. We have a set of customers that are using our new solutions, still very early since we're only about a month in, I think, from the launch. So, it's still pretty early, but very happy with the progress. I dare say that our partners are pretty excited about the progress too. And I think they can't wait to get out there and sell it more and we can't wait to see those customers. Yes. I'll maybe let Mark talk at on commerce and sort of payable domain, I'd probably say it's still very early and OmniCommerce is pretty big. But let me sort of step back and answer your question around what's driving the growth of payable domains. Obviously, you're very aware, we have 21 million customers. We have 84 million domains under management. We have a ton of opportunity to attach this new and unique product. That's why you hear the excitement from me on it on a continuous basis. And of course, the math adds up very quickly, the more customers we can get on it. The biggest drivers over the last quarter for payable domains is we started to really surface payroll domain in the journey and engagement that happy with us because it's still a new concept for people. Our customers don't automatically understand that they've brought the domain and with a couple of clicks, they can start taking payments. So, we found better ways to guide the customer through that path, get them live with the capability. And what we find is once we get them live with that capability, sure enough, they start to transact, right? And you know our overall math in terms of retention rate. We have -- if we have one product with a customer, they tend to retain sort of mid-80s. If we have two, it jumps. If we have three products with a customer, we pretty much have a customer for life.  And the LTV also goes to 80x, 83x once they have commenced with us. So, all of that math is working, but it's dependent on us getting more people to adopt this product, and that's what you started to see in Q2, when more people saw the product go, I didn't know this was there. Let me add it. Let me start using it, and that's what sort of created the quick, if you will, double-digit month-over-month growth in the GPV. Hopefully, that makes sense. Yes. Happy to give a bit of color on domains. Obviously, I think you probably saw already domains under management for GoDaddy grew. So definitely, we're doing well on units as well. And to sort of explain a little bit where -- as Mark said, we're seeing better traffic and demand coming to our site. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of that is because of our focus in search engine marketing and us significantly improving our abilities to spend money and search and convert those customers.  So, we're very happy with that as well. And one other maybe mentions to mention to you is that we've continued to grow well internationally. As Mark shared, we grew 6% internationally on a reported basis, 3% constant currency, 6%. And the product we lead with internationally is domains, right? Domains is the number one thing we sell in small markets around the world, we have customers in over 100 markets.  So, it's the combination of those things that I would say that are leading to the best results for us. And our Domains business is broader than any other one particular registry business. You mentioned that yourself, and that's absolutely true. We're the market leader. We have a diverse set of assets within the domains business. We've continued to innovate in many of those areas. And the key pieces where we see good returns this we'll be very efficient in marketing and search, grow the dumps, grow the customers, get customers to the stick, can work them while attach products to them, which obviously isn't what you're asking about, but attach rate products to them and do it around the world really well. Hopefully, that's a bit helpful. Yes. Yes. So, gross ads were strong for us, and it was on efficient marketing spend. And I did highlight in the prepared remarks, and I think you repeated that which is that search was a strong contributor to that. And what I added to that is that it's not just search in the U.S., it's search globally. That did a really good job sort of delivering for us.  But it's not a search alone. We have been focused on improving our marketing, the targeting of our migraine, and the measurement of our marketing over the last couple of years. I think we've talked about it multiple different times has been an important priority for us. And what we're seeing as a result is more people show up to the website, right? More people going through the funnel better.  I think one of the things I've talked about, and I don't know if this is what you're asking about. But One of the things in the past that I've talked about is that we have shifted as a company, and we are very much an experimentation-based culture now. teams go out and they try different things and then measure closely whether there's a conversion improvement or not. And that, of course, helps as well, right, where when we land better traffic and conversion is up on the site, that delivers better for us. Whereas in the past, maybe years ago, we may have relied on a combination of the site and care more, what we find now is that the site performs really well. And that's a great way for us to attract gross ads, and we're pretty happy with that result. It's okay, go ahead. Yes. And we'll provide more color on this at Investor Day for sure, to talk about how website share is shifting. And overall, I think there was -- if we look at the last few quarters, there's more pressure on world press at least from what we saw then, if you go back many years. But taking a longer-term view, the share is still coming from custom HTML sites. That is what is reducing. And there is sort of growing demand and obviously, the new demand goes more towards the newer tools that exist, right, you find that's easier and easier for customers to build sites themselves and get started.  Like our two websites for marketing does a fantastic job of that. You see us at GoDaddy with the digital guy taking the next step. We we're telling you today, and we'll show it to you live with testing with customers. We'll show you live in November in Tempe. How -- when a customer buys a domain, how they behave differently instead of just a domain, you give them a website and get them started. Because the friction for a customer to make another decision and then create content and then do another thing is pretty difficult.  But of course, technology has made this easier and easier over time and now generative AI allows our industry to take the next step in terms of reducing the effort that customers have to do to get started. So, I think you're going to continue to see the momentum. Of course, there are secular trends underneath of entrepreneurship, population, people coming to the Internet. But what how quickly they're able to adopt the tools on the Internet and get a presence up and running, I think you'll continue to see good momentum in that because technology and generative AI now are going to make a real difference. No, I can't believe you said table stakes for a digital guide, but let me take your first question first. You surprise me with that. Let's start with the macro. There are a few items that sort of we look at on our dashboard or the leaders in our organization look at when we look at macro and I'll try to touch on a couple of them to give you a bit of color. One of them that we look at is sort of nonbrand demand that's coming to Google as a representation of demand. And are people going out and searching for things? And they're not searching for a particular company, they're just searching for a website, they're just searching for a domain and how is that trending? And what we saw in that data is that there are a few markets in the world and actually the English-speaking markets where we are strong, the U.K. being one of them, we see a good lift in nonbrand demand for the terms that we track. And that's a positive sign for those markets. That means we expect better demand. We expect to spend more money there. And generally, the customer, the everyday entrepreneur is feeling better and wants to engage and buy a domain, start a business or build their business, or so on.  The second group geographically I'll talk about is the markets that are not big English-speaking markets, but what we call the rest of the world. And there, what we see is sort of more similar or flattish behavior in terms of nonbrand searches, those -- as you can see, the international market does really well for us. So, that's been phenomenal. GoDaddy has done a lot to take share globally on those. But in terms of raw demand or macro, what we see is much, much more time sort of behavior. And the U.S. is somewhere a little bit in the middle. I won't comment sort of broad macro on the U.S. of you understand it better than I probably do. But Rod, if I talk about demand on the terms that we track to, there's some good news, but not as good as a couple of the other markets. And the second data point to look at is customer -- consumer confidence, and we track that for all of our main markets. And what we see there, again, is sort of an expectation for many of that confidence would go down, and it was probably trending down in some of those markets, but over the last two months, three months, a little bit of a reversal. So, maybe instead of going down towards, we see more flat. But in some markets, and again, I'll mention the U.K., you actually see it coming off, which I think you didn't expect if you're just sort of a macro person. And there are other markets that are sort of showing different behavior as well.  But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on a couple of the core metrics that we look at and a couple of sort of a little bit of a geographic lens on it. In terms of the digital guide, which I think was a second question, I just want to reiterate the digital guide is a technology built using AI that uses generative AI to generate content that uses AI for a lot of other purposes. And our goal is to couple that with every domain in purchase. So, when you buy a domain, a digital guy is automatically enabled for that customer. And what it's trying to do is find that best experience and path for that particular customer and get them through that path, whether it's adding new products, whether it's posting something, whether it's reminding them or something. And it's not trying to do it in a way that says, \"Hey, come buy this from me. What it's doing is it's actually doing the work for the customer in advance and then say, take a look. If you like this, we can keep that, right? So, I don't think of that as stable stakes at all.  If I look at -- and I'm not even talking about our industry, if I look at sort of across the technology landscape. Of course, there are technologies out there and a lot of people want to do similar things. But I don't see anyone starting at the point of a domain name. And we have AI or generative AI-ready capabilities. We're already testing many of these things. And I think in the past, I've talked about them. or last quarter, I mentioned one or two of them. But we have capabilities that are live today that are being tested with customers. And there isn't anyone else that's going to bring it to millions of the main names and set people off the way we want to start right. So, that's the big thing. And I guess, for folks that may have joined just a minute or two late. There was a great little video that we started with today, and I assume we've posted somewhere I'm pointing to one. I assume we post it, it's that two-minute video is a great way for you to understand what our -- what we want to our customers to experience. And how much effort we are taking away from the customer that one customer would have to do and letting the digital guy do that. And believe it or not, that happens today in care right now. Customers call us and what they want is that they want us to give them confidence, and they want us to encourage them. And at the same time, they want us to solve their problems and give them access to more tools.  And we do all of that -- and we're trying to take the learning that we have in care and enable every customer with it so that we can scale to literally every customer that buys with us. And the temperature is much cooler in November. Yes. Let me take the domains piece first. And then, Mark, if you want to touch on the pricing or I can touch on that to Peter. On the Google domain space, the way we look at it, Navid, is that anytime there's a transition like this, there's a disruption in the customer experience or flow. Customers tend to put their heads up and they'll look at what other options might exist for them.  And given our brand awareness and leadership position in the world of domains, given the care we provide given our high transactional NPS, and just sort of broad understanding from a very large number of people what GoDaddy brings to the table. And the more we attach to that bundle with that domain, I think we're positioned very well to see if some disruption happens that we're there and it's advantageous to us, right? In terms of beyond. But I think our goal is to just do a fantastic job delivering, providing customer's great products. And we think we're doing a good job at attracting customers, we're growing down. And I mean, maybe the way to say it is we were the leader in the mains when Google came into the business and we're a leader in domains when Google is leading the business. So, we're okay with that. And then on the AMC pricing, I assume the question is to website plus marketing pricing? I think. Thank you, Christie, and I'll just end by thanking all the GoDaddy employees for another good quarter. And just to remind all of our Anderson shareholders where -- we're super excited about the products we're bringing to market. We're super excited about attaching into our base that we've demonstrated with e-mail and are demonstrating with commerce now. We're super excited about the trajectory we have going into Q3 and Q4. Ending the year at accelerating growth and strong margin, setting up next year really well. I look forward to the next call. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. In just the last few years, GoDaddy, successfully built a growing competitive and robust set of tools and services, including our websites plus marketing product and OmniCommerce solution at a one-stop shop, empowering entrepreneurs to build and manage their ventures and accept payments with a dedicated partner by their side. The product innovation and targeted investment over this period has led to a better suite of products. And with our soon-to-be launched GoDaddy digital guide, we will provide an even further differentiated experience for our customers. propelling long-term growth for GoDaddy through faster product attachment and stronger retention.  As we consider the many headwinds we faced in the first half of the year, we are thrilled with the continued momentum of our applications in commerce revenue and the acceleration in our Create & Grow solutions. Our durable model continues to generate free cash flow, and we expect to reaccelerate our growth and improve our profitability as we exit the year while delivering on our cash flow targets. Moving to our financial results. Our applications and commerce revenue grew to $352 million, up 11%, surpassing our guide of 8% to 10% and delivering a segment EBITDA margin of 41%. The strength in our Applications & Commerce segment is fueled by our create gross solutions, which accelerated to $465 billion in ARR, up 11%. Additionally, we drove rapid growth in GPV comparable to last quarter, and we are on pace to more than double the 2022 exit rate by the end of the year. as we continue to attract and convert customers within our 21 million base to GoDaddy payments. ARR for applications and commerce grew 10% to more than $1.3 billion. with a 20% growth in annualized GMV to over $33 billion. Core platform revenue totaled $696 million, flat year-over-year with a segment EBITDA margin of 27%. ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion. Core platform revenue was supported by 3% growth in domains on stronger customer additions from higher demand and price increases. This was primarily offset by greater-than-expected declines in our aftermarket on aftermarket. Revenue decreased 5% to $101 million on a tough compare from last year. Over the last five years, we've built upwards of a $400 million revenue two-sided marketplace. As a reminder, this business allows a buyer and seller to transact on our platform at their agreed upon valuation. This business rapidly grew as we scaled the operations, participants, and partnerships. What we see now is a post-COVID normalization of this business as valuation of larger transactions have decreased and volume growth has slowed. With that, we expect steady low to mid-single-digit top-line growth for the business on a go-forward basis. On our core platform restructuring initiative, we completed the migration of Media Temple and Main Street Hub customers to the GoDaddy technology stack. And the 123 Reg migration is planned to be completed by the end of the year. As expected, these migrations produce a slightly elevated churn on these brands this quarter, but will deliver further cost efficiencies in the future. The retention rate of customers for the GoDaddy branded products remains above 85%.  Total revenue grew to $1.05 billion up 3% on a reported basis and 4% excluding aftermarket. Constant currency revenue increased 4%. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 3% on a reported basis. and 6% on a constant currency basis. Our ARPU grew 3% to $199 from $193 last year, and we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers despite the headwinds from our migration efforts.  Normalized EBITDA grew 2% set to $265 million, while delivering a margin of 25%. Bookings totaled $1.1 billion, growing 2% on a reported basis. and 4%, excluding aftermarket and the impact of the integration of non-core assets. Bookings grew 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of aftermarket, the drivers of growth in bookings were strong customer additions and price increases in domains as well as strong attach in applications and commerce. We expect these factors to contribute to accelerated revenue growth next year.  Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $284 million, growing 3%. While free cash flow was relatively flat at $240 million despite increased interest-related payments. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.44 on a trailing 12-month basis. versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.67, a 14% increase driven by execution, operating leverage, and share repurchases.  Through July 31, we repurchased 10.2 million shares year-to-date, totaling $746 million, of which $632 million was repurchased since the end of Q1. This brings the cumulative share repurchase under the current authorization to $2 billion and 27.1 million shares, reducing shares outstanding since the inception of this authorization by 16% and we remain on part for our commitment to reduce our fully diluted shares outstanding by 15% to 20% over the three-year period.  Additionally, today, we announced an incremental $1 billion share buyback authorization to bring the total authorization to $4 billion and extending the program out to 2025. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $583 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt stands at $3.3 billion with a 2.9 times net leverage within our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times. Lastly, we secured a 75-basis point interest rate reduction on $1.8 billion of outstanding principal through a refinance issued at par. This refinance is expected to save $13 million annually in interest payments for each of the next seven years. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q3 total revenue in the range of $1.055 billion to $1.075 billion, representing growth of 3% at the midpoint. With the current momentum, we expect to exit the year at approximately 7% top-line growth with a normalized EBITDA of 28%, an increase of 300 basis points from our 2021 exit rate of 25%. We are increasing our growth expectations for applications and commerce to be between 9% and 11% for Q3 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to be flat in Q3 and reaccelerate in the fourth quarter to deliver 1% growth for the full year.  Q3 Normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve to approximately 26% with continued acceleration over the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 26%. This is a 300-basis point increase from our 2021 rate of 23% on better operating leverage from improved marketing performance, restructuring efforts benefits from our continued move of loads to cloud and the incorporation of AI into our operating model. On the growth bridge we spoke about last quarter, we remain confident in the path to accelerated revenue growth. While expanding margins and improving cash flows.  As a reminder, this year's revenue growth rate includes approximately two points of FX pressure from last year's bookings. Difficult compares in our aftermarket business and the migration and divested certain non-core assets. We expect momentum in bookings in the second half of the year to drive the reacceleration of revenue growth as we exit the year while we remain committed to delivering our margin expansion and free cash flow targets.  We will be posting our annual investor dinner with product demonstrations in November at our Planning and Investor Day in Q1 '2024, we consider both a great opportunity to share more about our exciting initiatives in AI and our outlook for the next three years. In closing, we remain confident in our ability to execute in the areas of our business within our control and deliver the full-year targets. As always, we remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities, committed to being responsible stewards of capital, and strive every day to provide a one-stop shop to micro businesses, along their entrepreneurial journey with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team to open the call all for questions. Yes. Thanks, Matt. When we look at Q2 and bookings and kind of trade off in the second half of the year, a couple of things to consider: one, -- we have FX that will be abating. We have pricing increases that we did towards the end of the quarter, which should help with our bookings and somewhat revenue into this year. Obviously, the aftermarket compares get better going into Q4. And now that we've completed some of our migrations to the core GoDaddy stack, we should see start -- some of those start to abate as we get through the half year.  So that gives us the confidence that we will have that accelerating growth rate as we get through the remainder of this year. That, coupled with some of the demand we're seeing at the front of the funnel with customers coming in, attaching new products faster. Our retention rates remaining strong and the momentum we have in application commerce, we feel good about that momentum coming out of Q4 and going into 2024. I'll start with the application commerce. We can continue to -- sorry, we continue to see strong momentum in the front of the tunnel and customer bundling payments and choosing payments are coming through with websites really happy and excited about that attach and that bundling that's happening at the front of the funnel. Again, I alluded to, we have really strong net gross customer adds coming in and they're getting to that bundled product quicker with that, that gets us to higher retention rates. That, coupled with some pricing increases we're doing at the back half of Q2, where we did at the back half of Q2 should start to show up in applications and comments as we go.  Also seeing great momentum on the conversion. We've talked about it previously, but our existing customers converting over to the GoDaddy payments. That motion is well in work, and we're seeing that AGV grow as we go out throughout the year. On the margin expansion, we had about 25%. We're forecasting to get up 28%. We have a couple of things going on there. We're seeing greater marketing efficiency, which is helping us. We are really starting to see the benefits of moving into the cloud. We're seeing the cost efficiencies that are coming with more workloads and that are really starting to take hold as we hit certain milestones throughout the year.  We also had the restructuring in Q2. And some of that will gain steam as we go into the back half of the year and overall momentum as we go through there. So, we have a lot of, I would say, moving parts that are all pointing in the same direction that make us feel good about expanding our margins while expanding our growth rate as well through applications of coverage. Thanks, Trevor. I'll start with the aftermarket and the core platform. We really saw underperformed this quarter. We've grown a $400 million business there over a number of years. We saw a lot of growth back half of '21 coming into '22. So, no doubt we have compares. But as we've talked previously, the larger transactions and the valuations on them have abated. We're seeing the volumes slowing growth as well coming on Q2. And to put it in perspective, we're seeing great demand and gross ads within our funnel, but it seems the valuations on the aftermarket still are connecting with the buyers.  So, we're seeing them lean towards the domain growth. And we think this is a normalization for now. I think we -- we've taken it out of our back half of the year expectations, and we think this is going to be a low to mid-single-digit growth business going forward. So, I would really point to the aftermarket on this as being part. Yes. Naved, thanks. We're excited on our Investor Day coming up in the first quarter, and we'll get more into the details of what we'll look like. We're really excited about our margin expansion going into Q4, the 28%, if we look back to the Q4 in 2021, we've increased our margins by 300 basis points. Even year-over-year, we get to the same 300 basis points. So, it's something we continue to work on. We continue to find efficiencies in our operation, and we'll continue to push margin growth going into 2024. At the same time, we're accelerating revenue and hitting our cash flow objectives well.  So, I don't want to give you too much of a leading what 2024 is going to look like, but we're really excited about our progress, the work we've done in the first half of the year and how that's going to benefit us in the back half of the year and then ultimately into 2024. Yes. Thanks. And try not to peg a specific timetable here as we're getting into the back half of the year. We'll talk more about it later. But when we look at the full-year guide this year and we kind of look at the impact of FX, the difficult aftermarket compares and migrations and divestitures we're doing -- they will start to abate into the fourth quarter and continue to abate and turn into tailwinds as we go through 2024. Not trying to pick a quarter on anything right now. We'll talk more about that later in the year. But the momentum has us accelerating revenue as we go through units. And if I could just add to that and to clarify, we -- while we look out in '24, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023 in the range for revenue just FYI [ph]. And we'd always said the impact on 2024 was -- sorry, 2023 is going to be minimal, and we would start to see the momentum of that going into 2024, which again adds very excitement about that momentum. Yes. And I'll add on applications comments in general, where we're really excited is strong gross customer adds are coming in and coming stronger than we've seen in a long time. Not only are they coming into the funnel, they are getting to that second product -- and whether it's payable domains, whether it's payments, whether it's commerce, whether it's wet like marketing, they're bundling those together at the initial stages. We think the digital guide will also accelerate that as that starts to at faster rate.  But when that happens, when like man said, when we get to that second product, that third product, we get to a third product attached, generally, we find we have a customer for life, and that really drives the all this because the decisions around it are being made faster on the top of the funnel, help us get there faster and drive that LTV equation. Obviously, it helps to -- with our cash flow, and it helps us be more efficient because we're getting greater revenue prices or getting better revenue and a better efficient operating margin as well.  So, we feel really good about all that happening in the applications and commerce. It's really driving a lot of momentum. We have that on top of the hardware sales that we are seeing that are driving that momentum as well, a lot of positivity coming right? And it all starts with the domain and innovating in the demand. Yes. And I'll just add to that. What we really like about the gross ads coming in is they are customers that have a higher propensity to want to do business and therefore, are attaching a lot faster. And on the churn on the other hand, we are losing the migration and lifting of some of these products. But that relates to what we refer to as [indiscernible] customers that weren't growing the business for necessarily using the functionality. And therefore, we're trading in a good direction as we get to those net ads. I'll add one of the distinctions we have is from identity to presence, to commerce, we have the entire technology set. So, when we use generative AI, we could take it across their entire journey, and we start with the domain, and that makes that journey faster gets us the bundling faster, gets us to customers for life for us, and driving LTV into our financials. So, we're really excited about it. But one of the great distinctions is we have the entire technology stack around it to use they are around. Yes. I don't think we've gotten into the magnitude of breaking down pricing by each of the different components of it. I'll give it a little color. I think last year, we focused mostly on pricing increases around renewals. This year, we're doing it on new as well as renewals. So, I would say than we did last year. Obviously, our priority is always retention rates in sticking with -- but we took those pricing increases at the end of Q2, and we should start to see them materialize as we go throughout the year. Thanks, Navid."

GoDaddy's mission is to empower entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. We learn from our customers every day and they are a resilient group and they value what GoDaddy brings to them. While many worry about a recession, our venture forward service found that our customers are noticeably more optimistic today about the future of their business than they were six months ago. One customer we showcased in the past is the Furlough Cheesecake founded by two sisters impacted by a government furlough. In a recent interview, one of them commented, with partners like GoDaddy we can manage our business from anywhere. GoDaddy helped us launch our business quickly from idea to up and running in one week because they had the tools in place. GoDaddy's unique combination of seamless intuitive technology and best-in-class human and digital guidance creates the ease of use that our customers want and need so they can focus on their business. This combination continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, helping us drive profitable growth and superb cash flow. We serve 21 million customers that have a high retention rate of 85%. In Q1, we drove double-digit growth of 12% in our Applications and Commerce segment supported by 10% ARR growth in our Create and Grow products. Additionally, we surpassed $1 billion in annualized GPV for GoDaddy payments. One area we continue to watch carefully is our aftermarket business. We faced tough compares last quarter and a continued unevenness in flow of large deals that we believe is impacted by broader macro headwinds. Overall, we are pleased with our Q1 results and encouraged by the positive momentum over the quarter, especially in our Subscription and Commerce businesses. Our strategic priorities remain consistent and our teams continue to launch experiments and new experiences at a fast pace. As always, I will review each of our priorities. For our first priority, driving Commerce through presence, we are happy to share that we gained exciting traction in our Commerce offerings. We had our best quarter yet, attracting sellers, more than we anticipated and rapidly crossed over the $1 billion of annualized GPV. The largest opportunity for us remains our existing base, of 21 million customers and the many sellers that are already a part of it. The efficient motion of selling into our existing customer base, was the primary contributor to our GPV growth. And hence, it remains our focus as we work to scale this sales team. Adopting our commerce product, paves the way for customers to deepen the relationship with us, which results in higher retention and increased lifetime value. Last month, we also launched Apple's contactless Tap to Pay technology, within our GoDaddy app. As you know, Tap to Pay allows our customers to accept all types of contactless in-person payments, with only an iPhone just by tapping their credit card, mobile wallet or watch. We worked directly with Apple, to integrate this technology natively, creating a seamless, best-in-class, low-friction sign of experience for our app customers. We also made several other improvements to make websites plus marketing a more robust solution, for sellers including improved pay buttons, and new reports for merchants to help them prepare their taxes and understand their fees and payouts. Our teams are also excited about, how generative AI can add ease of use for customers, by auto populating content for them and helping them create natural language, e-mails, chat and text messages, they engage with their customers. AI-powered tools are showing up across multiple experiences at GoDaddy. For example, we built instant video features in our Studios app and use cases like auto generating product descriptions, are coming soon. As always, we are focused on both technology tools and guidance for our customers. As our customers start exploring generative AI, we want to help them by launching a growing area of resources so our small business owners can begin harnessing, its power to save time and grow their sales. For example, we now provide an essential small business guide [indiscernible] library. We are also working to bring these capabilities together, in a manner that even the smallest businesses can benefit from instantaneously accessing vast amounts of data and transforming it into something meaningful for their business. Websites + Marketing continues to be rated, as the highest-performing website builder according to Google Core, Web vitals and it is taking share in the marketplace. The team continues to focus on making it easy for customers, to build high-performance websites quickly. On our second priority, delivering for GoDaddy Pro. Our goal is to make them better serve their clients and grow their businesses. GoDaddy Pro\u2019s value, platform capabilities like performance, availability and security, but also automation, support, ease of use and value-added offers. Our new managed WooCommerce store offering replaced our old managed WordPress Commerce offering, over the last few weeks. With this new product in place, we are bringing many more capabilities to the table and we'll be able to test into higher-priced SKUs. On our Hosting business, our focus is around stabilization and simplification. As discussed previously, we are on course to integrate brands more deeply which includes retiring the Media Temple brand with the final migration of customers to the GoDaddy full stack. In April, we also signed an agreement to exit a couple of our smaller European brands. Our goal remains to provide customers with a higher level of service at a lower cost to serve while sharpening our focus. On our third priority innovation in domains. We have continued to broaden our bundling offers for new and existing customers, while our initial focus was around bundling e-mail, we have increased experimentation velocity and are doing much more here. We are improving the onboarding flow for customers with the target of higher attach and encouraged by the results we have seen. This matters because we know that customers who activate and attach more products have higher retention rates. And we continue to be excited about payable domains and have two clear insights since our launch: first customers who adopt this product are demonstrating their satisfaction by quickly doing a significant number of transactions through the default tailing we provide. Our initial efforts to drive more traffic to this product resulted in impressive early GPV. Second, we noticed that existing customers are more ready to use this product compared to potential customers who are new to purchasing a domain. We are currently focused on creating more opportunities for both existing and new domain customers to discover and utilize payable domains. Although there is still work to be done, we strongly believe in the enormous potential of this offering. On the aftermarket, you will remember our List for Sale feature that allows GoDaddy customers to list their domain in the aftermarket. This quarter we extended this capability to our registrar partners, opening a channel to bring more inventory to the aftermarket. We've also added new features to the customer experience for brokered aftermarket transactions. We built a new lead center giving real-time status updates to the leads being pursued on behalf of domain sellers so they can have more visibility into progress on their transactions. Our aftermarket business continues to innovate and create value for our customers and all players in the industry. At GoDaddy, we are eager to help small businesses thrive. This fuels us to create better products that deliver greater value for our customers which drives our attractive financial model that then translates into sustained customer and shareholder value. This is the simple approach of how we work to grow GoDaddy and differentiate our offerings. We are proud of the consistency of our strong execution and our strategy. We have a great business with a loyal and growing customer base that continues to spend more time. With us through our strong competitive advantages and attractive financial profile GoDaddy is well positioned to continue to grow and deliver for all stakeholders in meaningful ways. With that here's Mark. \nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. Before getting into the detailed results, I wanted to summarize a few key points. First, we are making progress towards returning to double-digit growth while executing our three year plan to expand our operating margins and deliver on our free cash flow per share targets; second, we are delivering on our applications and Commerce segment growth through increases in new customers and the conversion of our existing customers to our payments platform in the US.; lastly, we are on target to complete our restructuring action in the second quarter, driving better operating leverage in our core platform segment and improving our overall operating margin in the second half of the year. With that, Applications & Commerce revenue grew to $338 million up 12%, exceeding our guide of 8% to 10%. Additionally, the normalized EBITDA margin for Applications & Commerce was 39%. Taken together, this highlights the impressive performance we are driving in this business which delivered ARR for Create and Grow of $450 million, up 10% and over $1 billion of GPV. This segment is our largest opportunity to drive growth through the attachment of our Create and Grow products, Commerce platform and productivity solutions for both new and existing customers. ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 9% to more than $1.3 billion. Annualized GMV, across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 18% to approximately $28 billion. Our core platform segment which includes Domains, Hosting and Security continues to serve as an important on-ramp to our overall business. Core Platform revenue was $698 million with an ARR of $2.2 billion and a strong normalized EBITDA margin of 27%. Core Platform revenue was supported by a 5% growth in domains from a combination of new customer adds, attach and price increases on renewals. This was offset by tough compares for our aftermarket business as well as the continued uneven flow of large transactions. Additionally, there are modest impacts to our hosting revenue and customer count from migration of non-core hosting platforms being sunset. Total revenue, grew to $1.04 billion up 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a sequential lift from the Q4 growth rate. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Q1 bookings grew faster than revenue at a rate of 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, totaling $1.2 billion. Bookings growth on our subscription products outpaced the related revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points. Our durable model continues to generate cash flow through our strong customer relationships and cohort performance, highlighted by our customer retention rate of 85%. We build on this strength through intentionally focusing our marketing on attracting high-intent customers that stay with GoDaddy and spend more. This quarter, we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers, despite headwinds from our migration efforts noted above. Our ARPU grew 4% to $197 from $190 last year. Normalized EBITDA grew 11% to $250 million with a margin of 24%, representing approximately 160 basis points expansion. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage through strong execution and our restructuring efforts. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $304 million, growing 6% driven by strong profitability, while free cash flow remained flat at $259 million, despite an increase in our cash interest expense due to the refinancing of our term debt in Q4 2022. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.19 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.25, an 18% increase driven by execution, operating leverage and share repurchases. Additionally, in Q1 we completed $114 million of share buybacks, repurchasing 1.6 million shares. This brings the cumulative share repurchase under our $3 billion authorization to $1.4 billion and 18.4 million shares reducing shares outstanding since inception by 11%. We remain on target for our commitment to reduce our fully diluted shares outstanding by 15% to 20% over the three-year period. On the balance sheet we finished Q1 with $892 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.9 billion. Net debt stands at $3 billion with 2.7 times net leverage within our targeted range of two to four times. Lastly as noted above we signed an agreement to divest certain non-core hosting assets which is expected to close by Q3. Our restructuring charge of $50 million in the quarter included $21 million of a non-cash impairment charge for these assets. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q2 total revenue in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.065 billion, representing growth of 4% at the midpoint. With the current momentum, we expect to exit the year at approximately 7% top line growth with a normalized EBITDA of 28%. We expect applications and Commerce segment growth to be between 8% and 10% for both Q2 and the full year. For core platform, we expect revenue growth 1% to 3% in Q2 and accelerate in the back half of the year to deliver between 2% and 4% for the full year. Q2 normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve to approximately 25% with continued acceleration over the back half of the year to deliver full year normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 26%, showing improved operating leverage from the actions previously discussed. I would like to spend a moment bridging our expected 2023 revenue growth to what we believe our strategy and model can produce going forward. Our current guide for the full year is 5% revenue growth at the midpoint. As a reminder, this year's revenue growth rate includes approximately two points of FX pressure from last year's bookings and is also impacted by difficult compares in our aftermarket business and the divestiture of certain non-core revenue-generating assets. Looking ahead to next year and beyond, absent those negative impacts and with the momentum we are driving through the strategic initiatives Aman spoke about earlier including ARPU expansion, even with the continuation of the current macro environment there is a path to returning to double-digit top line growth, while remaining committed to delivering our margin expansion and free cash flow targets. We remain disciplined in how and where we spend with a focus on controlling our costs, optimize our marketing spend, monitoring headcount and investing in innovation so that we can strike the right balance between capturing attractive opportunities with delivering value to our shareholders always with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. In closing, we have strong confidence in our ability to execute and accelerate our growth. We believe our competitive position and strategic advantages, our diverse product offerings, our strong balance sheet and the consistent and predictable cash flow we generate will position GoDaddy as a leader amongst its peers. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We remain focused on execution against our strategic priorities responsibly managing our business and building deeper customer relationships as we partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. With that we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. \nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First wanted to understand the potential acceleration next year a little bit better. So if we look at the business absent those three headwinds that you cited do we need an acceleration in that business in order to get to double-digits, or is just a normalization of those three headwinds sort of enough to get us there?\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks Matt. I'll handle the first part of that and it sounds like you have a second question too. So on the bridge we do see I would say easier comps on things like aftermarket coming into the second half of the year which will start to serve as a tailwind. So normalizing the core platform segment growth obviously is in the cards as it turns around into easy year compares in that end of it. Domains is growing at a good pace. And obviously we're taking some actions on hosting which will act as a headwind in the back half of the year but turn into a tailwind as well next year. So a lot of positive momentum. Obviously applications and commerce continues to be the higher growing segment for us. We're seeing a lot of traction on commerce. And we've talked about the four pillars there and then being in the market and we're really happy with the performance of those. So the ability to bridge to what we see as a path to that double-digit growth we've talked about we think starts to take that momentum in 2024. \nAman Bhutani: Yes. And maybe I'll just add Mark, Matt that we see of course the headwinds away but we also have good momentum in the business. Mark already mentioned the growth in AMC, but also the domains business has done well and demand has been better and improving. So we're very sort of encouraged by the momentum and that's what we're really talking about. \nMatt Pfau: Great. And then just wanted to ask a follow-up on gross margins. It dipped sequentially in the quarter. I'm guessing that's probably due to payments. So is that true? And how should we think about that trend throughout the year as presumably payments continues to gain traction? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. No doubt Matt that we've talked about that product mix will impact our gross margin. And we're focusing on operating margin as we run the business and expansion of that. But as we get into more of the transactional businesses we can continue to see pressure on the gross margin, but be in that 60 -- low 60s to mid-60s range. As it scales it becomes more accretive. Obviously we get the leverage on the operating margin and it'll help us deliver on our normalized EBITDA.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Matt.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. Just first one Mark. On the 1Q segment results core platform a bit below guide and A&C a bit ahead, on either of these, could you maybe speak to which areas drove relative under or outperformance specific versus your expectations? And then, on repurchases in the quarter, a bit below run rate over the prior three quarters and a bit below what you'd expect given the $1 billion guide. Realized capital allocation strategy was reiterated here, but just wondering if there was something that gave you pause on those repurchases such as macro or just a conscious effort to kind of bolster cash on hand a bit? Any color there would be appreciated.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Trevor. On core platform, aftermarket and the larger transactions continues to be the area that is uneven for us and becoming difficult to predict. We saw some strength as we were exiting the quarter, but it continues to be uneven and that pretty much drove our underperformance. So a moderate impact from some of the actions we were taking on integrating the non-core hosting platforms, but I would say aftermarket was probably the area of putting us below the original range. On application and commerce, the AGV is ahead of what we -- at a great rate. We're seeing a lot of conversion of our existing customer base which is driving the GPV including new customers signing on. So we're really pleased with the momentum there. Really pleased with the attach we're getting around the websites related to our commerce SKUs. So all that has got great momentum in the quarter. We also saw the benefit of the stickiness of -- as our customers and the applications with commerce are adding more than one product, the retention rates are improving. We've always seen that trend and now we're seeing it more in Q1 with commerce. And with that, we're issuing less refunds and that helped us in the quarter as well that we didn't have to. We're seeing that stickiness start to take place. So we're seeing between the two segments, I would say, as we're integrating the core hosting assets, we are seeing some headwinds around retention of, what I would say, customers with more in the area of one product, but we are seeing a pickup in A&C of the customers with multiple products and multiple services, which is helping us. On capital allocation -- sorry, I almost forgot there was two parts to that. Nothing to call out. We are ahead of schedule at the end of the year. We came into the year with the $1 billion target that hasn't changed. There hasn't been any changes to our capital allocation strategy. And I would still put in there a target of $1 billion for the year.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks, Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Trevor.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of John Byun from Jefferies on for Brent Thill. John, please go ahead.\nAman Bhutani: John?\nChristie Masoner: Hi, John. You might be -- I think you\u2019re still muted.\nJohn Byun: Okay. I think it was double muted. Thank you very much. So good sequential improvement in GPV from Q4 from $760 million to $1 billion. Wondering, in terms of the driver, was there anything more besides I guess the existing base converting pretty well? And for existing customers, would those be switching from other payment solutions? And if so, how do you convince them to do so other than for pricing?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, John thanks for that question. Mark has talked about the pillars of revenue for Commerce. And we actually saw goodness across all of them. But selling into our existing base of customers was the largest driver of this acceleration and growth and we continue to be very excited about it. In terms of how that sales cycle works, our customers have a fantastic relationship with GoDaddy. And we're bringing not just sort of the surprise and delight element of hey you have this relationship with GoDaddy and we have more to offer, we also have great pricing for them. So, when you put together the relationship all the basket of sort of one-stop shop and the pricing that leads to them switching over from other folks. And we -- this is -- of course, we're excited about payable domains and that did its part and resellers did its part. And everyone -- every piece helped, but the prime focus for us is selling into our base. We're seeing goodness there. We're going to keep attacking that. And from what we can see it seems to be a bit of a unique competitive advantage for GoDaddy because of the relationships we have. So, we absolutely are continuing on path on that. \nJohn Byun: Great. Thank you. And maybe one follow-up. On the GMV it was flat quarter-to-quarter. I don't know if there was how that was versus your expectation whether you expected any seasonality or just increase from continued adoption? \nAman Bhutani: Yes. GMV as a whole if you remember is the broader sort of set of customers we have also inherited from Poynt and it tends to follow seasonality of the business Q4 versus Q1 and nothing new to sort of report that. \nJohn Byun: Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks John.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clark please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello, thanks for taking the question. First one I think it's for Mark I was hoping you could maybe give us some color on that exit rate of 28% EBITDA margins. How we might be able to think about that between the two segments kind of footing the disclosures you gave on A&C core platform and overhead? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks Clarke. So, yes 28%. And we talked about the actions we're taking in the first half that will help benefit as we get through the second half of the year and obviously exit the year at a strong run rate there of 7% and 28% of normalized EBITDA margins. A good way to look at it is as we're going through the core platform actions that we've taken around the restructuring and the integration of those platforms into the GoDaddy technology stack. There is going to be some pressure on our retention rates. And we're seeing customers that don't have a higher propensity to spend with us are making that decision as we're doing the transfer over to the GoDaddy stack. On the flip side, the -- being on the GoDaddy stack and having applications and commerce -- and Commerce and our ability for our care guys to engage our customers at a better level is really showing that we're getting more customers signing on to more than one product right now, which again pushes our retention rates higher, pushes our ARPU higher. We're seeing a lot of benefit of that. And A&C comes at a higher margin. So, we're in essence gaining more customers at the higher margin level while we're seeing pressure on the core platform. Those are the lower margin or lower calorie customers I would say. And therefore we're seeing the benefit of the mix start to improve and help us get momentum into the future years into 2024. So, hopefully, that helps kind of how we're looking at it.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. And maybe just very quickly Clarke if I can add. If you look at items like marketing spend, obviously, I've talked about it a lot over the last couple of years, but we continue to sort of make our ability to measure return on ad spend better and better globally. And what we're seeing is good gross ads good demand coming to the site and the lowest marketing spend sort of as a percentage of revenue that we've had in a while. So obviously, that continues to help us as well apart from sort of the actions that Mark talked about which are more on the people side.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. And then just one follow-up. I know you've mentioned a couple of times the aftermarket. I just kind of want to be clear on compared to the guide for core platform is where the result came in compared to the guide maybe either at the midpoint or the low point completely describable by aftermarket, or were there any other factors maybe accelerated movement in the hosting segment that might have also been a contributor there? Helping to clarify that would be great. \nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. You just called it. I think the primary driver was aftermarket and the continued absence of the large transactions. Just as a reminder, we don't set the prices in the aftermarket. That's a buyer and seller agreement and we kind of facilitate the transaction between two. So we're still seeing that disconnect in the market related to the buyer and seller agreeing which shows up in the larger transactions. So it's primarily the cause of the core platform missing the guide. There is a little bit on the hosting no doubt. I don't want to say it's 100% because there is some as we are migrating some of the noncore assets into the GoDaddy technology stack we have seen some pressure there. But I would say aftermarket was primary.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead.\nAaron Kessler: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. Maybe just first on the macro, I mean outside of aftermarket can you just maybe talk to the top of the funnel traffic you're seeing kind of gross sub additions? And then just how should we think maybe about the ARPU outlook for 2023? Should we think about it similar to Q1? And just maybe talk about the adoption of higher ASP solutions that you're seeing as well? Thank you.\nAmanpal Bhutani: Yeah. Thanks Aaron. Maybe I'll just take the top of the funnel and Mark if you want to touch on ARPU. So like I started to say earlier top of the funnel I think we see good demand year-over-year. We see good gross adds and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing and as we had talked about last quarter as well a bit the momentum seemed to improve through the quarter. So our customers by just nature tend to be resilient and tend to be a creative group. So and we serve them like I talked about as well all, but it does seem to be showing up in the numbers to a good extent as well. So we remain optimistic about the rest of the year. And of course we'll keep you updated on it with Mark on ARPU. \nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And I'll start with we don't guide towards ARPU, but looking at the outlook for the year when we think about our goal to attract customers with a higher intent to spend with us our goal is to raise that ARPU number. What we're seeing around the commerce is obviously giving us that momentum that we believe we'll be able to continue to drive that. Q4 to Q1 is a normal pattern for us. I know we haven't gone into quarterly disclosures of ARPU in a while, but based on our billing cycles and bookings happening earlier in the process and in the year that revenue from the bookings will flow through to our ARPU as it rolls out in our subscription business. So it will be a natural benefit that we will start to see. So we're excited about attracting more customers with higher intent. We're seeing that especially in the commerce area, which showed up in Q1. The momentum there has been really, really good and we continue to be driving towards adding that ARPU as we go throughout the year. \nAman Bhutani: And we can \u2013 those two thoughts together with bookings growing faster than revenue both those pieces basically come together.\nAaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. [indiscernible] on the line from Elizabeth's team. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the regional banking crisis. We've seen in some of the senior loan officer surveys that are pointing to tougher requirements to get loans. How important is this financing channel for your target customer base? Are you seeing any impact today? And what is incorporated into your outlook? \nAman Bhutani: I think from two views, one from our customer's view I think the challenges in the financial banking crisis have not had a significant impact for our customers. I would remind you that many of our customers are micro businesses and they don't even access to banking services or capital and they really are a very creative group. And for our business as a whole obviously, we're not dependent on SVB or sort of risks that come close to the regional banking places. I don't know Mark if \u2013 what you would add? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes, it's a good inquiry. When you think about our ARPU at $197 and the cost of that to our customers and the value that we provide to them in new business, not a real impact there. Even when you talk about the FDIC limits and all that and the micro businesses and entrepreneurs, we think our customers are optimistic and we're seeing them eager to sell in the marketplace but we're not seeing any limitations based on the banking prices.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you for the question.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Good evening. Just a couple of quick ones. Your A&C revenue guide for this year ,it looks like potentially a modest sequential decline if you look on a two-year stack basis throughout the year. So I'm just curious with new products coming to \u2013 does the market an infancy there, what that might be attributed to? And related if you can maybe speak to the attachment rates you're seeing early on with your OmniCommerce rollout and whether there are any initial demand signals that you'd like to share? And then last on the 2Q and annual revenue growth guides, if there's any material contribution from payables \u2013 payable domains and then and also from Worldpay? Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Okay. So I'm going to hand \u2013 there was a few things in there Mark. So I'm going to try to go through them sequentially. If I miss anything, please point it out. A&C revenue guide, we are really excited about the 12% in Q1, showing great momentum coming into the year. We talked about it. This is the first quarter in which we had all four pillars in market. And that we've been engaging our customers converting our existing customer base in the US and just unbelievable traction. And we're also seeing play out is that the stickiness of going from the one to the two to the three products is playing out and improving \u2013 I want to say improving our refunds but lowering our refunds to our customers. So we saw a benefit of that in Q1. We are early stage though. So we \u2013 it's one quarter in and we like the momentum. We'll see how it rolls out throughout the year but we feel excited about the ability to continue that momentum throughout the year and into 2024. I think on the attach of the OmniCommerce, Aman, do you want to talk about it? \nAman Bhutani: Maybe, I'll just talk about attach more broadly real quick and then get into OmniCommerce as well. We talked about bundling a little bit. And as Mark said bundling is a great option for us to bring two-plus products to our customers and it helps obviously not just the average order size but it helps with the retention, because customers that engage with more than one product tend to retain at higher rate. And that's an area of focus for us and we're pretty excited about where we're going. On the OmniCommerce issue, we've had great success selling into our base but it's still very, very early days. Very similar to your question about payable domain. I'm super excited about payable domains. We have some early results that I indicated and there's more to do. But all of these things we're very early in the process. We're very excited about the opportunity in the future. And overall the attach of these products to our existing customers continues to be good. I think in terms of sharing specific numbers on that, we'd want to have it reach certain milestones so we can share more with you. \nMark McCaffrey: And on the Worldpay, we had talked about that last quarter. We're really excited about the Worldpay agreement in the -- they're selling our product in the market. We have a -- I would say a hard launch in the second half of the year. Minimal impact this year we're planning on. But going into next year, it should have some great momentum.\nMark Zgutowicz: Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nMark McCaffrey: Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So I want to ask about AI. Apologies, if it has been asked. But I know you mentioned some of the generative AI, prompt library and some things you're doing on that front. But certainly recently but really over the past couple of months there's been a greater dialogue about generative AI disrupting the web builder business. And I want to get your thoughts on that, how you're approaching it and how you think about AI maybe not just in the near-term but over the long-term as well?\nAman Bhutani: Well, Ygal thanks for that question. And no it hasn't been asked yet. So let me just take a moment and just take a step back to talk about the long-term and then give you a couple of examples of how we're thinking about it in the immediate term. Obviously like many other folks we want a future where AI is a positive contributor to humanity and society as a whole. And we're absolutely aligned with that view of the world. Where we see opportunities and some of them are a little ways away, some of them are sooner, is that AI creates moments of delight and surprise for customers. It allows us to create a new set of tools that allow customers to get more value faster easier, so they can focus on the things that they need to do growing their business and they have to worry less about the mechanics of things that technology can take care of. And that is the history of tools. Tools make -- allow people to do things that they otherwise would have had a hard time doing. And AI for us and in our business, in our industry I think is going to provide another set of new tools for our customers. In terms of how our customers think about this I happen to sit on, like, yesterday for two hours in the seat next to one of our customers that customer actually uses our entire solution from GoDaddy Studio to the website to the hardware device in their store and we had a great conversation for two hours. And I asked him about AI and what he feels as a micro business owner. And his point was very, very simple, which actually aligns with our company's view of it. He said, of course I want AI to help me message a customer or prompt me and tell me what the customer is asking about so I can help my customer. But my business relies on the personal relationship I have. And this him I'm talking, I have with our customer. And I don't want a machine talking to our customers. The difference happens in our business because of the owner himself his wife, who's the creative person behind that business. They are the ones that make the difference. So they want to hold that interaction. And for them AI is a tool. And frankly, if GoDaddy can make it easier by using AI tools to make it easier for them to engage with their customers, they're all for that. But at the end of the day it is about tools and not about replacing what they actually do for them. If you translate that into our business, we -- well, one a large part of our business domains hosting and other is sort of not related to AI in the same way. But when it comes to content creation, when it comes to websites, what we see for the foreseeable future is great opportunities to create new set of capabilities for customers that allow micro businesses to compete with larger businesses in a manner that has not been seen before. And that's what we're focused on and we're very excited about achieving that.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. That's really helpful. I think some of the ways -- it's been depicted about how AI disrupts your business model. So, a little bit too simplistic. So it's good to hear that from you. I think you also mentioned taking share within the website builder space. And you guys give your overall customer count but not the specific customer count on Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. So I wanted to maybe see if you can elaborate on that point a little bit more and get a little bit more color. Thanks.\nAman Bhutani: Sure. As you know, Websites + Marketing allows, customers the best way the simplest way to build a high-performing website. And given the domains funnel that we have a lot of customers that we see are sort of folks with new ideas. It's their dream they want to take it to market and Website + Marketing provides them just a great, great way to start there. We do look at share numbers internally and we -- as you know, there's no sort of public way to look at website share, but we do spend time and energy understanding the counter websites and what our share in it and it is across all our presence products. And that's what we try to share with you to say, look, we see us taking share. And out of the product -- presence products we have actually Websites + Marketing continues to be doing the best. And we continue to keep it very focused on the customer serves well. We are not distracted about that product serving everybody. It has a target customer segment. It's doing a fantastic job. And of course, there's more to be done and we can talk about that separately. But I'm very happy that Websites + Marketing is continuing to take share.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. Great. Just to be clear, your -- when you're talking about taking share, are you including WordPress on that or not?\nAman Bhutani: We have overall taken share as well in the website space, but I didn't break it down by each of the Presence products we have. But amongst -- across the products the product that took the most share was Websites + Marketing.\nYgal Arounian: Great. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ella Smith from Morningstar. Ella, please go ahead.\nElla Smith: Hi. This is Ella from JPMorgan. First question is, I was wondering if you could speak more about your partnerships -- recently announced partnerships, specifically with Apple and Microsoft teams. Especially, I would appreciate if you could talk more about the Tap to Pay partnership, because that seems like a pretty unique opportunity. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Super excited about the Tap to Pay opportunity. And obviously, I think all of you know well what the functionality offers. I think what GoDaddy has to bring that's a bit special is that we work with Apple directly to create a truly seamless experience. I would love to in a different setting showcase that for our analysts and customers on a bus tour or something. So you can actually, see how much easier it is when GoDaddy creates that what we call the seamless and intuitive experience. And our goal there really is to have a set of services or experiences for our customers that are also easy to use that the customer doesn't hesitate to use it. As you know, our customer is the micro business owner. And there is a cost for them to take on something new, right? Because they need to put energy into growing their business and not trying to learn new technology. So when we lower the friction bar when we make it easy for them the adoption is much faster. And that's the early signal with Tap to Pay as well that GoDaddy merchants are just very, very quickly adopting Tap to Pay. And there's actually much more we're going to give them with Tap to Pay. With Microsoft Teams, the idea there is that, we want to be able to serve our customers to any of the sort of services that they used to engage their customers. This is a new opportunity. It's something that we're exploring and are curious about, where as you well know Microsoft Teams has grown and sort of has very large user base. And what we're really offering is the payments capability within Teams. And it extends our existing sort of beautiful relationship with Microsoft through the productivity products already.\nElla Smith: Great. That's super helpful. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up I know on the last question we spoke at length about the impacts of AI to the web tool side of the business. And you did say that you don't see much impact to the core platform side of the business but I just want to confirm that. Do you think that there's even on the back end any opportunity for AI destruction to domains and hosting, or is that just not as relevant at this juncture?\nAman Bhutani: Actually, over the last couple of years, I've talked about it a little bit, but let me update some of my comments. At GoDaddy, we've been using AI to provide customers with better domain names and we've put more energy into that over the last two or three years. It was actually one of the things we had mentioned where when we had first seen the acceleration of the aftermarket that we were actually using machine learning models to find better names for customers that were available where they were available in the primary market or the secondary market., So there is an impact of AI into our core business. But that impact so far has been a positive one and one that creates tools that allows customers to find better things. And at least so far we have not found any reason for those technologies to be negative on a negative impact to us. \nElla Smith: Perfect. Thank you, so much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: This concludes our Q&A. I'll turn it back to Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Christie. Just a quick shout out to all GoDaddy employees for another solid quarter. We are super excited about the execution of the company. We're clear in our strategy and it takes all of us to get it there. And we appreciate you taking the time today to join this call and ask us a few questions. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Thank you, Christie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. GoDaddy's mission is to empower entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. We learn from our customers every day and they are a resilient group and they value what GoDaddy brings to them. While many worry about a recession, our venture forward service found that our customers are noticeably more optimistic today about the future of their business than they were six months ago. One customer we showcased in the past is the Furlough Cheesecake founded by two sisters impacted by a government furlough. In a recent interview, one of them commented, with partners like GoDaddy we can manage our business from anywhere. GoDaddy helped us launch our business quickly from idea to up and running in one week because they had the tools in place. GoDaddy's unique combination of seamless intuitive technology and best-in-class human and digital guidance creates the ease of use that our customers want and need so they can focus on their business. This combination continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, helping us drive profitable growth and superb cash flow. We serve 21 million customers that have a high retention rate of 85%. In Q1, we drove double-digit growth of 12% in our Applications and Commerce segment supported by 10% ARR growth in our Create and Grow products. Additionally, we surpassed $1 billion in annualized GPV for GoDaddy payments. One area we continue to watch carefully is our aftermarket business. We faced tough compares last quarter and a continued unevenness in flow of large deals that we believe is impacted by broader macro headwinds. Overall, we are pleased with our Q1 results and encouraged by the positive momentum over the quarter, especially in our Subscription and Commerce businesses. Our strategic priorities remain consistent and our teams continue to launch experiments and new experiences at a fast pace. As always, I will review each of our priorities. For our first priority, driving Commerce through presence, we are happy to share that we gained exciting traction in our Commerce offerings. We had our best quarter yet, attracting sellers, more than we anticipated and rapidly crossed over the $1 billion of annualized GPV. The largest opportunity for us remains our existing base, of 21 million customers and the many sellers that are already a part of it. The efficient motion of selling into our existing customer base, was the primary contributor to our GPV growth. And hence, it remains our focus as we work to scale this sales team. Adopting our commerce product, paves the way for customers to deepen the relationship with us, which results in higher retention and increased lifetime value. Last month, we also launched Apple's contactless Tap to Pay technology, within our GoDaddy app. As you know, Tap to Pay allows our customers to accept all types of contactless in-person payments, with only an iPhone just by tapping their credit card, mobile wallet or watch. We worked directly with Apple, to integrate this technology natively, creating a seamless, best-in-class, low-friction sign of experience for our app customers. We also made several other improvements to make websites plus marketing a more robust solution, for sellers including improved pay buttons, and new reports for merchants to help them prepare their taxes and understand their fees and payouts. Our teams are also excited about, how generative AI can add ease of use for customers, by auto populating content for them and helping them create natural language, e-mails, chat and text messages, they engage with their customers. AI-powered tools are showing up across multiple experiences at GoDaddy. For example, we built instant video features in our Studios app and use cases like auto generating product descriptions, are coming soon. As always, we are focused on both technology tools and guidance for our customers. As our customers start exploring generative AI, we want to help them by launching a growing area of resources so our small business owners can begin harnessing, its power to save time and grow their sales. For example, we now provide an essential small business guide [indiscernible] library. We are also working to bring these capabilities together, in a manner that even the smallest businesses can benefit from instantaneously accessing vast amounts of data and transforming it into something meaningful for their business. Websites + Marketing continues to be rated, as the highest-performing website builder according to Google Core, Web vitals and it is taking share in the marketplace. The team continues to focus on making it easy for customers, to build high-performance websites quickly. On our second priority, delivering for GoDaddy Pro. Our goal is to make them better serve their clients and grow their businesses. GoDaddy Pro's value, platform capabilities like performance, availability and security, but also automation, support, ease of use and value-added offers. Our new managed WooCommerce store offering replaced our old managed WordPress Commerce offering, over the last few weeks. With this new product in place, we are bringing many more capabilities to the table and we'll be able to test into higher-priced SKUs. On our Hosting business, our focus is around stabilization and simplification. As discussed previously, we are on course to integrate brands more deeply which includes retiring the Media Temple brand with the final migration of customers to the GoDaddy full stack. In April, we also signed an agreement to exit a couple of our smaller European brands. Our goal remains to provide customers with a higher level of service at a lower cost to serve while sharpening our focus. On our third priority innovation in domains. We have continued to broaden our bundling offers for new and existing customers, while our initial focus was around bundling e-mail, we have increased experimentation velocity and are doing much more here. We are improving the onboarding flow for customers with the target of higher attach and encouraged by the results we have seen. This matters because we know that customers who activate and attach more products have higher retention rates. And we continue to be excited about payable domains and have two clear insights since our launch: first customers who adopt this product are demonstrating their satisfaction by quickly doing a significant number of transactions through the default tailing we provide. Our initial efforts to drive more traffic to this product resulted in impressive early GPV. Second, we noticed that existing customers are more ready to use this product compared to potential customers who are new to purchasing a domain. We are currently focused on creating more opportunities for both existing and new domain customers to discover and utilize payable domains. Although there is still work to be done, we strongly believe in the enormous potential of this offering. On the aftermarket, you will remember our List for Sale feature that allows GoDaddy customers to list their domain in the aftermarket. This quarter we extended this capability to our registrar partners, opening a channel to bring more inventory to the aftermarket. We've also added new features to the customer experience for brokered aftermarket transactions. We built a new lead center giving real-time status updates to the leads being pursued on behalf of domain sellers so they can have more visibility into progress on their transactions. Our aftermarket business continues to innovate and create value for our customers and all players in the industry. At GoDaddy, we are eager to help small businesses thrive. This fuels us to create better products that deliver greater value for our customers which drives our attractive financial model that then translates into sustained customer and shareholder value. This is the simple approach of how we work to grow GoDaddy and differentiate our offerings. We are proud of the consistency of our strong execution and our strategy. We have a great business with a loyal and growing customer base that continues to spend more time. With us through our strong competitive advantages and attractive financial profile GoDaddy is well positioned to continue to grow and deliver for all stakeholders in meaningful ways. With that here's Mark. Yes. And maybe I'll just add Mark, Matt that we see of course the headwinds away but we also have good momentum in the business. Mark already mentioned the growth in AMC, but also the domains business has done well and demand has been better and improving. So we're very sort of encouraged by the momentum and that's what we're really talking about. John? Yes, John thanks for that question. Mark has talked about the pillars of revenue for Commerce. And we actually saw goodness across all of them. But selling into our existing base of customers was the largest driver of this acceleration and growth and we continue to be very excited about it. In terms of how that sales cycle works, our customers have a fantastic relationship with GoDaddy. And we're bringing not just sort of the surprise and delight element of hey you have this relationship with GoDaddy and we have more to offer, we also have great pricing for them. So, when you put together the relationship all the basket of sort of one-stop shop and the pricing that leads to them switching over from other folks. And we -- this is -- of course, we're excited about payable domains and that did its part and resellers did its part. And everyone -- every piece helped, but the prime focus for us is selling into our base. We're seeing goodness there. We're going to keep attacking that. And from what we can see it seems to be a bit of a unique competitive advantage for GoDaddy because of the relationships we have. So, we absolutely are continuing on path on that. Yes. GMV as a whole if you remember is the broader sort of set of customers we have also inherited from Poynt and it tends to follow seasonality of the business Q4 versus Q1 and nothing new to sort of report that. Thanks John. Yes. And maybe just very quickly Clarke if I can add. If you look at items like marketing spend, obviously, I've talked about it a lot over the last couple of years, but we continue to sort of make our ability to measure return on ad spend better and better globally. And what we're seeing is good gross ads good demand coming to the site and the lowest marketing spend sort of as a percentage of revenue that we've had in a while. So obviously, that continues to help us as well apart from sort of the actions that Mark talked about which are more on the people side. And we can \u2013 those two thoughts together with bookings growing faster than revenue both those pieces basically come together. I think from two views, one from our customer's view I think the challenges in the financial banking crisis have not had a significant impact for our customers. I would remind you that many of our customers are micro businesses and they don't even access to banking services or capital and they really are a very creative group. And for our business as a whole obviously, we're not dependent on SVB or sort of risks that come close to the regional banking places. I don't know Mark if \u2013 what you would add? Maybe, I'll just talk about attach more broadly real quick and then get into OmniCommerce as well. We talked about bundling a little bit. And as Mark said bundling is a great option for us to bring two-plus products to our customers and it helps obviously not just the average order size but it helps with the retention, because customers that engage with more than one product tend to retain at higher rate. And that's an area of focus for us and we're pretty excited about where we're going. On the OmniCommerce issue, we've had great success selling into our base but it's still very, very early days. Very similar to your question about payable domain. I'm super excited about payable domains. We have some early results that I indicated and there's more to do. But all of these things we're very early in the process. We're very excited about the opportunity in the future. And overall the attach of these products to our existing customers continues to be good. I think in terms of sharing specific numbers on that, we'd want to have it reach certain milestones so we can share more with you. Thanks. Well, Ygal thanks for that question. And no it hasn't been asked yet. So let me just take a moment and just take a step back to talk about the long-term and then give you a couple of examples of how we're thinking about it in the immediate term. Obviously like many other folks we want a future where AI is a positive contributor to humanity and society as a whole. And we're absolutely aligned with that view of the world. Where we see opportunities and some of them are a little ways away, some of them are sooner, is that AI creates moments of delight and surprise for customers. It allows us to create a new set of tools that allow customers to get more value faster easier, so they can focus on the things that they need to do growing their business and they have to worry less about the mechanics of things that technology can take care of. And that is the history of tools. Tools make -- allow people to do things that they otherwise would have had a hard time doing.

            "content": "Thanks, Aman. Before getting into the detailed results, I wanted to summarize a few key points. First, we are making progress towards returning to double-digit growth while executing our three year plan to expand our operating margins and deliver on our free cash flow per share targets; second, we are delivering on our applications and Commerce segment growth through increases in new customers and the conversion of our existing customers to our payments platform in the US.; lastly, we are on target to complete our restructuring action in the second quarter, driving better operating leverage in our core platform segment and improving our overall operating margin in the second half of the year. With that, Applications & Commerce revenue grew to $338 million up 12%, exceeding our guide of 8% to 10%. Additionally, the normalized EBITDA margin for Applications & Commerce was 39%. Taken together, this highlights the impressive performance we are driving in this business which delivered ARR for Create and Grow of $450 million, up 10% and over $1 billion of GPV. This segment is our largest opportunity to drive growth through the attachment of our Create and Grow products, Commerce platform and productivity solutions for both new and existing customers. ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 9% to more than $1.3 billion. Annualized GMV, across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 18% to approximately $28 billion. Our core platform segment which includes Domains, Hosting and Security continues to serve as an important on-ramp to our overall business. Core Platform revenue was $698 million with an ARR of $2.2 billion and a strong normalized EBITDA margin of 27%. Core Platform revenue was supported by a 5% growth in domains from a combination of new customer adds, attach and price increases on renewals. This was offset by tough compares for our aftermarket business as well as the continued uneven flow of large transactions. Additionally, there are modest impacts to our hosting revenue and customer count from migration of non-core hosting platforms being sunset. Total revenue, grew to $1.04 billion up 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a sequential lift from the Q4 growth rate. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Q1 bookings grew faster than revenue at a rate of 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, totaling $1.2 billion. Bookings growth on our subscription products outpaced the related revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points. Our durable model continues to generate cash flow through our strong customer relationships and cohort performance, highlighted by our customer retention rate of 85%. We build on this strength through intentionally focusing our marketing on attracting high-intent customers that stay with GoDaddy and spend more. This quarter, we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers, despite headwinds from our migration efforts noted above. Our ARPU grew 4% to $197 from $190 last year. Normalized EBITDA grew 11% to $250 million with a margin of 24%, representing approximately 160 basis points expansion. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage through strong execution and our restructuring efforts. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $304 million, growing 6% driven by strong profitability, while free cash flow remained flat at $259 million, despite an increase in our cash interest expense due to the refinancing of our term debt in Q4 2022. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.19 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.25, an 18% increase driven by execution, operating leverage and share repurchases. Additionally, in Q1 we completed $114 million of share buybacks, repurchasing 1.6 million shares. This brings the cumulative share repurchase under our $3 billion authorization to $1.4 billion and 18.4 million shares reducing shares outstanding since inception by 11%. We remain on target for our commitment to reduce our fully diluted shares outstanding by 15% to 20% over the three-year period. On the balance sheet we finished Q1 with $892 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.9 billion. Net debt stands at $3 billion with 2.7 times net leverage within our targeted range of two to four times. Lastly as noted above we signed an agreement to divest certain non-core hosting assets which is expected to close by Q3. Our restructuring charge of $50 million in the quarter included $21 million of a non-cash impairment charge for these assets. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q2 total revenue in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.065 billion, representing growth of 4% at the midpoint. With the current momentum, we expect to exit the year at approximately 7% top line growth with a normalized EBITDA of 28%. We expect applications and Commerce segment growth to be between 8% and 10% for both Q2 and the full year. For core platform, we expect revenue growth 1% to 3% in Q2 and accelerate in the back half of the year to deliver between 2% and 4% for the full year. Q2 normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve to approximately 25% with continued acceleration over the back half of the year to deliver full year normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 26%, showing improved operating leverage from the actions previously discussed. I would like to spend a moment bridging our expected 2023 revenue growth to what we believe our strategy and model can produce going forward. Our current guide for the full year is 5% revenue growth at the midpoint. As a reminder, this year's revenue growth rate includes approximately two points of FX pressure from last year's bookings and is also impacted by difficult compares in our aftermarket business and the divestiture of certain non-core revenue-generating assets. Looking ahead to next year and beyond, absent those negative impacts and with the momentum we are driving through the strategic initiatives Aman spoke about earlier including ARPU expansion, even with the continuation of the current macro environment there is a path to returning to double-digit top line growth, while remaining committed to delivering our margin expansion and free cash flow targets. We remain disciplined in how and where we spend with a focus on controlling our costs, optimize our marketing spend, monitoring headcount and investing in innovation so that we can strike the right balance between capturing attractive opportunities with delivering value to our shareholders always with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. In closing, we have strong confidence in our ability to execute and accelerate our growth. We believe our competitive position and strategic advantages, our diverse product offerings, our strong balance sheet and the consistent and predictable cash flow we generate will position GoDaddy as a leader amongst its peers. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We remain focused on execution against our strategic priorities responsibly managing our business and building deeper customer relationships as we partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. With that we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. Thanks Matt. I'll handle the first part of that and it sounds like you have a second question too. So on the bridge we do see I would say easier comps on things like aftermarket coming into the second half of the year which will start to serve as a tailwind. So normalizing the core platform segment growth obviously is in the cards as it turns around into easy year compares in that end of it. Domains is growing at a good pace. And obviously we're taking some actions on hosting which will act as a headwind in the back half of the year but turn into a tailwind as well next year. So a lot of positive momentum. Obviously applications and commerce continues to be the higher growing segment for us. We're seeing a lot of traction on commerce. And we've talked about the four pillars there and then being in the market and we're really happy with the performance of those. So the ability to bridge to what we see as a path to that double-digit growth we've talked about we think starts to take that momentum in 2024. Yes. No doubt Matt that we've talked about that product mix will impact our gross margin. And we're focusing on operating margin as we run the business and expansion of that. But as we get into more of the transactional businesses we can continue to see pressure on the gross margin, but be in that 60 -- low 60s to mid-60s range. As it scales it becomes more accretive. Obviously we get the leverage on the operating margin and it'll help us deliver on our normalized EBITDA. Thanks, Matt. Yes. Thanks, Trevor. On core platform, aftermarket and the larger transactions continues to be the area that is uneven for us and becoming difficult to predict. We saw some strength as we were exiting the quarter, but it continues to be uneven and that pretty much drove our underperformance. So a moderate impact from some of the actions we were taking on integrating the non-core hosting platforms, but I would say aftermarket was probably the area of putting us below the original range. On application and commerce, the AGV is ahead of what we -- at a great rate. We're seeing a lot of conversion of our existing customer base which is driving the GPV including new customers signing on. So we're really pleased with the momentum there. Really pleased with the attach we're getting around the websites related to our commerce SKUs. So all that has got great momentum in the quarter. We also saw the benefit of the stickiness of -- as our customers and the applications with commerce are adding more than one product, the retention rates are improving. We've always seen that trend and now we're seeing it more in Q1 with commerce. And with that, we're issuing less refunds and that helped us in the quarter as well that we didn't have to. We're seeing that stickiness start to take place. So we're seeing between the two segments, I would say, as we're integrating the core hosting assets, we are seeing some headwinds around retention of, what I would say, customers with more in the area of one product, but we are seeing a pickup in A&C of the customers with multiple products and multiple services, which is helping us. On capital allocation -- sorry, I almost forgot there was two parts to that. Nothing to call out. We are ahead of schedule at the end of the year. We came into the year with the $1 billion target that hasn't changed. There hasn't been any changes to our capital allocation strategy. And I would still put in there a target of $1 billion for the year. Thanks, Trevor. Yes. Thanks Clarke. So, yes 28%. And we talked about the actions we're taking in the first half that will help benefit as we get through the second half of the year and obviously exit the year at a strong run rate there of 7% and 28% of normalized EBITDA margins. A good way to look at it is as we're going through the core platform actions that we've taken around the restructuring and the integration of those platforms into the GoDaddy technology stack. There is going to be some pressure on our retention rates. And we're seeing customers that don't have a higher propensity to spend with us are making that decision as we're doing the transfer over to the GoDaddy stack. On the flip side, the -- being on the GoDaddy stack and having applications and commerce -- and Commerce and our ability for our care guys to engage our customers at a better level is really showing that we're getting more customers signing on to more than one product right now, which again pushes our retention rates higher, pushes our ARPU higher. We're seeing a lot of benefit of that. And A&C comes at a higher margin. So, we're in essence gaining more customers at the higher margin level while we're seeing pressure on the core platform. Those are the lower margin or lower calorie customers I would say. And therefore we're seeing the benefit of the mix start to improve and help us get momentum into the future years into 2024. So, hopefully, that helps kind of how we're looking at it. Yeah. You just called it. I think the primary driver was aftermarket and the continued absence of the large transactions. Just as a reminder, we don't set the prices in the aftermarket. That's a buyer and seller agreement and we kind of facilitate the transaction between two. So we're still seeing that disconnect in the market related to the buyer and seller agreeing which shows up in the larger transactions. So it's primarily the cause of the core platform missing the guide. There is a little bit on the hosting no doubt. I don't want to say it's 100% because there is some as we are migrating some of the noncore assets into the GoDaddy technology stack we have seen some pressure there. But I would say aftermarket was primary. Yeah. And I'll start with we don't guide towards ARPU, but looking at the outlook for the year when we think about our goal to attract customers with a higher intent to spend with us our goal is to raise that ARPU number. What we're seeing around the commerce is obviously giving us that momentum that we believe we'll be able to continue to drive that. Q4 to Q1 is a normal pattern for us. I know we haven't gone into quarterly disclosures of ARPU in a while, but based on our billing cycles and bookings happening earlier in the process and in the year that revenue from the bookings will flow through to our ARPU as it rolls out in our subscription business. So it will be a natural benefit that we will start to see. So we're excited about attracting more customers with higher intent. We're seeing that especially in the commerce area, which showed up in Q1. The momentum there has been really, really good and we continue to be driving towards adding that ARPU as we go throughout the year. Yes, it's a good inquiry. When you think about our ARPU at $197 and the cost of that to our customers and the value that we provide to them in new business, not a real impact there. Even when you talk about the FDIC limits and all that and the micro businesses and entrepreneurs, we think our customers are optimistic and we're seeing them eager to sell in the marketplace but we're not seeing any limitations based on the banking prices. Okay. So I'm going to hand \u2013 there was a few things in there Mark. So I'm going to try to go through them sequentially. If I miss anything, please point it out. A&C revenue guide, we are really excited about the 12% in Q1, showing great momentum coming into the year. We talked about it. This is the first quarter in which we had all four pillars in market. And that we've been engaging our customers converting our existing customer base in the US and just unbelievable traction. And we're also seeing play out is that the stickiness of going from the one to the two to the three products is playing out and improving \u2013 I want to say improving our refunds but lowering our refunds to our customers. So we saw a benefit of that in Q1. We are early stage though. So we \u2013 it's one quarter in and we like the momentum. We'll see how it rolls out throughout the year but we feel excited about the ability to continue that momentum throughout the year and into 2024. I think on the attach of the OmniCommerce, Aman, do you want to talk about it? And on the Worldpay, we had talked about that last quarter. We're really excited about the Worldpay agreement in the -- they're selling our product in the market. We have a -- I would say a hard launch in the second half of the year. Minimal impact this year we're planning on. But going into next year, it should have some great momentum. Thank you."

With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy is relentlessly focused on creating customer value and transforming it to shareholder value through better conversion, attach and retention. This is the driving force behind our profitable growth model, propelling us towards our north star of maximizing free cash flow over the long-term. Our strong Q3 results demonstrate our effective execution of this strategy, delivering both innovation and operational efficiency. We drove meaningful growth in free cash flow increasing 29% year-over-year, and application and commerce bookings were up 20% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded by over 400 basis points. We are excited to share updates on our growth and margin initiatives driving success in 2024. Pricing in bundling, seamless experience, commerce and cost optimization are all ahead of schedule, driving the strong results mentioned. The enthusiasm for GoDaddy Airo continues to vibrate within our teams. And along with an update today, we are looking forward to more live demos at our investor dinner in early December. Pricing and bundling continues to deliver solid results with productivity-focused efforts remaining a key contributor to the 20% application and commerce bookings growth this quarter. As we have said before, we view the pricing and bundling initiative as a multiyear journey that leverages our software platforms, vast data and machine learning capabilities allowing us to bundle solutions in a way that offers greater value to customers with pricing aligned to the value delivered. While our efforts this year have been concentrated on productivity solutions, we will expand the initiative across more of our product suite, extending this initiative beyond the application and commerce segment. Putting a finer point on this, this means the financial impact of pricing and bundling can favorably drive growth in both A&C and Core platform segments starting in Q4. Our seamless experience initiative exceeded expectations as we continue to remove friction in the customer experience and improve purchase, onboarding and renewal path. Given our scale, even modest improvements in conversion and renewal can yield meaningful results. In Managed WordPress, we added security enhancements to all new domains attached to the platform as well as expanded AI-powered features, making it easier for customers to build and manage their websites. Additionally, with the recent launch of the GoDaddy Digital Marketing Suite, we are giving customers an intuitive all in one product to help grow and market their businesses regardless of where their website is hosted. Features like these empower our customers to better acquire, engage and expand their own customer base. For our commerce initiative, we continue to enhance our offering by introducing new AI-powered features that simplify operations for merchants. The two new SaaS plans we launched last quarter, Point-Of-Sale Plus and Invoicing Plus have had positive adoption trends since being fully rolled out. We have set aggressive attached targets, and the team is making progress against them. Finally, within our cost optimization initiative, we augmented care interactions in 20 international markets with our new generative AI-powered conversational bot providing our customers with better instant self-service access to solutions for common issues. We found that use of this technology led to double-digit improvement in containment rates, representing a savings of over 16 million incremental contact minutes without sacrificing customer satisfaction. We are excited with the progress on the conversational bot and along with GABI, we expect these to continue to drive leverage in care while delivering a better experience globally. And Airo is starting to provide a magical experience to customers that we aspire to provide across every interaction. It is a compelling proof point to our multiple year journey to successfully leverage our software platform and unleash the combined power of our infrastructure, large-scale data, experimentation, AI and machine learning capabilities. With the capabilities of Airo, we evolved the domain to represent so much more. It is now a gateway to a true business-in-a-box experience, allowing our customers to go from idea to online in minutes. Our teams are moving at a fast pace even before celebrating the one-year anniversary of the initial customer testing for Airo, it was available in over 180 countries globally. Nearly 3 million customers have discovered Airo with over half of them engaging with the experience. We are pleased with the momentum in discovery and engagement and just as exciting are the proof points we are driving in Airo monetization. With many months of data, we can clearly see that the largest engagement winner is website building. Over half of engaged users published a coming soon page, which is a customizable one page website. Customers engaged with Airo are quickly becoming the largest funnel for websites plus marketing with over 40% of websites plus marketing paid subscriptions in Q3 originating with the Airo experience. Our goals with Airo are about discovery, engagement and monetization. And with these large discovery and engagement numbers and multiple paths to monetization, Airo is off to a great start. And there is so much more we can do given the positive traction we are eager to expand the Airo experience across all on-ramps at GoDaddy, and we plan to increase investment in marketing initiatives to support this broader launch. So far, the customer exposed to Airo starts with a domain purchase. And in the next few weeks, we will start rolling out Airo to customers that start with a website purchase. Just as websites have become the highest attached product for domains on Airo, we expect to drive attach with other products when every website customer starts with an Airo experience. This underscores our commitment to rapidly scaling products enabled by Airo as it continues to transform the customer experience and drive new avenues of growth. We look forward to showing you more during our upcoming investor dinner event on December 3. We plan to showcase paid tiers for Airo with premium offerings like advanced logos and imagery as well as AI-powered marketing tools to help our customers grow their businesses. Equally exciting, we will highlight our conversational experience to building and maintaining word press sites, which reimagines harnessing the power of WordPress through a simplified intuitive interface. We will also demo our site optimizer tool, which can inspect any website and provide actionable recommendations to improve performance with just a click. While these products themselves will be brand new, they represent our continued focus on leveraging AI and machine learning and our unique scale and data to deliver magical seamless experiences for our customers. We are thrilled to give you a first look at these innovations that will drive our growth and success in the future. In closing, we remain steadfastly focused on executing our key growth initiatives. I am delighted with the speed of execution and our relentless commitment to help our customers thrive. The GoDaddy team remains dedicated to propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. We delivered strong Q3 results, demonstrating our disciplined execution of the strategy we shared at our recent Investor Day. Our focus on building increasing customer lifetime value through developing and delivering seamless technology that drives conversion, attach and retention is demonstrated in our financial results. In the third quarter, we drove sustained double-digit A&C revenue growth, increasing 16% as well as impressive normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 32%. We made progress toward our North Star, growing free cash flow 29% to $363 million. In addition, we continued to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which focused on share buybacks, reducing our fully diluted shares outstanding to $144 million. Total revenue grew to $1.15 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis. For our high-margin A&C segment, we drove 20% growth in bookings and 16% growth in revenue to $423 million, in line with our guided range on the strong performance of the growth initiatives Aman spoke about earlier. The segment EBITDA margin for A&C improved to 46% on the strength of our high gross margin proprietary solutions partially offset by the strong performance and lower gross margin profiles of our commerce offerings and third-party solutions. A&C segment EBITDA was also boosted by significant leverage gains across all operating expenses. Our proactive effort to simplify our infrastructure and recruit global talent were the main driving factors behind this strength. In addition, ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 15% to $1.6 billion. We delivered $725 million of revenue for our Core Platform segment representing growth in revenue and bookings of 3%, in line with our guided range. Performance this quarter reflected the strength in primary domains partially offset by hosting divestitures and end-of-life migrations. Segment EBITDA margin for the Core Platform grew to 33% and ARR for our Core Platform segment grew 4% to $2.4 billion. ARPU grew 8% to $215 on a trailing 12-months basis, while our customer count declined slightly to $20.7 million. With the previously mentioned divestiture and migration efforts behind us, we expect to return to customer growth in 2025. Currently, our consolidated customer retention rate remains at 85% and over 50% of our customers have two or more paid products with us. Moving to profitability. We drove expansion in normalized EBITDA in the third quarter, growing 24% and to $367 million and delivering an expanded margin of 32%, up over 400 basis points. This was driven by the gross margin tailwind noted above, coupled with operational discipline that drove leverage in our P&L. The front-loaded benefits of our 2023 restructuring, infrastructure simplification and global talent recruitment are evident, and we are pleased with these accomplishments. As we look forward, we remain on track to deliver our Investor Day targets of approximately 33% by 2026. Additionally, as we look to the upcoming quarters, we expect to increase investment in marketing to support our broader launch of our Airo enabled solutions to showcase our top-rated AI website builder and capture customer demand. On bookings, we delivered $1.2 billion in the third quarter representing 9% growth on both a reported and a constant currency basis. As a reminder, bookings primarily represents the cash collected during the period. Subscription bookings grew 2 points ahead of subscription revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 25% to $399 million, and free cash flow grew 29% to $363 million. Capital expenditures were down approximately 46% because of data center divestitures. Through October 28, we repurchased 5.2 million shares year-to-date, totaling $668 million. We repurchased 39.4 million shares for $3.2 billion under our current authorizations, and we have $767 million remaining. We drove a 23% reduction in gross shares outstanding since January 2022, 3 points ahead of our three-year targeted reduction of 20%. At the quarter end, 144 million fully diluted shares remain outstanding. On our balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $767 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt was $3.1 billion, representing a net leverage of 2x on a trailing 12-month basis. Pivoting to our outlook. We are raising the full-year revenue guide to $4.545 billion to $4.565 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint of our range. For the fourth quarter, we are targeting revenue between $1.165 billion and $1.185 billion, also representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. In Applications & Commerce, we expect mid-teens revenue growth for Q4 and the full-year. In Core Platform, we expect low single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full-year. As our track record demonstrates, we are committed to maintaining our operational discipline driving further operational leverage in our model and expanding margins. Including the additional marketing investment we expect to make in the fourth quarter, we remain on course to deliver a 31% normalized EBITDA margin. Given our year-to-date performance, we are also raising our full-year normalized EBITDA expectation to 30%, keeping in mind our nearly 1:1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio, we are also raising our unlevered free cash flow target to $1.475 billion plus and free cash flow to $1.325 billion plus for the full-year. Our disciplined capital allocation approach remains unchanged, and we will evaluate all opportunities for shareholder return according to our rigorous and returns-based framework. We are committed to the path we outlined at our Investor Day, executing our strategy to deliver both durable top line growth and expanded profitability as we drive toward our North Star. Our robust cash generation, strong balance sheet and capital allocation framework underpin our investment thesis and power our ability to create enduring value for our shareholders. We are pleased with our progress towards our Investor Day target of $4.5 billion plus in cumulative free cash flow generation supported by 6% to 8% annual revenue growth and expansion of our normalized EBITDA margin to 33% by 2026. Lastly, we look forward to welcoming you to our annual investor dinner on December 3 in our new Tempe, Arizona headquarters. I will now turn the call over to our Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Christie Masoner, to open the call for your questions.\nA - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. [Technical Difficulty] Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks. Can you hear me?\nAman Bhutani: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, great. Thanks. Hey, I wanted to ask two questions about the Applications & Commerce segment. The first one is on bookings growth. Yes, I realize you don't guide to that metric, but just wondering if you could give us any thoughts on how that could track in the fourth quarter this year and some of the puts and takes we should be considering for bookings growth as we go through the rest of the year. And then second, this is your third straight quarter now of Applications & Commerce, bookings growth of 20% or higher. And so I'm wondering if you could remind us of the relationship between that metric and forward revenue growth for that segment and some of the puts and takes that influence the conversion there. And specifically, if I go back to the Investor Day, you talked about this segment being a low to mid-teens type of revenue grower. But just given the bookings momentum that you've seen to date, should we be thinking about a higher level of growth in the near term for that segment? It would be great to get any thoughts on those topics, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Vik. And a couple of things, right? One, yes, bookings acceleration can be a tailwind for us in revenue. So that is a factual statement. Things to consider when we're really looking at the difference between the two is the timing with -- especially with our A&C, we have multiple different timing depending on the product mix within that group. For example, transactional and commerce. We have monthly terms. We have annual terms. We have multiyear terms. Do you really have to look at it on a broad spectrum of what products are being sold, what the mix is. And yes, it will help our -- be a tailwind for us on revenue in general. We're really excited about the momentum. Obviously, we'll talk a little bit more when we get to the Q4 earnings call about 2025. But we're comfortable with the 6% to 8% growth we talked about over the three years. We do think for the year, overall bookings will outpace revenue by about 2 points and that is obviously being pushed a lot by the A&C.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Vik.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great, thanks. First, just on the pricing and bundling going forward. I think you made comments that it's an opportunity near term in Core Platform. Can you expand upon that a little bit? Should we assume that, that's going to happen in some of the bigger line items such as domains? And then second question, aftermarket growth slowed quite a bit in 3Q, kind of flattish year-on-year versus double-digits earlier in the year. Was that consistent with your expectations? And was there anything kind of onetime there? I know it's very transactional in nature, so tough to predict, but just any color on what's going on in aftermarket would be helpful.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Trevor. I can take the pricing in one-line approach. As we've talked about, pricing and bundling is about finding the right cohorts of customers, where we can provide the right value to customers and then price along with that value. And the way we do this is that we experiment at different price points of find the price elasticity curve. And then what that curve helps us do is find the right cohorts where we can sort of balance attrition for customers, right, or let's say, retention of customers with the pricing opportunity in front of us. And that's a great balance. Right at the company, we want to drive as much growth as we can while maintaining our high customer retention rates. So for pricing and bundling, that approach of using machine learning, using experimentation, using the scale of our data and our competitive advantages there, we can direct that way of working across our product suite and cohorts within that product suite. So what we're really -- what I'm really talking about here is that we have identified other cohorts of customers that we will be applying this approach to. And some of those are going to have products that sit in the Core Platform, which is now going to take sort of the benefit of pricing and bundling across both the segments.\nMark McCaffrey: And Trevor on aftermarket, yes. Just a reminder, it's a volatile business. We think over time, it will be a low single-digit dollar. And we always talk about there could be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, it was down slightly. Nothing to call out in and of itself. We saw some pressure on valuations at the lower level, all of the demand seem to continue. And again, we don't control the pricing on the aftermarket. It's a buyer to seller green pricing. So again, thesis still holds. We believe it will be a low single-digit grower over time, and we'll see a little bit of variability in the quarter-to-quarter and we'll just call it out.\nTrevor Young: Great, thank you both.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Ken, please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Can you guys hear me? Okay.\nChristie Masoner: Yes.\nKen Wong: Okay, perfect. I just wanted to just touch on an earlier statement that you made in terms of resuming customer acquisition in 2025. Was that just generally meant as a sort of as you anniversary the divestitures? Or should we assume a heavier pace of investments in '25 to kind of pursue a more attractive growth opportunity?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. So the first part of it is, yes, it was just to call out that we are lapping the divestitures, the integrations and the end-of-life we've talked about previously. And as we start to lap them throughout this year, net customer adds will have -- that headwind will go away. And Aman, if you want to comment on the marketing, what we talked about.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Look, we're super excited, Ken, about the product portfolio we have in play right now, brought together by Airo, just an almost magical experience for our customers. We've got the product rolled out, we've always had sort of very good guardrails for our marketing spend. But given the product offering that we have, there's an opportunity for us to spend up in marketing, and we do expect to get more customers as a result of that. And like Mark said, there is a normalization of the divestitures and some of the actions we've taken. It also includes some actions that we took with viral offers that we have out there, and we're going to lapse on that too.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then maybe a quick follow-up on a similar question to Vikram. A&C ARR accelerated on a tougher comp. Is that something we could continue to see considering the pace of A&C bookings at that 20% level?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. So higher level, obviously, as we go into Q4 and into 2025, the strength of A&C will get harder to compare to. So on a percentage basis, we like the momentum overall that will continue. But obviously, the percentage comps get a little harder as we go on into next year.\nAman Bhutani: And just to confirm, I think you have the sort of A&C comparatives from last year for Q3 and Q4, and you can see the sort of step up in Q4 comps that happens.\nKen Wong: Perfect. Thank you guys.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian: Hey guys, good afternoon.\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Ygal.\nYgal Arounian: Great to see some of the early starting points with Airo and Aman, you called out some of these things around the engagement that we're seeing. Last quarter, you talked about -- start to put in some paywalls testing around that. I want to see how that's progressing and then maybe kind of connecting the dots with the engagement and the expectations around moving in into the starting point of the website piece versus the domain piece. And are you starting to see a real kind of financial results, presumably if -- what was it 40% of what's that spot marketing subscriptions are originating with Airo? That means yes. But maybe just help us understand that a little bit better.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Thanks, Ygal. So the progress with Airo goes on a time line of discovery, engagement and monetization. And Discovery is about getting Airo in front of as many customers as possible and getting them to just discover that GoDaddy has a breadth of products available to them. The engagement piece is about getting them to engage in some of those products. And you'll remember that we call those Airo cards, getting customers to click on them, engage with them, set something up. And we're seeing really good traction on discovery and engagement. And what we did over the last quarter or two is that we started to put up paywalls where along with that engagement, if, for example, a customer got a coming soon page and wanted -- and was able to customize it a little bit, if they wanted to do more a paywall would appear and say, you need to buy subscription or websites plus marketing. Now it is possible that, that customer would have bought it anyway, two months, three months down the line, and we would have gotten that attach. But what Airo offers is the ability for us to paywall right there, get the customer to make that decision. And that paywall is actually connected to the 40% that I talked about today. And what that is about is that Airo is becoming a bigger and bigger on-ramp for our website products. And today, we have two in Airo. We have a coming soon page is doing really well and we have websites plus marketing subscription. And as Airo becomes a bigger on-ramp, Yes, of course, we're happy to see that monetization happens, but what that opens up in the future is paywalls an opportunity to sell other products because we do see in the customer behavior that customers have a need for the other offerings that we have. It's just that today, they don't discover those offerings. They don't engage with those offerings, and they definitely don't see a monetization for it. But Airo is going to let us do that, which is follow the customers, they have those subsequent needs with the paywalls in front of them. So this website paywall story is a very good story. It's a new -- it's, of course, an only story, and it's the first big one for Airo. But we have similar work in logos. We have similar work in images. These are things we're going to demo at the investor dinner. We have some work happening with palings that come with Airo and a couple of the others as well.\nYgal Arounian: Okay. Great. And maybe one more on the bundling initiatives. Still, I think, if I'm understanding correctly, still majority focused on the productivity suite. You called out a few specific products in the past quarters. Maybe if you could update us on where you are within productivity? And could we expect to see that come out with commerce in the coming quarter or two? Thank you guys.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Our pricing and bundling, the folks working on it really have the ability to test across various customer cohorts and what they're looking for are the cohorts where we can generate the best results fastest. And the best result here means creating that customer value, and then being able to monetize that value as well. So when I look across our products, we have other products to go that are much larger in terms of the base of customers. So we think that those likely are going to offer some of the better opportunities, but we'll keep you informed just like we did with productivity. I think you remember last year, we did apply this thinking to multiple products. And then we said, what you're going to see stronger or a large chunk of the return come from productivity, because we're going to zone in on that because that's where we see the opportunity. Similarly, as we go over the next few quarters, we'll sort of guide you better on where we're seeing that return. But our testing this year as we plan for next year is going well. And one of the things that we have shared today is that we see ourselves going across customer cohorts that now will be in A&C and in Core. So you'll likely see a little bit different behavior going into next year than you did this year.\nYgal Arounian: Got it. Thank you so much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Arjun, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. I'm Willow on for Arjun Bhatia. Thanks for taking our question. So just wanted to ask on macro questions. Last year, you called out you're seeing stability in your base. Can you comment if you're seeing any changes here? And then also comment on any impact to net new as well, please?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Overall, on the macro, we track the metrics I think we've talked about before and sort of, if I look at my dashboard, generally, we see some good, but we're keeping a close eye on things, specially election in the U.S. coming off. But broadly speaking, what I would say is when we think about our customer base, and Mark always likes to talk about our high attention, and I'm sure you will jump in with that. We're absolutely proud of that. But when we look at traffic coming in the door, we continue to see good gross adds. We continue to see good traffic coming to the site. And in pockets and those pockets can be geographic, those pockets can be sort of different customer segments. In pockets where we do see some sort of weakness, that's more than made up by how we've improved conversion, how we've improved pricing, all the sort of mechanics that we're applying within our seamless experience initiative. So I feel if there are a few, those are more than overcome. But broadly speaking, we continue to get good traffic, continue to get good gross adds and continue to maintain our higher retention rate for customers at 85%.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And just to add, when you take out the divestitures, when you take out the decisions we made around virals, and we look at the strong top of the funnel, what we are seeing is customers coming in with intent and how are we seeing it? Well, our ARPU is increasing, our ARPU is being driven by higher average order sizes from our customers when they initiate with us at the beginning. We see our customers attaching overall at a faster rate than they did years ago. So when you really peel through the ins and the outs of the customers, take out the divestitures, turn off the virals, we're seeing very strong behavior with intent at the front of the funnel. Now we are always subject things like valuations in aftermarket, and we've talked about that a lot, but the overall behavior of the funnel and the attachment is strong.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. That's helpful. And one more follow-up, if I may. Can you comment on the bookings growth. So it looks like for A&C, it decelerated quarter-to-quarter. It seems like customer strength is good and pricing of that were continuing [indiscernible] take deceleration. If I can understand it better?\nMark McCaffrey: So I heard the deceleration part there, and I'll address that. And maybe if you can -- if you had another part to that, let me know it was cutting out. So on the deceleration, it's tougher comps. We went from Q2 comparison in '23 to Q3 comparison in '23. It was just the most difficult comps. The momentum in and of itself is the same.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That answers my questions. Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: All right. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\nMark McCaffrey: Hey, Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Elliott: Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to just circle back on the pricing and bundling expanding into the core platform in Q4. And when we think about the A&C segment, you guys saw a big improvement with this strategy and kind of growth there almost doubled. So how should we think about the benefit unfolding for the core segment where this bookings have been a little bit more muted in the 3% to 4% range? Is there anything we should consider about the opportunity in core being larger or smaller than what you saw with productivity?\nAman Bhutani: Yes, Elizabeth. It's a little too early to sort of putting numbers on it. But we will definitely talk more about it in the next quarter's call and from there. Generally speaking, our approach is the same. The way we're using the data, the way we're cohorting customers, the way we're testing the price elasticity curve, the way we're creating it, the way we sort of decide where to go on it. All of that methodology is similar, but it takes us really sort of getting into that customer cohort in a few weeks of executing that plan to really see what it's going to be. What we do see so far is that we are ready to start on it in Q4, but likely it will take a quarter or more for us to get that run rate going where we can talk about it with a little bit more data than we have today.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And Elizabeth, nothing to change what we've put out there as guidance for Q4. We're talking about the initial steps of it, and then we'll talk about 2025 when we get to the fourth quarter earnings call.\nElizabeth Elliott: Understood. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on the margin side. You referenced in the prepared remarks just increasing marketing initiatives to support the broader launch of Airo. Is that the main factor driving some of the margin contraction to 31% in Q4 from 32% in Q3? Is there anything else to call out? And then what are some of the puts and takes set up more broadly as we think into next year? What are some of the key levers that can offset increased marketing spend around ARL?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. And just a couple of high level comments. In Q3, we benefited from a favorable product mix. Generally, we think our gross margins are going to be around 64%, give or take a 100 basis points. We saw a favorable mix within Q3. We saw -- for example, aftermarket was down about 1%, and that's a lower margin business for us. As we see our higher margin proprietary software be a better part of the mix. Our margins will lean towards the high side. If we see transactional having strength, we'll see that towards lowers on. So again, there will be product mix in there that will determine or impact on the gross margin. We had seen some front-loaded benefits from some of the restructuring simplification efforts we had, global recruitment we talked about hit into Q3. Those were front-end loaded and we'll continue to see those. And then the rest is what we alluded to was the timing. We just had timing of expenses like marketing that we'll see start to pick up a little more in Q4, still on target for the 31% we talked about, but some of that was just the timing and the expenses and how they're hitting.\nElizabeth Elliott: Got it. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from Raymond James. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Beck: Yes. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to go back to some of the Airo comments realizing that you kind of had this discover, engage, monetize framework. So I think the discovery element of it was up maybe 3x quarter-over-quarter to $3 million. So is that, when we think about the marketing spend that Elizabeth just asked about, is that really the key metric that we should be thinking about in terms of it really ramping up in the year? And is there some type of maybe not specific goal, but could it reach a pretty sizable, could it be half of your base? Just curious on how we should be considering that.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Josh. Discovery is definitely an important metric, because without the discovery metric we can't feel confident that our customers are seeing the breadth of our products, both new and existing products. But if you had to sort of fall in on one metric and say, hey, which is the one that we really are focused on optimizing on. It's really the engagement metric that we want to keep very, very healthy, and it is very, very healthy, because as we spend in marketing, discovery will definitely go up, but we don't want engagement as a percentage of drop downs. We want customers engage with this because we have data for 25 years, and we know just from our own data and the data of other companies that the engaged customers enter the monetization phase in a much more favorable manner than non-engaged customers, right? Metrics like attached conversion, do much, much better for engaged users than they do for non-engaged users. So that's if you will, that is the quality metric. That's the thing that makes sure that our efforts are valuable and are going to create more value in the future. While I'm very happy about the multiple paths monetization for Airo, and we'll show you the paywalls and the teams are doing good stuff. And the website paywall doing well and even sort of monetization on coming soon and other being great opportunities for us. I would say, overall, in our three year plan at the Investor Day earlier this year, we purposefully put Airo outside of the three year planning, because we wanted to build a very large mode of discovery and engagement. Because that very large mode of discovery and engagement will, we believe, generate sort of recurrence for years to come.\nJosh Beck: Super helpful. And then I also wanted to follow-up on this stat around double-digit containment rate improvements, I think with these GenAI bots, which I assume is something similar to a deflection rate. I wanted to clarify that. And could that be a much larger number over time and at some point, could you see benefits with respect to the P&L? Just curious how we can think about maybe where that could head?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. containment rate is like a deflection rate. It really points to the sessions where a customer asked the question and the conversational bot was able to answer the customer's question in a satisfactory manner, and that been resolved in sort of a chat being forwarded to a human agent. So seeing that sort of double-digit percentage increase in the bot being able to resolve the customer query or issues is a great first step. And look, of course, whether it's this or our guide assist part, which we call GABI, these are relatively new technologies. They're off to a great start we see great momentum in those over the next two to three years. It's our sort of our -- sort of ethos around this, and I've talked about this often. But in care, we want to provide a better experience at a lower cost. So our expectation is that care is a line item will continue to leverage, and we will continue to provide a better and better and better experience for our customers. And one of the ways that we're doing that is by having better technology in care. That makes our guides more successful, that makes our customers more successful, and while retaining some of the secret sauce of care that we have as a company.\nJosh Beck: Really helpful. Thanks so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ella Smith on for Alexi Gogolev at JPMorgan. Ella please go ahead.\nAman Bhutani: Hey, Ella.\nElla Smith: Hi, Aman. Hi, Mark. Hi, Christie. Hope you are all doing well. So first, I have yet another question on Airo for you. So Aman, Airo is clearly a powerful open to all gram for new customers and it's clearly driving bookings. How are you balancing that with your ambitions to monetize the products? And when might monetization begin?\nAman Bhutani: Ella, thanks for the question. We -- our first goal is to being the largest mode of discovery and engagement. We want to be able to spend against Airo and build a virtuous cycle, a flywheel, if you will, where customers get care about Airo. They come in, they discover the set of products we have and they engage and buy into those products. That has a really good flywheel effect where it drives average order size up and it allows us to bid more in marketing to bring more customers to our site, right? And that's a lovely flywheel that can build on itself. So that's the first thing that we're trying to build in. And for us, the way to build it well is to focus on discovery and engagement and then monetization. In terms of monetization, absolutely super excited about it. Our teams are -- in fact, I would say, ahead on some of the monetization experiments versus what we had originally designed. It's great to see our become a great on-ramp for websites plus marketing. We wanted to become a great on-ramp for other products, too. Great. But it has to follow the discovery and engagement cycle, because I would love to be able to sit here and give you numbers on discovery and engagement that are much larger than where we are today. And these numbers are pretty large and fantastic as is, but I think they can be much bigger.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And I think when you think about our overall framework, we're always trying to make sure we're heading towards our North Star that we talk about free cash flow. And that means balancing our investments with where we see the return and making sure we're doing it to drive LTV and shareholder value over the longer term without trying to push ourselves into a specific area too quickly that would basically jeopardize that over the long term.\nElla Smith: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you both so much. And as -- and for my follow-up, we saw news at the end of the day that you launched a reseller program. Can you shed some light on the strategic thinking around that program and how the economics will look like?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. The reseller program is just about the maturity of our products, Ella. It's pretty simple from, I would say, a natural progression of our product capabilities. You can imagine, as our products -- let's take the example of website plus marketing, where we did do a press release around APIs being available as an example. You can think of websites marketing, not only the fantastic website builder, it's sort of the number one in terms of producing the best sites. If you're building website plus marketing, it's going to build a very, very capable website for you that will perform very well in Google. But how do you sort of expand beyond the folks that are coming to you? And the natural extension is to be able to put give some of those capabilities into partner systems. And the best way to do it is through APIs. But what we have as an advantage as a company is not only exposing those APIs for website plus marketing, but we're able to leave in APIs that power other things that Airo can bring into the mix, right? So just like we're going out to customers directly, and we're exposing them to Airo and looking at discovery and engagement the reseller program or the APIs our way of trying to sort of work with partners and say, let's see what we can do given our expanded capabilities, given our expanded tool set where our product offering can show up natively in our partner experiences.\nElla Smith: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you. This is Chand [ph] on for Brent Thill. Two questions. One, as you made the Airo available in over 180 countries, just wondering if you could talk about what's been, how the response has been different versus, let's say the initial launch within the U.S. Any sort of change difference in behavior or attach? And then the second question is around the normalized EBITDA margin. Obviously, that's been expanding faster than expected. And your goal is still 33% in '26. So it seems like that looks very likely to overshoot that. Wondering if there are any factors why that may not be, why we shouldn't be extrapolating from here? Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Maybe I can take the first one, and Mark, you can take the second one. So on the launch of Airo, John, the way we look at it is that we've got the U.S. market, which is obviously where we started in our largest market, and we've shared some of the data with you on how well that is going. The next stage is the English-speaking markets. These are our bigger markets around the world, just what you would expect them to be like Canada, U.K., Australia, right? And then we have a set of developed markets and, I would say, emerging markets. And it's too early to talk about sort of those emerging markets. And how Airo is going to perform there. It's still relatively new as an off rate. But in the broader English-speaking markets, we're actually taking the learnings from the U.S. and looking to apply them in all the other English-speaking markets. And of course, we expect it to perform maybe not exactly the same, but at a similar level in those markets.\nMark McCaffrey: And then I'll just -- on the normalized EBITDA, we've talked about the three buckets that are a tailwind to get us to the 33% in 2026. We've talked about the acceleration of A&C being a big part of the picture. We've talked about the infrastructure simplifications. We also talked about the global talent pools. We're really happy on our accomplishments, especially around some of the front-loaded elements of this. If you remember, we took restructurings last year that now are really showing up into our expansion of normalized EBITDA this year. Some of that was front-end loaded. So we'll start to see continued benefit in those three buckets to get to the 33%. We feel really comfortable with that. But we did see some of that front-loaded related to the restructuring.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Zhang from UBS. Chris, please go ahead.\nAman Bhutani: Chris?\nChris Zhang: There's a button to click. All right thanks for taking our question. So how do we think about -- how should we think about your investment needs in 2025 versus 2024 in addition to the market investments? Can you maybe just rank order a couple of areas you're focusing on next year? And then I have a follow-up?\nMark McCaffrey: Well, Chris, we'll talk about 2025, when we get to Q4 earnings. No doubtedly we'll give some details of where we think things like our investments are going to be. But there are areas we talked about on this call. Marketing is one of them. We continue to see the ability to accelerate Airo. We see the customer engagements and the behaviors around it. And then we also think about, I always say there are two important things within our growth, which is innovation and owning the customer relationship. And those are about what we spend to innovate and meet our customers' needs and things like our care organization. We see great leverage across those lines, but we'll continue to invest in what the future is to drive the long-term value.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Maybe just add to this quick short summary is that our Investor Day framework is still intact, right? We're making great progress on it. We're working to maximize free cash flow and the components of it to 6% to 8% growth and 33% margin in '26. Those continue to sort of be the path.\nChris Zhang: All right. Sounds great. I appreciate the color. And I guess, as it relates to marketing investments specifically, maybe can you share with us what guardrails you're applying to determine the label of your spend? Or maybe just directionally how that differs from among the various product offerings in your A&C portfolio?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. On the marketing spend, we've invested in sort of very good guardrails driven by data and machine learning that gives us great commentary [ph] on our marketing spend and return on it. And our goal is to stay within our guidance range, what we're really building is the opportunity to drive more discovery for Airo, drive more engagement with Airo and get some of those returns and then be able to reinvest them back in. So it's really about sort of kickstarting that flywheel with a great product suite we have in place now.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And our disciplined approach hasn't changed around this. It's about measuring the ROIs and making sure that we feel comfortable that where we invest, we will get that disciplined ROI we always talk about.\nChris Zhang: All right. Sounds great. Thank you for your color. And look forward to seeing your team in Arizona.\nAman Bhutani: You too.\nMark McCaffrey: You too.\nChristie Masoner: The next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yes, hi. Thanks a lot. So I got a couple of questions. One is this 40% of paid develop subscribers coming originating through Airo. That's pretty impressive. I'm just wondering how that share that comes through Airo has kind of trended over the last three or four quarters, since this Airo has been kind of live. So that's one. And the second question I have is just around the on ramps. So now that you're extending Airo into the sort of website first kind of on ramp, I'm trying to just kind of think about the relative size of the on-ramps for the business? How should -- what's the right way to think about domains versus websites.\nAman Bhutani: The share for Airo over the last few months -- we're not orders. We don't have orders of data its months, right. Over the last few months have been increasing, but obviously accelerated by some of the payroll work, right. And then is going to take a couple of quarters to see how the payroll performance with our regular TAT. The number jumping to 40% is a clear signal that customers looking forward just to have and all liking it. So that is a positive. In terms of the size of the different on ramps. Ultimately what we plan to do is doing all the [indiscernible] together with Airo, right. We're trying to take these things that today are different and make them very similar for the customer and the future doesn't had what product they've bought. They actually end up being Airo.\nNaved Khan: Got it. I actually meant to say quarters not months, thanks for correcting me. Where do you think this could land as you continue to kind of own the offering and improve it you think it's nor the 50%, just high level thoughts there?\nAman Bhutani: I think we're just starting on Airo. So we're not in the year end. We have celebrated the first year anniversary for Airo, which took us very early. I think we have [indiscernible] for Airo and just looking forward to what -- how far we can go ahead. It's frankly too early for us that we see an [indiscernible] the percentage quickly there.\nNaved Khan: Great, thanks so much.\nChristie Masoner: Our last question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello, thanks for taking the questions. So first, I wanted to ask about specifically a call out in the prepared remarks about the 46% of EBITDA margin A&C being driven by the strength of high gross margin proprietary solutions. I just wanted to ask, is that principally website and marketing? Or is there any other kind of driver in that bucket of proprietary solutions? And then as a follow-up, there is a pretty notable market event in the last quarter, a disagreement between a Managed WordPress vendor and the largest contributor to WordPress. Aman, do you see that as largely irrelevant to the long-term progress WordPress? Have you seen any kind of conversation in your customers or partners that have reacted to that out to that event? Any kind of thoughts on that would be really appreciated. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Happy to take that. And you generally knew about it correctly in terms of the high margin products, the proprietary systems the ones we build and [Technical Difficulty] higher margin. And then the third-party products that we still tend to be a little bit lower margin rate versus the first step. Now if you sort of stack them together, of course, websites with marketing ranks very, very high in the -- all of that work is done internally, and we're able to sort of put that product forward in a very, very competitive manner. In terms of the broader question about WordPress, as you are aware, WordPress is the largest content management system in the world, right, over 40% of websites run on it. I give tremendous credit to everyone that's part of that immense success story. And we as GoDaddy we are the top 3 or top 5 contributor to WordPress depending on how you calculate contributions. There's a bunch of public data on it. So we are for the WordPress community. We are part of the WordPress community, and we believe that WordPress is here to stay. Our focus really is to build magical experiences on top of WordPress. And I'm actually excited to show you conversational WordPress at our Investor Dinner which takes the harnesses the power and massive capability that WordPress has and allows our customers to do things with it without meeting the technical expertise to do it. So those are the things that we're really interested in is to take this massively capable platform and bring it to sort of empower our customers to sort of do amazing things with it.\nClarke Jeffries: Thank you very much.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Clarke.\nChristie Masoner: I'll now turn the call over to Aman for closing remarks.\nAman Bhutani: Just a quick mention. Thank you to all GoDaddy employees for another great quarter, and I appreciate how everyone has worked hard and looking forward to the next few quarters and years. Thank you.",

            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy is relentlessly focused on creating customer value and transforming it to shareholder value through better conversion, attach and retention. This is the driving force behind our profitable growth model, propelling us towards our north star of maximizing free cash flow over the long-term. Our strong Q3 results demonstrate our effective execution of this strategy, delivering both innovation and operational efficiency. We drove meaningful growth in free cash flow increasing 29% year-over-year, and application and commerce bookings were up 20% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded by over 400 basis points. We are excited to share updates on our growth and margin initiatives driving success in 2024. Pricing in bundling, seamless experience, commerce and cost optimization are all ahead of schedule, driving the strong results mentioned. The enthusiasm for GoDaddy Airo continues to vibrate within our teams. And along with an update today, we are looking forward to more live demos at our investor dinner in early December. Pricing and bundling continues to deliver solid results with productivity-focused efforts remaining a key contributor to the 20% application and commerce bookings growth this quarter. As we have said before, we view the pricing and bundling initiative as a multiyear journey that leverages our software platforms, vast data and machine learning capabilities allowing us to bundle solutions in a way that offers greater value to customers with pricing aligned to the value delivered. While our efforts this year have been concentrated on productivity solutions, we will expand the initiative across more of our product suite, extending this initiative beyond the application and commerce segment. Putting a finer point on this, this means the financial impact of pricing and bundling can favorably drive growth in both A&C and Core platform segments starting in Q4. Our seamless experience initiative exceeded expectations as we continue to remove friction in the customer experience and improve purchase, onboarding and renewal path. Given our scale, even modest improvements in conversion and renewal can yield meaningful results. In Managed WordPress, we added security enhancements to all new domains attached to the platform as well as expanded AI-powered features, making it easier for customers to build and manage their websites. Additionally, with the recent launch of the GoDaddy Digital Marketing Suite, we are giving customers an intuitive all in one product to help grow and market their businesses regardless of where their website is hosted. Features like these empower our customers to better acquire, engage and expand their own customer base. For our commerce initiative, we continue to enhance our offering by introducing new AI-powered features that simplify operations for merchants. The two new SaaS plans we launched last quarter, Point-Of-Sale Plus and Invoicing Plus have had positive adoption trends since being fully rolled out. We have set aggressive attached targets, and the team is making progress against them. Finally, within our cost optimization initiative, we augmented care interactions in 20 international markets with our new generative AI-powered conversational bot providing our customers with better instant self-service access to solutions for common issues. We found that use of this technology led to double-digit improvement in containment rates, representing a savings of over 16 million incremental contact minutes without sacrificing customer satisfaction. We are excited with the progress on the conversational bot and along with GABI, we expect these to continue to drive leverage in care while delivering a better experience globally. And Airo is starting to provide a magical experience to customers that we aspire to provide across every interaction. It is a compelling proof point to our multiple year journey to successfully leverage our software platform and unleash the combined power of our infrastructure, large-scale data, experimentation, AI and machine learning capabilities. With the capabilities of Airo, we evolved the domain to represent so much more. It is now a gateway to a true business-in-a-box experience, allowing our customers to go from idea to online in minutes. Our teams are moving at a fast pace even before celebrating the one-year anniversary of the initial customer testing for Airo, it was available in over 180 countries globally. Nearly 3 million customers have discovered Airo with over half of them engaging with the experience. We are pleased with the momentum in discovery and engagement and just as exciting are the proof points we are driving in Airo monetization. With many months of data, we can clearly see that the largest engagement winner is website building. Over half of engaged users published a coming soon page, which is a customizable one page website. Customers engaged with Airo are quickly becoming the largest funnel for websites plus marketing with over 40% of websites plus marketing paid subscriptions in Q3 originating with the Airo experience. Our goals with Airo are about discovery, engagement and monetization. And with these large discovery and engagement numbers and multiple paths to monetization, Airo is off to a great start. And there is so much more we can do given the positive traction we are eager to expand the Airo experience across all on-ramps at GoDaddy, and we plan to increase investment in marketing initiatives to support this broader launch. So far, the customer exposed to Airo starts with a domain purchase. And in the next few weeks, we will start rolling out Airo to customers that start with a website purchase. Just as websites have become the highest attached product for domains on Airo, we expect to drive attach with other products when every website customer starts with an Airo experience. This underscores our commitment to rapidly scaling products enabled by Airo as it continues to transform the customer experience and drive new avenues of growth. We look forward to showing you more during our upcoming investor dinner event on December 3. We plan to showcase paid tiers for Airo with premium offerings like advanced logos and imagery as well as AI-powered marketing tools to help our customers grow their businesses. Equally exciting, we will highlight our conversational experience to building and maintaining word press sites, which reimagines harnessing the power of WordPress through a simplified intuitive interface. We will also demo our site optimizer tool, which can inspect any website and provide actionable recommendations to improve performance with just a click. While these products themselves will be brand new, they represent our continued focus on leveraging AI and machine learning and our unique scale and data to deliver magical seamless experiences for our customers. We are thrilled to give you a first look at these innovations that will drive our growth and success in the future. In closing, we remain steadfastly focused on executing our key growth initiatives. I am delighted with the speed of execution and our relentless commitment to help our customers thrive. The GoDaddy team remains dedicated to propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. Yes. Thanks, Trevor. I can take the pricing in one-line approach. As we've talked about, pricing and bundling is about finding the right cohorts of customers, where we can provide the right value to customers and then price along with that value. And the way we do this is that we experiment at different price points of find the price elasticity curve. And then what that curve helps us do is find the right cohorts where we can sort of balance attrition for customers, right, or let's say, retention of customers with the pricing opportunity in front of us. And that's a great balance. Right at the company, we want to drive as much growth as we can while maintaining our high customer retention rates. So for pricing and bundling, that approach of using machine learning, using experimentation, using the scale of our data and our competitive advantages there, we can direct that way of working across our product suite and cohorts within that product suite. So what we're really -- what I'm really talking about here is that we have identified other cohorts of customers that we will be applying this approach to. And some of those are going to have products that sit in the Core Platform, which is now going to take sort of the benefit of pricing and bundling across both the segments. Yes. Look, we're super excited, Ken, about the product portfolio we have in play right now, brought together by Airo, just an almost magical experience for our customers. We've got the product rolled out, we've always had sort of very good guardrails for our marketing spend. But given the product offering that we have, there's an opportunity for us to spend up in marketing, and we do expect to get more customers as a result of that. And like Mark said, there is a normalization of the divestitures and some of the actions we've taken. It also includes some actions that we took with viral offers that we have out there, and we're going to lapse on that too. And just to confirm, I think you have the sort of A&C comparatives from last year for Q3 and Q4, and you can see the sort of step up in Q4 comps that happens. Thank you. Hey, Ygal. Yes. Thanks, Ygal. So the progress with Airo goes on a time line of discovery, engagement and monetization. And Discovery is about getting Airo in front of as many customers as possible and getting them to just discover that GoDaddy has a breadth of products available to them. The engagement piece is about getting them to engage in some of those products. And you'll remember that we call those Airo cards, getting customers to click on them, engage with them, set something up. And we're seeing really good traction on discovery and engagement. And what we did over the last quarter or two is that we started to put up paywalls where along with that engagement, if, for example, a customer got a coming soon page and wanted -- and was able to customize it a little bit, if they wanted to do more a paywall would appear and say, you need to buy subscription or websites plus marketing. Now it is possible that, that customer would have bought it anyway, two months, three months down the line, and we would have gotten that attach. But what Airo offers is the ability for us to paywall right there, get the customer to make that decision. And that paywall is actually connected to the 40% that I talked about today. And what that is about is that Airo is becoming a bigger and bigger on-ramp for our website products. And today, we have two in Airo. We have a coming soon page is doing really well and we have websites plus marketing subscription. And as Airo becomes a bigger on-ramp, Yes, of course, we're happy to see that monetization happens, but what that opens up in the future is paywalls an opportunity to sell other products because we do see in the customer behavior that customers have a need for the other offerings that we have. It's just that today, they don't discover those offerings. They don't engage with those offerings, and they definitely don't see a monetization for it. But Airo is going to let us do that, which is follow the customers, they have those subsequent needs with the paywalls in front of them. So this website paywall story is a very good story. It's a new -- it's, of course, an only story, and it's the first big one for Airo. But we have similar work in logos. We have similar work in images. These are things we're going to demo at the investor dinner. We have some work happening with palings that come with Airo and a couple of the others as well. Yes. Our pricing and bundling, the folks working on it really have the ability to test across various customer cohorts and what they're looking for are the cohorts where we can generate the best results fastest. And the best result here means creating that customer value, and then being able to monetize that value as well. So when I look across our products, we have other products to go that are much larger in terms of the base of customers. So we think that those likely are going to offer some of the better opportunities, but we'll keep you informed just like we did with productivity. I think you remember last year, we did apply this thinking to multiple products. And then we said, what you're going to see stronger or a large chunk of the return come from productivity, because we're going to zone in on that because that's where we see the opportunity. Similarly, as we go over the next few quarters, we'll sort of guide you better on where we're seeing that return. But our testing this year as we plan for next year is going well. And one of the things that we have shared today is that we see ourselves going across customer cohorts that now will be in A&C and in Core. So you'll likely see a little bit different behavior going into next year than you did this year. Thank you. Yes. Overall, on the macro, we track the metrics I think we've talked about before and sort of, if I look at my dashboard, generally, we see some good, but we're keeping a close eye on things, specially election in the U.S. coming off. But broadly speaking, what I would say is when we think about our customer base, and Mark always likes to talk about our high attention, and I'm sure you will jump in with that. We're absolutely proud of that. But when we look at traffic coming in the door, we continue to see good gross adds. We continue to see good traffic coming to the site. And in pockets and those pockets can be geographic, those pockets can be sort of different customer segments. In pockets where we do see some sort of weakness, that's more than made up by how we've improved conversion, how we've improved pricing, all the sort of mechanics that we're applying within our seamless experience initiative. So I feel if there are a few, those are more than overcome. But broadly speaking, we continue to get good traffic, continue to get good gross adds and continue to maintain our higher retention rate for customers at 85%. Yes, Elizabeth. It's a little too early to sort of putting numbers on it. But we will definitely talk more about it in the next quarter's call and from there. Generally speaking, our approach is the same. The way we're using the data, the way we're cohorting customers, the way we're testing the price elasticity curve, the way we're creating it, the way we sort of decide where to go on it. All of that methodology is similar, but it takes us really sort of getting into that customer cohort in a few weeks of executing that plan to really see what it's going to be. What we do see so far is that we are ready to start on it in Q4, but likely it will take a quarter or more for us to get that run rate going where we can talk about it with a little bit more data than we have today. Thanks, Josh. Discovery is definitely an important metric, because without the discovery metric we can't feel confident that our customers are seeing the breadth of our products, both new and existing products. But if you had to sort of fall in on one metric and say, hey, which is the one that we really are focused on optimizing on. It's really the engagement metric that we want to keep very, very healthy, and it is very, very healthy, because as we spend in marketing, discovery will definitely go up, but we don't want engagement as a percentage of drop downs. We want customers engage with this because we have data for 25 years, and we know just from our own data and the data of other companies that the engaged customers enter the monetization phase in a much more favorable manner than non-engaged customers, right? Metrics like attached conversion, do much, much better for engaged users than they do for non-engaged users. So that's if you will, that is the quality metric. That's the thing that makes sure that our efforts are valuable and are going to create more value in the future. While I'm very happy about the multiple paths monetization for Airo, and we'll show you the paywalls and the teams are doing good stuff. And the website paywall doing well and even sort of monetization on coming soon and other being great opportunities for us. I would say, overall, in our three year plan at the Investor Day earlier this year, we purposefully put Airo outside of the three year planning, because we wanted to build a very large mode of discovery and engagement. Because that very large mode of discovery and engagement will, we believe, generate sort of recurrence for years to come. Yes. containment rate is like a deflection rate. It really points to the sessions where a customer asked the question and the conversational bot was able to answer the customer's question in a satisfactory manner, and that been resolved in sort of a chat being forwarded to a human agent. So seeing that sort of double-digit percentage increase in the bot being able to resolve the customer query or issues is a great first step. And look, of course, whether it's this or our guide assist part, which we call GABI, these are relatively new technologies. They're off to a great start we see great momentum in those over the next two to three years. It's our sort of our -- sort of ethos around this, and I've talked about this often. But in care, we want to provide a better experience at a lower cost. So our expectation is that care is a line item will continue to leverage, and we will continue to provide a better and better and better experience for our customers. And one of the ways that we're doing that is by having better technology in care. That makes our guides more successful, that makes our customers more successful, and while retaining some of the secret sauce of care that we have as a company. Hey, Ella. Ella, thanks for the question. We -- our first goal is to being the largest mode of discovery and engagement. We want to be able to spend against Airo and build a virtuous cycle, a flywheel, if you will, where customers get care about Airo. They come in, they discover the set of products we have and they engage and buy into those products. That has a really good flywheel effect where it drives average order size up and it allows us to bid more in marketing to bring more customers to our site, right? And that's a lovely flywheel that can build on itself. So that's the first thing that we're trying to build in. And for us, the way to build it well is to focus on discovery and engagement and then monetization. In terms of monetization, absolutely super excited about it. Our teams are -- in fact, I would say, ahead on some of the monetization experiments versus what we had originally designed. It's great to see our become a great on-ramp for websites plus marketing. We wanted to become a great on-ramp for other products, too. Great. But it has to follow the discovery and engagement cycle, because I would love to be able to sit here and give you numbers on discovery and engagement that are much larger than where we are today. And these numbers are pretty large and fantastic as is, but I think they can be much bigger. Yes. The reseller program is just about the maturity of our products, Ella. It's pretty simple from, I would say, a natural progression of our product capabilities. You can imagine, as our products -- let's take the example of website plus marketing, where we did do a press release around APIs being available as an example. You can think of websites marketing, not only the fantastic website builder, it's sort of the number one in terms of producing the best sites. If you're building website plus marketing, it's going to build a very, very capable website for you that will perform very well in Google. But how do you sort of expand beyond the folks that are coming to you? And the natural extension is to be able to put give some of those capabilities into partner systems. And the best way to do it is through APIs. But what we have as an advantage as a company is not only exposing those APIs for website plus marketing, but we're able to leave in APIs that power other things that Airo can bring into the mix, right? So just like we're going out to customers directly, and we're exposing them to Airo and looking at discovery and engagement the reseller program or the APIs our way of trying to sort of work with partners and say, let's see what we can do given our expanded capabilities, given our expanded tool set where our product offering can show up natively in our partner experiences. Thank you. Yes. Maybe I can take the first one, and Mark, you can take the second one. So on the launch of Airo, John, the way we look at it is that we've got the U.S. market, which is obviously where we started in our largest market, and we've shared some of the data with you on how well that is going. The next stage is the English-speaking markets. These are our bigger markets around the world, just what you would expect them to be like Canada, U.K., Australia, right? And then we have a set of developed markets and, I would say, emerging markets. And it's too early to talk about sort of those emerging markets. And how Airo is going to perform there. It's still relatively new as an off rate. But in the broader English-speaking markets, we're actually taking the learnings from the U.S. and looking to apply them in all the other English-speaking markets. And of course, we expect it to perform maybe not exactly the same, but at a similar level in those markets. Chris? Yes. Maybe just add to this quick short summary is that our Investor Day framework is still intact, right? We're making great progress on it. We're working to maximize free cash flow and the components of it to 6% to 8% growth and 33% margin in '26. Those continue to sort of be the path. Yes. On the marketing spend, we've invested in sort of very good guardrails driven by data and machine learning that gives us great commentary [ph] on our marketing spend and return on it. And our goal is to stay within our guidance range, what we're really building is the opportunity to drive more discovery for Airo, drive more engagement with Airo and get some of those returns and then be able to reinvest them back in. So it's really about sort of kickstarting that flywheel with a great product suite we have in place now. You too. The share for Airo over the last few months -- we're not orders. We don't have orders of data its months, right. Over the last few months have been increasing, but obviously accelerated by some of the payroll work, right. And then is going to take a couple of quarters to see how the payroll performance with our regular TAT. The number jumping to 40% is a clear signal that customers looking forward just to have and all liking it. So that is a positive. In terms of the size of the different on ramps. Ultimately what we plan to do is doing all the [indiscernible] together with Airo, right. We're trying to take these things that today are different and make them very similar for the customer and the future doesn't had what product they've bought. They actually end up being Airo. I think we're just starting on Airo. So we're not in the year end. We have celebrated the first year anniversary for Airo, which took us very early. I think we have [indiscernible] for Airo and just looking forward to what -- how far we can go ahead. It's frankly too early for us that we see an [indiscernible] the percentage quickly there. Yes. Happy to take that. And you generally knew about it correctly in terms of the high margin products, the proprietary systems the ones we build and [Technical Difficulty] higher margin. And then the third-party products that we still tend to be a little bit lower margin rate versus the first step. Now if you sort of stack them together, of course, websites with marketing ranks very, very high in the -- all of that work is done internally, and we're able to sort of put that product forward in a very, very competitive manner. In terms of the broader question about WordPress, as you are aware, WordPress is the largest content management system in the world, right, over 40% of websites run on it. I give tremendous credit to everyone that's part of that immense success story. And we as GoDaddy we are the top 3 or top 5 contributor to WordPress depending on how you calculate contributions. There's a bunch of public data on it. So we are for the WordPress community. We are part of the WordPress community, and we believe that WordPress is here to stay. Our focus really is to build magical experiences on top of WordPress. And I'm actually excited to show you conversational WordPress at our Investor Dinner which takes the harnesses the power and massive capability that WordPress has and allows our customers to do things with it without meeting the technical expertise to do it. So those are the things that we're really interested in is to take this massively capable platform and bring it to sort of empower our customers to sort of do amazing things with it. Thank you, Clarke. Just a quick mention. Thank you to all GoDaddy employees for another great quarter, and I appreciate how everyone has worked hard and looking forward to the next few quarters and years. Thank you."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. We delivered strong Q3 results, demonstrating our disciplined execution of the strategy we shared at our recent Investor Day. Our focus on building increasing customer lifetime value through developing and delivering seamless technology that drives conversion, attach and retention is demonstrated in our financial results. In the third quarter, we drove sustained double-digit A&C revenue growth, increasing 16% as well as impressive normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 32%. We made progress toward our North Star, growing free cash flow 29% to $363 million. In addition, we continued to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which focused on share buybacks, reducing our fully diluted shares outstanding to $144 million. Total revenue grew to $1.15 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis. For our high-margin A&C segment, we drove 20% growth in bookings and 16% growth in revenue to $423 million, in line with our guided range on the strong performance of the growth initiatives Aman spoke about earlier. The segment EBITDA margin for A&C improved to 46% on the strength of our high gross margin proprietary solutions partially offset by the strong performance and lower gross margin profiles of our commerce offerings and third-party solutions. A&C segment EBITDA was also boosted by significant leverage gains across all operating expenses. Our proactive effort to simplify our infrastructure and recruit global talent were the main driving factors behind this strength. In addition, ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 15% to $1.6 billion. We delivered $725 million of revenue for our Core Platform segment representing growth in revenue and bookings of 3%, in line with our guided range. Performance this quarter reflected the strength in primary domains partially offset by hosting divestitures and end-of-life migrations. Segment EBITDA margin for the Core Platform grew to 33% and ARR for our Core Platform segment grew 4% to $2.4 billion. ARPU grew 8% to $215 on a trailing 12-months basis, while our customer count declined slightly to $20.7 million. With the previously mentioned divestiture and migration efforts behind us, we expect to return to customer growth in 2025. Currently, our consolidated customer retention rate remains at 85% and over 50% of our customers have two or more paid products with us. Moving to profitability. We drove expansion in normalized EBITDA in the third quarter, growing 24% and to $367 million and delivering an expanded margin of 32%, up over 400 basis points. This was driven by the gross margin tailwind noted above, coupled with operational discipline that drove leverage in our P&L. The front-loaded benefits of our 2023 restructuring, infrastructure simplification and global talent recruitment are evident, and we are pleased with these accomplishments. As we look forward, we remain on track to deliver our Investor Day targets of approximately 33% by 2026. Additionally, as we look to the upcoming quarters, we expect to increase investment in marketing to support our broader launch of our Airo enabled solutions to showcase our top-rated AI website builder and capture customer demand. On bookings, we delivered $1.2 billion in the third quarter representing 9% growth on both a reported and a constant currency basis. As a reminder, bookings primarily represents the cash collected during the period. Subscription bookings grew 2 points ahead of subscription revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 25% to $399 million, and free cash flow grew 29% to $363 million. Capital expenditures were down approximately 46% because of data center divestitures. Through October 28, we repurchased 5.2 million shares year-to-date, totaling $668 million. We repurchased 39.4 million shares for $3.2 billion under our current authorizations, and we have $767 million remaining. We drove a 23% reduction in gross shares outstanding since January 2022, 3 points ahead of our three-year targeted reduction of 20%. At the quarter end, 144 million fully diluted shares remain outstanding. On our balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $767 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt was $3.1 billion, representing a net leverage of 2x on a trailing 12-month basis. Pivoting to our outlook. We are raising the full-year revenue guide to $4.545 billion to $4.565 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint of our range. For the fourth quarter, we are targeting revenue between $1.165 billion and $1.185 billion, also representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. In Applications & Commerce, we expect mid-teens revenue growth for Q4 and the full-year. In Core Platform, we expect low single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full-year. As our track record demonstrates, we are committed to maintaining our operational discipline driving further operational leverage in our model and expanding margins. Including the additional marketing investment we expect to make in the fourth quarter, we remain on course to deliver a 31% normalized EBITDA margin. Given our year-to-date performance, we are also raising our full-year normalized EBITDA expectation to 30%, keeping in mind our nearly 1:1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio, we are also raising our unlevered free cash flow target to $1.475 billion plus and free cash flow to $1.325 billion plus for the full-year. Our disciplined capital allocation approach remains unchanged, and we will evaluate all opportunities for shareholder return according to our rigorous and returns-based framework. We are committed to the path we outlined at our Investor Day, executing our strategy to deliver both durable top line growth and expanded profitability as we drive toward our North Star. Our robust cash generation, strong balance sheet and capital allocation framework underpin our investment thesis and power our ability to create enduring value for our shareholders. We are pleased with our progress towards our Investor Day target of $4.5 billion plus in cumulative free cash flow generation supported by 6% to 8% annual revenue growth and expansion of our normalized EBITDA margin to 33% by 2026. Lastly, we look forward to welcoming you to our annual investor dinner on December 3 in our new Tempe, Arizona headquarters. I will now turn the call over to our Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Christie Masoner, to open the call for your questions. Thanks, Vik. And a couple of things, right? One, yes, bookings acceleration can be a tailwind for us in revenue. So that is a factual statement. Things to consider when we're really looking at the difference between the two is the timing with -- especially with our A&C, we have multiple different timing depending on the product mix within that group. For example, transactional and commerce. We have monthly terms. We have annual terms. We have multiyear terms. Do you really have to look at it on a broad spectrum of what products are being sold, what the mix is. And yes, it will help our -- be a tailwind for us on revenue in general. We're really excited about the momentum. Obviously, we'll talk a little bit more when we get to the Q4 earnings call about 2025. But we're comfortable with the 6% to 8% growth we talked about over the three years. We do think for the year, overall bookings will outpace revenue by about 2 points and that is obviously being pushed a lot by the A&C. Thanks, Vik. And Trevor on aftermarket, yes. Just a reminder, it's a volatile business. We think over time, it will be a low single-digit dollar. And we always talk about there could be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, it was down slightly. Nothing to call out in and of itself. We saw some pressure on valuations at the lower level, all of the demand seem to continue. And again, we don't control the pricing on the aftermarket. It's a buyer to seller green pricing. So again, thesis still holds. We believe it will be a low single-digit grower over time, and we'll see a little bit of variability in the quarter-to-quarter and we'll just call it out. Thanks. Yes. So the first part of it is, yes, it was just to call out that we are lapping the divestitures, the integrations and the end-of-life we've talked about previously. And as we start to lap them throughout this year, net customer adds will have -- that headwind will go away. And Aman, if you want to comment on the marketing, what we talked about. Yes. So higher level, obviously, as we go into Q4 and into 2025, the strength of A&C will get harder to compare to. So on a percentage basis, we like the momentum overall that will continue. But obviously, the percentage comps get a little harder as we go on into next year. Yes. And just to add, when you take out the divestitures, when you take out the decisions we made around virals, and we look at the strong top of the funnel, what we are seeing is customers coming in with intent and how are we seeing it? Well, our ARPU is increasing, our ARPU is being driven by higher average order sizes from our customers when they initiate with us at the beginning. We see our customers attaching overall at a faster rate than they did years ago. So when you really peel through the ins and the outs of the customers, take out the divestitures, turn off the virals, we're seeing very strong behavior with intent at the front of the funnel. Now we are always subject things like valuations in aftermarket, and we've talked about that a lot, but the overall behavior of the funnel and the attachment is strong. So I heard the deceleration part there, and I'll address that. And maybe if you can -- if you had another part to that, let me know it was cutting out. So on the deceleration, it's tougher comps. We went from Q2 comparison in '23 to Q3 comparison in '23. It was just the most difficult comps. The momentum in and of itself is the same. All right. Thank you. Hey, Elizabeth. Yes. And Elizabeth, nothing to change what we've put out there as guidance for Q4. We're talking about the initial steps of it, and then we'll talk about 2025 when we get to the fourth quarter earnings call. Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. And just a couple of high level comments. In Q3, we benefited from a favorable product mix. Generally, we think our gross margins are going to be around 64%, give or take a 100 basis points. We saw a favorable mix within Q3. We saw -- for example, aftermarket was down about 1%, and that's a lower margin business for us. As we see our higher margin proprietary software be a better part of the mix. Our margins will lean towards the high side. If we see transactional having strength, we'll see that towards lowers on. So again, there will be product mix in there that will determine or impact on the gross margin. We had seen some front-loaded benefits from some of the restructuring simplification efforts we had, global recruitment we talked about hit into Q3. Those were front-end loaded and we'll continue to see those. And then the rest is what we alluded to was the timing. We just had timing of expenses like marketing that we'll see start to pick up a little more in Q4, still on target for the 31% we talked about, but some of that was just the timing and the expenses and how they're hitting. Yes. And I think when you think about our overall framework, we're always trying to make sure we're heading towards our North Star that we talk about free cash flow. And that means balancing our investments with where we see the return and making sure we're doing it to drive LTV and shareholder value over the longer term without trying to push ourselves into a specific area too quickly that would basically jeopardize that over the long term. And then I'll just -- on the normalized EBITDA, we've talked about the three buckets that are a tailwind to get us to the 33% in 2026. We've talked about the acceleration of A&C being a big part of the picture. We've talked about the infrastructure simplifications. We also talked about the global talent pools. We're really happy on our accomplishments, especially around some of the front-loaded elements of this. If you remember, we took restructurings last year that now are really showing up into our expansion of normalized EBITDA this year. Some of that was front-end loaded. So we'll start to see continued benefit in those three buckets to get to the 33%. We feel really comfortable with that. But we did see some of that front-loaded related to the restructuring. Well, Chris, we'll talk about 2025, when we get to Q4 earnings. No doubtedly we'll give some details of where we think things like our investments are going to be. But there are areas we talked about on this call. Marketing is one of them. We continue to see the ability to accelerate Airo. We see the customer engagements and the behaviors around it. And then we also think about, I always say there are two important things within our growth, which is innovation and owning the customer relationship. And those are about what we spend to innovate and meet our customers' needs and things like our care organization. We see great leverage across those lines, but we'll continue to invest in what the future is to drive the long-term value. Yes. And our disciplined approach hasn't changed around this. It's about measuring the ROIs and making sure that we feel comfortable that where we invest, we will get that disciplined ROI we always talk about. You too."

And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating and business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. Growth rates represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today August 1, 2024. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that I'm pleased to introduce Aman.\nAman Bhutani: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our customers are a constant source of inspiration. One customer who has been with us for over 10 years runs a recruiting services company wrote to us recently and said, in today's business environment having partners that add real value is easier said than done. I'm happy to have GoDaddy on my extended business team. That is our goal to be the extended business team for millions of micro businesses. Our strategy is relentlessly focused on creating customer value and transforming it to shareholder value through better conversion, attach and retention. Our profitable growth model drives our North Star to maximize free cash flow over the long-term. The GoDaddy team is executing against this plan to drive innovation and operational efficiency leading to our strong Q2 results. This includes meaningful expansion of free cash flow delivering 35% growth. Additionally, Applications and Commerce bookings grew 24% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points. Our key growth and margin initiatives are driven by the innovation powered by the GoDaddy software platform. Our aspiration is to deliver seamlessly intuitive experiences that start to be magical and this is fueled by GoDaddy's unique scale and data. GoDaddy Airo, our AI-powered experience is one of the results of this aspiration. I am excited about Airo's ability to reinvent multiple interactions with our customers from domain search to insights on how they can improve their websites to growing their businesses. Airo is now rolled out to all new and existing customers across our English-speaking markets and it is poised for further expansion into over 90 countries in the coming months. Airo has already transformed the experience for our new customers. In Q2, we passed an exciting milestone. Over one million new customers have discovered Airo and over 0.5 million of them actively engaged with the experience. With strong traction on discovery and engagement with new customers, the focus has moved to monetization with them. One example is the rollout of a paywall for a full website immediately after Airo has built a Coming Soon page. This rollout followed a limited controlled experiment in which Websites + Marketing conversions improved 12%. Early data also shows that Airo leads to better product retention, which we will begin to understand more fully as these cohorts enter their renewal periods in the coming quarters. In parallel, we are building the engine to connect Airo with our existing base of 21 million customers. Our approach here is a different go-to-market motion, but the goal is the same: discovery then engagement and then monetization. As we shared at our Investor Day, monetization of our base with Airo represents one of the larger future opportunities for GoDaddy. We are also investing more in GABI, our internal AI-powered guide assist bot, which can now communicate in over 60 languages. Now rolled out globally, GABI is helping our guys work and serve customers more efficiently. While our investments in Airo and GABI are about the future, 2024 growth continues to be driven by our key initiatives, pricing and bundling, seamless experience, and commerce. Pricing and bundling continued to drive growth, led by productivity and was a significant contributor to the growth in applications and commerce bookings. We have started to apply our platform data, machine learning, and experimentation capabilities to the next set of product bundles as we look at opportunities for next year and beyond. Our seamless experience initiative over performed versus our expectations as we remove friction in both purchase and renewal paths across multiple products. At our scale small improvements in conversion and renewal rates, through better user experience, and robust technology provide measurable financial results. In our continued effort to take weight away from our customers, we expanded the use of AI-generated content. For example in Managed WordPress, we have optimized templates and enhanced models to generate content for multiple pages making it easier for our customers, to build and publish websites. On commerce, we are delivering on our 2024 target of driving higher-margin subscription revenue, with the recent launch of two new SaaS plants Point-Of-Sale Plus and Invoicing Plus. These plans offer premium features and discounted transaction fees to merchants. They drive value for our customers, by offering tools that simplify their operations, including real-time inventory management, online ordering, and customizable branded templates for invoices and e-mails. Annualized GPV also continued to grow at a fast pace, with the primary driver again being conversion within our existing base of customers. In closing, we continue to deliver on our key initiatives, unlocking new avenues of growth, and value creation for the long term. The GoDaddy team shares an unwavering determination to fearlessly push boundaries and prioritize, continuously experiment meticulously track results and aim for improvement each day. I am thrilled with the speed of execution as we continue striving to exceed customer expectations propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. We are pleased to announce our strong Q2 results, which demonstrate our commitment to execution and continued progress towards our North Star of maximizing free cash flow over the long term. Our North Star continues to be bolstered by two key pillars: sustained double-digit revenue growth in our Applications and Commerce segment increasing 15% in the second quarter and further expansion of our normalized EBITDA margin to 29%. We continued to build on our strong track record here delivering free cash flow of $323 million in the quarter. We also continued to implement our disciplined capital allocation strategy focusing on share buybacks and reducing our fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter to 145 million. We remain laser-focused on providing value for our customers by delivering seamless experiences that are easy to use driving better attached conversion and retention. At the same time, we continue to refine our operations to deliver profitable growth, while investing in exciting initiatives such as Airo which will provide benefits for years to come. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis exceeding the high end of our guided range for the quarter. ARPU grew 6% to $210 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our customer count declined slightly to $20.9 million, reflecting the expected headwinds from our proactive divestiture and migration efforts that also impacted revenue by approximately 100 basis points. Meanwhile, our customer retention rate is an impressive 85% and over 50% of GoDaddy's customers have two or more products with us. For our high-margin Applications and Commerce segment, we drove 24% growth in bookings and 15% growth in revenue to $406 million, delivering at the high end of our guided range. Growth in revenue and bookings was largely due to the continued strong performance of our growth initiatives, across all major Applications and Commerce product offerings particularly our productivity solutions. The segment EBITDA margin improved to 44%. In addition, ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 14% to $1.5 billion. Our core platform segment delivered bookings growth of 4% and revenue growth of 3% to $719 million in line, with our guided range. Core platform's performance this quarter reflected continued strength in both primary domains up 7% and aftermarket up 10%, partially offset by hosting divestitures. Segment EBITDA margin for core platform grew to 31%. Lastly, ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, up 2%. One quick update on domains under management. This quarter, in connection with the work related to our brand migration efforts, we determined that domains under management were overstated at the end of Q4 2023 by approximately 1.4 million domains, primarily related to European TLDs. Following correction of this disclosure, coupled with the impact from the divestiture completed at the end of Q1, domains under management as of June 30 were approximately 82.1 million domains. While we understand this metric may be closely followed, this is not a key operating or financial metric and it does not impact our forecast or progress towards our North Star. Moving to profitability. Normalized EBITDA grew 25% to $332 million and delivered an expanded margin of 29%, up over 400 basis points and exceeding our guide. On bookings, we delivered 11% growth in the second quarter on a reported and constant currency basis, achieving $1.3 billion. As a reminder, bookings primarily represent the cash collected during the period. Subscription bookings grew over three points ahead of subscription revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 30% to $369 million and free cash flow grew 35% to $323 million. Capital expenditures were down 52% from data center divestitures. Through July 30, we repurchased 4.1 million shares year-to-date, totaling $521 million. Cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations totaled $3.1 billion and 38.3 million shares. We have $915 million remaining under our current authorization. We have reduced gross shares outstanding since January 2022 by 23%, ahead of our three-year targeted reduction of 20%. We had 145 million fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As we have shared previously, we plan to be in the market every quarter subject to market conditions and other factors with a minimum offset to share-based compensation dilution. On our balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $445 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt was $3.4 billion representing net leverage of 2.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. Shifting to our outlook. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect the full year's revenue to be between $4.525 billion and $4.565 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We are targeting Q3 total revenue in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion also representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint of our range. We are also raising our expectations for Application and Commerce to deliver mid-teens growth for Q3 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver low single-digit growth in the third quarter and full year. With our proven track record of margin expansion we are committed to maintaining our operational discipline to drive further leverage in our model. We expect normalized EBITDA margin for Q3 to be approximately 29%. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver a 31% normalized EBITDA margin in Q4 and approximately 29% for the full year. Given our nearly 1:1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio, we are also raising our unlevered free cash flow target to $1.45 billion plus and free cash flow target to $1.3 billion plus. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach and we will continue to evaluate all opportunities for shareholder return according to our rigorous returns-based framework. We have made impressive progress driving profitable growth in line with our North Star in the first half of 2024 and we remain dedicated to the path we laid out at our Investor Day executing on our strategy with a combination of durable top line growth and expanded profitability. Our substantial cash generation, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation framework are important pillars of our investment thesis that create enduring value for our shareholders With that we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions.\nA - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Beck from Raymond James. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Beck: Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to start with A&C bookings rising from the low to mid-20s this quarter. Maybe help us think through and unpack the major drivers. You obviously cited bundling and productivity and how those could maybe change as we look ahead? And then related anything that we need to be cognizant of when we think about comps for A&C bookings in the second half and into 2025 as well?\nMark McCaffrey: Go ahead, Aman.\nAman Bhutani: It's one of those I want to take. Hey, Josh thanks for the question. Super excited about the momentum in A&C bookings 24% growth. And we're bringing to the table the full power the GoDaddy scale and data as part of a GoDaddy software platform. So whether it's pricing and bundling or our seamless experience improvements or commerce obviously they are all helping A&C growth. And we're bringing these capabilities to a broader set of our product suite. So as we look into the future, we continue to be very excited about being able to implement these capabilities across our entire products in both sort of scenarios with new customers and with existing customers as well. And I'll let Mark take some of the financial pieces.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And hi, Josh just to \u2013 we continue to see momentum across all the product groups within A&C. And for the first half of the year Q2 followed Q1 with double-digit growth in every area for bookings. When you asked about comps keep in mind Q2 compared to last year, it was an easier comp for us. So it did give us some benefit going forward as we reported this quarter. But it doesn't change the overall momentum of the bundling that's going on.\nJosh Beck: Super helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Airo, really helpful metrics. I think you mentioned one million discovered 0.5 million engaged. If we maybe double-click on that engaged group maybe what are some of the early standouts from adoption point of view? And when you think about the curve in the quarters ahead obviously, it hadn't been out that long. Is this the right cadence to think about in terms of number of customers ramping with that suite?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. The new customers engaging with Airo is happening at a tremendously fast pace. I couldn't be more excited about it. I think crossing the million milestone but more importantly the engagement with the product, right? We've talked about the three-step process of discovery, engagement then monetization. And for new customers we're really seeing good news there. As I talked about in the prepared remarks we're starting to add paywalls and monetizing a little bit on the new customers. But we're going to learn a lot more about that when those customers come up for renewal, right? And you asked about the areas where we see the most engagement. One of the areas where we're seeing the most engagement is actually with website. A lot more domain customers sort of discovering the fact that GoDaddy has not just website capability, but automated AI capabilities to just build a one-page website for them, which now they can actually customize a little bit too. So customers are really I think enjoying this, and our view is that that engagement is going to sort of lead to more monetization option in the future. And then of course, we have the very large base of existing customers to bring Airo too and that's a slightly different go-to-market motion, but ultimately, it's the same discovery engagement and then monetization and sort of our energy is going to be more and more focused on the existing as the new does better and better. In terms of overall time line, it actually mirrors very well. If you go back and look at our comments rollout first with you and then with existing. So we feel pretty good about it.\nJosh Beck: Great to hear. Thank you, Aman and Mark.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Josh.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. First one just on aftermarket solid double-digit growth there with -- it looks like about 20 points coming from ATV. Is the strength there becoming a bit more durable or broad-based in your view maybe extending to the larger piece of that business where it's like sub-$10000 domains? Or is it more about just a narrow few high-priced transaction skewing the trend upwards? And then what's baked in to guide for the back half of the year for aftermarket?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. Thanks, Trevor. We're seeing strength I would say overall in the volume related to aftermarket and we've talked about that coming into the year. And obviously, it's continued through Q2. We are seeing the return of larger transactions in the first half of the year. Hard to predict. We do believe that macro impacted related to those larger transactions, but they were definitely stronger in the first half of this year versus what we saw last year. As far as the guide going forward, we continue to call what we can see in front of us. It's hard to predict those large transactions, so we don't plan on them being there in any way shape or form. And they come in kind of hard and fast and close pretty quickly when they do come in. So again, we try to be prudent and just call based on the volume we're seeing at the lower end and we continue to think that overall, this platform will be a lower single-digit grower over time, although we may see volatility from quarter-to-quarter based on some of these larger transactions.\nTrevor Young: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, on the free cash flow guide, it looks like raising the unlevered free cash flow for the full year $150 million and regular free cash flow about $200 million. Can you distill the drivers of that change or rank order them? Is it the stronger flow-through of the top line or maybe stronger bookings or any onetime items to be mindful of?\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. I wouldn't say there's any one thing to call out. It is continued strong bookings continued normalized EBITDA and interest as well because we repriced some of our debt. So that's on the free cash flow part of it. But it's a combination of just better momentum across the board in translating into our free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thank you, Mark.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Jian Li from Evercore. Jian, please go ahead.\nJian Li: Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really nice quarter here. I want to circle back on the A&C bookings. Can you kind of -- is that booking strength primarily coming from the productivity pricing? Or is Airo conversion or Airo-driven conversion improvement a big part of that acceleration as well? And if you can talk a little bit about just the top of funnel that you're seeing going into A&C just given the current macro backdrop?\nAmanpal Bhutani: Yeah. Maybe we'll take a bit of that, Jian. Thanks for the question. On A&C, all the components of A&C as Mark said contributing to the growth. Of course, it's being led by productivity as we stated in our remarks, but GPV continues to grow very well. Our website business continued to grow very well as well. With respect to Airo, Airo even though we love the engagement and the discovery for new customers, it's still very small in terms of a contributor on the monetization side. So you're not really seeing much of Airo. And maybe I'll ask Mark to touch on that a bit more and come back to the last bit of your question.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And I think that's right. We are entering the monetization, but it's really early stage. It didn't have a meaningful impact on Q2. Don't have enough data points to really build in anything related to our guide or forecast related to it. But the early signs are very positive and we are starting to cross into seeing data around monetization today.\nAmanpal Bhutani: And then just on macro Q2 continued to be pretty steady in terms of demand coming in the door. And obviously, we have the global footprint, so it's a little bit different by region. But broadly, we would say it was a steady quarter in terms of macro.\nJian Li: Got it. And if I may ask a follow-up on the margins. So the EBITDA margin beat this quarter, but you're maintaining the full year guide. Is there some sort of timing in terms of expenses like shifting to the back half? Or if you continue to see upside in margins, would you expect to flow that through to the bottom line? Or any reinvestment that you're thinking as well?\nMark McCaffrey: Nothing to call out at this point. We're on a good pace. We're continuing to expand our margins as we said we would. There's nothing in particular we have to call out right now. Everything is on track and we are on track for the 31% exit rate that we had talked about at the beginning of the year.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\nElizabeth Porter: Hi. Thank you so much. I had a quick follow-up on GABI. I noticed that you talked about GABI is highlighting that it can serve customers more efficiently. How should we think about GABI? Is it more of a cost opportunity? Or is there a chance to turn customer service to actually more into a revenue centre as guide can drive better upsell and cross-sell?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. Thanks Elizabeth. Our core ethos around whether it's GABI or all of our capabilities in Care is that we always want to provide a superior experience at the same or lower cost, right? And in GABI we're super focused on making the guide slowly into a super guide. And whether it's the service side or support side or the sales side GABI is able to partner with the guide and allow them to explore things with the customer that otherwise it may be difficult because GABI has access to a lot more data given our scale. Of course on the sales side, Care continues to drive 9% of our bookings. We get a lot of calls and we've got 14 million contacts, 6,200 guides and GABI has access to all of that information to just make the guide better and better. So you'll see both. You'll see improved customer experience and you'll see more leverage on the cost.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. And then a follow-up on the A&C bookings. It sounds like momentum there can be pretty durable with multiple factors driving the growth. I'm hoping, if you could share any finer points on more specifically the pricing and bundling strategy about how broadly it's been rolled out whether from the product portfolio side or the customer base side just to understand the durability of this growth driver. Is there anything that you should roll out over the course of the year, or it could actually be a multiyear tail end?\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. As we talked a little bit about in the Investor Day, Elizabeth we see the pricing and bundling initiative as a multiyear initiative for us. So while productivity is leading the way this year and other products and bundles are a little bit behind it, we expect that over the next few years we'll be able to apply the same tools and capabilities across the GoDaddy suite. It's really about capturing all the data, all the customer insight into the GoDaddy software platform being able to drive and bring the customer the unique offering that works for them. And as we do that more and more we actually think it's going to become stronger over time. So yes we're looking forward to pricing in bundle and seamless experience trying to working together over multiple years.\nMark McCaffrey: Yeah. And just keep in mind too it's for new and renewals. So as renewals come up, you have the ability to sell into the existing customer base and that becomes a compounding factor. So more bundles hit more renewals, keep on going. That's why we think it's going to be a multiyear journey.\nAman Bhutani: Yeah. And I think the comps will play a little bit. We're coming into some other comps in the second half of the year. But overall the way we look at the return from these tools is they're continuing to set the pace for the company where overall bookings are pacing ahead by a point or two of revenue. And that sets us up very clearly for the next year in the future as well.\nElizabeth Porter: Great. Thank you so much and congrats on a strong quarter.\nAman Bhutani: Thanks, Elizabeth.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vik, please go ahead.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Hey, can you hear me?\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Hey, Vik.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask first on capital allocation. Mark, going back to the Investor Day you talked about kind of three main priorities in terms of the use of cash across repurchases, debt paydowns and acquisitions. I just wanted to clarify where do repurchases currently rank within those uses of capital today? And how do you do that in terms of priority or most attractive uses of cash flow right now? And then my second question, I wanted to put a finer point on the A&C bookings growth comments. That number has accelerated now a few quarters in a row. I realize you don't guide to a specific number on that. But as we look at the third quarter directionally, I mean should that continue to accelerate from the second quarter levels? Or should we expect it to moderate? And if you could talk through some of the puts and takes there that would be great. Thanks.\nMark McCaffrey: I'll start. I'm sure Aman will add on here. On capital allocation, the strategy remains the same. We're going to look at it from quarter-to-quarter. We've laid out our North Star and our North Star continues to be our ability to generate free cash flow. And obviously, look at that on a per share basis and continue to grow that at the CAGR we set out there. Now everything we look at has to be set against that backdrop. We still believe buying back our stock is a high ROI for us and we continue to look at that from quarter-to-quarter based on other factors that are going on in the market. So, no change there. Active discussion quarter-to-quarter looking at what's out there and looking at the different opportunities that can really drive that LTV we talked about at Investor Day. On the bookings and our pace there. Now just a couple of factors. One, we expect for the year to bookings to outpace revenue by about one to two points. And that's based on the momentum we're seeing in A&C and also some of the other areas. And we think that's going to set us up nicely for 2025. But we also will get more difficult comps as we go out throughout the year. So I want to say, the pace and the momentum are there, whether the percentages move a little bit based on tougher comps, we'll see as we go out throughout the year and into 2025. But the overall pacing is still strong and we're really happy with our ability to continue to get to that second and third products within our customer base today.\nVikram Kesavabhotla: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMark McCaffrey: Thanks Vik.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Arjun, please go ahead.\nWillow Miller: Hi. I'm Willow Miller on for Arjun Bhatia. Thanks for taking our questions. So shifting gears a bit and focusing more on commerce. In your prepared remarks, you called out the new Point-of-Sale and Invoicing plus SKUs offered discount to transaction-based to merchants. Are you only offering discounted transaction fees here? Or is there opportunity for volume-based advantaged pricing in other areas to attract more and larger customers to GoDaddy payments?\nAman Bhutani: Thanks Willow. As you'll probably remember, we have the best value for money in terms of payments pricing out there given the offering we bring to market. What these new SaaS plans do is they start to engage our customers into a deeper set of capabilities. So for example, with an Invoicing Plus plan customers are able to build a more custom invoice and put a logo on it or be able to e-mail that out in a very easy way. And that's us just expanding what the sort of tool set that our customers can use with GoDaddy in a very, very easy way. And on the pricing piece, we've had pricing being an advantage for us since we came out with commerce and payments. And we continue to use that advantage and we actually look at multiple avenues as we grow this business to continue to maintain that differentiator and create the value for the customer while also creating value for the company and the shareholder.\nWillow Miller: Great. Thanks for taking our questions.\nAman Bhutani: Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. First a clarifying one. Aman, you said improved conversion by 12%. I wanted to put that into context. Is that 12% improved conversion as a measure of 100% of users in the funnel? Or is that an improvement of 12% higher dollar value? If you could just clarify that point first?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. As I noted Clarke that I wanted to provide a data point of a controlled experiment. So that was an experiment in the path where a customer that buys a domain it's a coming soon page and we tried two or three different ways to provide a paywall to see which one engages the customer more. And it was the conversion from that free -- from that free coming soon page to a paid plan that increased by 12%. And that's typically on a unit basis. But the main point here is that by putting ourselves in the situation where customers are engaged with Airo, we are opening up all these new possibilities where this was a website example. But as you're aware, Airo today has nine cards that customers can engage with. And we are improving the way we engage customers across more and more of those capabilities that are just available to them when they buy a domain name. So as we get more of that engagement, we're going to continue to share with you how we are sort of stepping into the monetization. And I wouldn't over-index on any one of those pieces, it's more that how together all of those things lead to a completely different engaged customers, which we think in the long term is just very, very valuable to lifetime value.\nClarke Jeffries : Understood. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned the rollout to non-English speaking countries. What is the percent of the base that is English-speaking today? I mean we have that international versus domestic breakout, but I'd imagine there is a sizable contribution there from English-speaking countries.\nAman Bhutani : Yes. I don't think we've disclosed English speaking versus non, but our larger markets are English speaking. We have businesses in over -- we have customers in over 100 countries. So there is a sizable number of customers in many of those countries. There's great opportunity, because GoDaddy is still early, and we're able to bring domains customers there at our scale and with our capabilities. So we continue to be excited about what it is what we're bringing to the market. In terms of our actual English markets, our biggest markets are U.K., Canada and Australia. So those are our bigger businesses. So maybe you can do a bit of math if that's what you're looking for.\nClarke Jeffries : Thank you.\nAman Bhutani : Yes.\nChristie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead.\nYgal Arounian : Hey, good afternoon guys. Back to A&C looking to acceleration. We got this a lot last quarter in the translation to the top line guide in particular. At this point, we're nine points ahead on the A&C bookings acceleration or A&C bookings relative to the revenue. I understand we have some tougher comps, but how should we be thinking about how that translates to maybe why aren't we seeing it more? And on the comps, do you have us disclosed what the comps are pre-4Q of 2023? I may have missed it if you did, but could help kind of help people paint the picture to the revenue translation.\nMark McCaffrey : I'll take that first half, Ygal. Just a reminder, we have transaction revenue in subscription. And then within A&C, we have a mixture of both. And we saw a good performance today this quarter in commerce, which is a transactional revenue, but we're also seeing good performance in the other areas, which are subscription. So the timing of the revenue related to the bookings acceleration can be anywhere from immediately within the quarter to over a period of time and will start to contribute to revenue as we go out through further quarters. So we saw some contribution this quarter. We'll continue to see that as we get to the rest of this year. And obviously, in 2025, we'll have momentum going in there. But remember, it's a combination of both right? So we can hit in different periods depending on the nature of the bundle the transaction or the combination of the products they buy.\nAman Bhutani: And just Ygal on the bookings numbers for A&C at least, I believe you should have Q3 and Q4 but you can always take it offline.\nYgal Arounian : Okay. And then on the bundling. So, understanding productivity is the focus now and then there's more after is coming in the future. Maybe just a hit on what's next in the pipeline if you can? I guess, that's going to come over time. But we hear mostly about e-mail and security. Any more details around some of the key bundles that you expect to roll out I think would be really helpful. Thank you.\nAman Bhutani: Ultimately, we want to go across the board, right? Like the approach is really about the customer and not about the product, right? We're trying to create this value for the customer and their whole relationship with us. So, all the products are going to sort of see something over the next year or two. Not making any promises on it but some of the products in A&C that we're very excited about is for example the websites business. Just a couple of days completely unrelated to us tech-grade ARPU named Airo as the number one AI website builder for micro businesses. So we're definitely getting some momentum in that business. And with Airo, we think there's some great opportunity there. But that's not the only one. Our other products many of them are at significant scale and will lend themselves well to bundling in different ways.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. The advantage we have now with the consolidated technology stack is we have the ability to see what bundles really are attractive to our customers and we're starting to analyze that data and that starts to give us a path forward. Airo only helps that even further as we look at the behaviors and the engagement and allows us to start to position those bundles as to what value we can give to the customers.\nAman Bhutani: Yes. And there is a little bit of an order of operations Ygal where we have to hit certain renewal cycles to be able to see the customer behavior, right? So, it's not the thing that we can everything happen on in one quarter, one day. There is a progression of this program working over the next two, three years, getting to the real value for our customers.\nYgal Arounian: Great. Thank you.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Alex [indiscernible] from UBS. Alex, please go ahead.\nChris Kuntarich: Hi, you got Chris on the line. Just maybe going back to the attach comments in a couple of quarters now that you've said that over 50% of customers have two-plus products. Just curious if you could put a finer point on existing customers versus new customers? Are the new customers -- do they have a higher propensity to go to two, four, four plus type of attach versus the existing base?\nAman Bhutani: Yes. Chris we're very excited about the Airo offering, right? We're engaging customers with a lot more products right away. But the metric that Mark talks about is that's paid products. So, what we'll see happen is as we engage customers across these products when they come to those renewal cycles we expect to see sort of that number continuing to grow. But broadly our new customers adding more products has been a good trend for us.\nMark McCaffrey: And this has been something that's building over time. I think the metric we gave out at the end of the year was a customer new customer attach at rate 25% faster than they were three, four years ago. And that trend continues, right? Our customers are coming in with intent. They're engaging at different levels. And just to hit on the finer point that Aman said, we count that two-plus product when they pay, not when they engage. And that means it can come into a renewal it can come after a free trial. So, it takes time but they are definitely engaging at a higher level rate than we saw in the past.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Very helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on A&C incremental margins. It has been a couple of quarters where you're over 60% smaller [Technical Difficulty]. It really seems like you guys are sticking to a very cost control approach here. Any reason why this may be one-off here and not the right way to be thinking about it over the medium term?\nMark McCaffrey: There's nothing to call out on a one-off basis. This is just the three things we had talked about that would drive our profitability going forward. A&C growing which is our higher-margin business and being more of the pie over time will create a tailwind to our overall normalized EBITDA margin. As we start to tap into global talent pool, we'll use GABI more of that will create leverage within our P&L up and down. And then we continue our journey on operational simplification. We're trying to make sure we're fit for purpose going forward that we're agile and we continue to have that ability to not only invest in the business and invest in new technology, but have an efficient back-office operations. So, those three pillars still remain intact. And what we're seeing now is the A&C bookings and growth really becoming that tailwind that we had talked about coming into the year.\nChris Kuntarich: Thanks Mark.\nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead. Hey Naved, you're muted.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thanks. Can you hear me now?\nChristie Masoner: We can.\nNaved Khan: So apologies if somebody already asked this. I jumped on a little late. But a question I have is on your 3Q guidance specifically on the EBITDA guide. Why are you guiding to a compression in margins quarter-on-quarter? And also given that A&C continues to be the bigger piece of the business and that's the higher-margin business. So just kind of unpack that for me? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark McCaffrey: Yes. I think we're happy on -- with our margin expansion through the year. We continue to look at opportunities and look at product mix and how the momentum is moving. We overperformed in Q2 on our margin. We believe that will continue into Q3 at the same levels. And obviously, we talked about our Q4 exit rate will remain at the 31% keeping us at 29% for the year. Because our bookings are doing well and obviously, we talked about our raise in our guidance related to revenue, a lot of that percentage falls to the bottom line on an absolute dollar and allows us to feel good about raising our free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow guidance as well.\nNaved Khan: Got it. And then Aman, on your comments about now having like nine cards and Airo I think you started with maybe 5 or 6, if I remember correctly. Have you seen an improvement in conversion every time you add a card and then optimize the experience around that? Just give us some color around these launches and what the effect is on conversions on attach rates?\nAman Bhutani: Now they're picking on a really interesting thing where as we introduce more, we've got to be very careful to keep the experience simple for our customers. So actually there are a number of experiments that continue to evolve what the cards look like to get higher engagement with the customers. There's all sorts of different things from cards disappearing to changing the order to growing out to saying it's done. The teams are trying lots and lots of different combinations. And frankly there is more we want to include in Airo. And only when we make this simpler can we add the new things. So yes, that's a constant area of focus for us, but it's also the beauty of our scale, right? We have a breadth of products that we can bring to our customers. That's a lot of value we can pack in with a humble domain name. And if we can get the discovery and the engagement we can get the monetization. And at our scale we're doing lots and lots of experiments. We have teams that are well trained in understanding how to do this work well. And we're pretty excited about it. That's one of the reasons as Mark likes to say that Airo might be small today and it's not in our guide, but we are very excited about what it represents in the future for us.\nNaved Khan: So maybe just sort of to follow up on that. If I ask you, where are you on that journey with Airo if it's a 9-inning game? How would you kind of place yourself?\nAman Bhutani: We are in an early inning, Naved.\nMark McCaffrey: I was going to say we're in the first pitch, right? So there's a lot to go and a lot of exciting things going on there.\nNaved Khan: Excellent. Thank you, guys.\nChristie Masoner: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A. I'll turn the call back to Aman for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie. Thank you all for joining and a quick shot out to all GoDaddy employees for Airo being named the number one website builder just recently. And I think it sets a great tone for us at the company. It's always good to see somebody recognize our work. So thank you very much and we'll see you next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Bhutani",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our customers are a constant source of inspiration. One customer who has been with us for over 10 years runs a recruiting services company wrote to us recently and said, in today's business environment having partners that add real value is easier said than done. I'm happy to have GoDaddy on my extended business team. That is our goal to be the extended business team for millions of micro businesses. Our strategy is relentlessly focused on creating customer value and transforming it to shareholder value through better conversion, attach and retention. Our profitable growth model drives our North Star to maximize free cash flow over the long-term. The GoDaddy team is executing against this plan to drive innovation and operational efficiency leading to our strong Q2 results. This includes meaningful expansion of free cash flow delivering 35% growth. Additionally, Applications and Commerce bookings grew 24% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points. Our key growth and margin initiatives are driven by the innovation powered by the GoDaddy software platform. Our aspiration is to deliver seamlessly intuitive experiences that start to be magical and this is fueled by GoDaddy's unique scale and data. GoDaddy Airo, our AI-powered experience is one of the results of this aspiration. I am excited about Airo's ability to reinvent multiple interactions with our customers from domain search to insights on how they can improve their websites to growing their businesses. Airo is now rolled out to all new and existing customers across our English-speaking markets and it is poised for further expansion into over 90 countries in the coming months. Airo has already transformed the experience for our new customers. In Q2, we passed an exciting milestone. Over one million new customers have discovered Airo and over 0.5 million of them actively engaged with the experience. With strong traction on discovery and engagement with new customers, the focus has moved to monetization with them. One example is the rollout of a paywall for a full website immediately after Airo has built a Coming Soon page. This rollout followed a limited controlled experiment in which Websites + Marketing conversions improved 12%. Early data also shows that Airo leads to better product retention, which we will begin to understand more fully as these cohorts enter their renewal periods in the coming quarters. In parallel, we are building the engine to connect Airo with our existing base of 21 million customers. Our approach here is a different go-to-market motion, but the goal is the same: discovery then engagement and then monetization. As we shared at our Investor Day, monetization of our base with Airo represents one of the larger future opportunities for GoDaddy. We are also investing more in GABI, our internal AI-powered guide assist bot, which can now communicate in over 60 languages. Now rolled out globally, GABI is helping our guys work and serve customers more efficiently. While our investments in Airo and GABI are about the future, 2024 growth continues to be driven by our key initiatives, pricing and bundling, seamless experience, and commerce. Pricing and bundling continued to drive growth, led by productivity and was a significant contributor to the growth in applications and commerce bookings. We have started to apply our platform data, machine learning, and experimentation capabilities to the next set of product bundles as we look at opportunities for next year and beyond. Our seamless experience initiative over performed versus our expectations as we remove friction in both purchase and renewal paths across multiple products. At our scale small improvements in conversion and renewal rates, through better user experience, and robust technology provide measurable financial results. In our continued effort to take weight away from our customers, we expanded the use of AI-generated content. For example in Managed WordPress, we have optimized templates and enhanced models to generate content for multiple pages making it easier for our customers, to build and publish websites. On commerce, we are delivering on our 2024 target of driving higher-margin subscription revenue, with the recent launch of two new SaaS plants Point-Of-Sale Plus and Invoicing Plus. These plans offer premium features and discounted transaction fees to merchants. They drive value for our customers, by offering tools that simplify their operations, including real-time inventory management, online ordering, and customizable branded templates for invoices and e-mails. Annualized GPV also continued to grow at a fast pace, with the primary driver again being conversion within our existing base of customers. In closing, we continue to deliver on our key initiatives, unlocking new avenues of growth, and value creation for the long term. The GoDaddy team shares an unwavering determination to fearlessly push boundaries and prioritize, continuously experiment meticulously track results and aim for improvement each day. I am thrilled with the speed of execution as we continue striving to exceed customer expectations propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. It's one of those I want to take. Hey, Josh thanks for the question. Super excited about the momentum in A&C bookings 24% growth. And we're bringing to the table the full power the GoDaddy scale and data as part of a GoDaddy software platform. So whether it's pricing and bundling or our seamless experience improvements or commerce obviously they are all helping A&C growth. And we're bringing these capabilities to a broader set of our product suite. So as we look into the future, we continue to be very excited about being able to implement these capabilities across our entire products in both sort of scenarios with new customers and with existing customers as well. And I'll let Mark take some of the financial pieces. Yes. The new customers engaging with Airo is happening at a tremendously fast pace. I couldn't be more excited about it. I think crossing the million milestone but more importantly the engagement with the product, right? We've talked about the three-step process of discovery, engagement then monetization. And for new customers we're really seeing good news there. As I talked about in the prepared remarks we're starting to add paywalls and monetizing a little bit on the new customers. But we're going to learn a lot more about that when those customers come up for renewal, right? And you asked about the areas where we see the most engagement. One of the areas where we're seeing the most engagement is actually with website. A lot more domain customers sort of discovering the fact that GoDaddy has not just website capability, but automated AI capabilities to just build a one-page website for them, which now they can actually customize a little bit too. So customers are really I think enjoying this, and our view is that that engagement is going to sort of lead to more monetization option in the future. And then of course, we have the very large base of existing customers to bring Airo too and that's a slightly different go-to-market motion, but ultimately, it's the same discovery engagement and then monetization and sort of our energy is going to be more and more focused on the existing as the new does better and better. In terms of overall time line, it actually mirrors very well. If you go back and look at our comments rollout first with you and then with existing. So we feel pretty good about it. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks Elizabeth. Our core ethos around whether it's GABI or all of our capabilities in Care is that we always want to provide a superior experience at the same or lower cost, right? And in GABI we're super focused on making the guide slowly into a super guide. And whether it's the service side or support side or the sales side GABI is able to partner with the guide and allow them to explore things with the customer that otherwise it may be difficult because GABI has access to a lot more data given our scale. Of course on the sales side, Care continues to drive 9% of our bookings. We get a lot of calls and we've got 14 million contacts, 6,200 guides and GABI has access to all of that information to just make the guide better and better. So you'll see both. You'll see improved customer experience and you'll see more leverage on the cost. Yeah. As we talked a little bit about in the Investor Day, Elizabeth we see the pricing and bundling initiative as a multiyear initiative for us. So while productivity is leading the way this year and other products and bundles are a little bit behind it, we expect that over the next few years we'll be able to apply the same tools and capabilities across the GoDaddy suite. It's really about capturing all the data, all the customer insight into the GoDaddy software platform being able to drive and bring the customer the unique offering that works for them. And as we do that more and more we actually think it's going to become stronger over time. So yes we're looking forward to pricing in bundle and seamless experience trying to working together over multiple years. Yeah. And I think the comps will play a little bit. We're coming into some other comps in the second half of the year. But overall the way we look at the return from these tools is they're continuing to set the pace for the company where overall bookings are pacing ahead by a point or two of revenue. And that sets us up very clearly for the next year in the future as well. Thanks, Elizabeth. Thanks Willow. As you'll probably remember, we have the best value for money in terms of payments pricing out there given the offering we bring to market. What these new SaaS plans do is they start to engage our customers into a deeper set of capabilities. So for example, with an Invoicing Plus plan customers are able to build a more custom invoice and put a logo on it or be able to e-mail that out in a very easy way. And that's us just expanding what the sort of tool set that our customers can use with GoDaddy in a very, very easy way. And on the pricing piece, we've had pricing being an advantage for us since we came out with commerce and payments. And we continue to use that advantage and we actually look at multiple avenues as we grow this business to continue to maintain that differentiator and create the value for the customer while also creating value for the company and the shareholder. Thank you. Yes. As I noted Clarke that I wanted to provide a data point of a controlled experiment. So that was an experiment in the path where a customer that buys a domain it's a coming soon page and we tried two or three different ways to provide a paywall to see which one engages the customer more. And it was the conversion from that free -- from that free coming soon page to a paid plan that increased by 12%. And that's typically on a unit basis. But the main point here is that by putting ourselves in the situation where customers are engaged with Airo, we are opening up all these new possibilities where this was a website example. But as you're aware, Airo today has nine cards that customers can engage with. And we are improving the way we engage customers across more and more of those capabilities that are just available to them when they buy a domain name. So as we get more of that engagement, we're going to continue to share with you how we are sort of stepping into the monetization. And I wouldn't over-index on any one of those pieces, it's more that how together all of those things lead to a completely different engaged customers, which we think in the long term is just very, very valuable to lifetime value. Yes. I don't think we've disclosed English speaking versus non, but our larger markets are English speaking. We have businesses in over -- we have customers in over 100 countries. So there is a sizable number of customers in many of those countries. There's great opportunity, because GoDaddy is still early, and we're able to bring domains customers there at our scale and with our capabilities. So we continue to be excited about what it is what we're bringing to the market. In terms of our actual English markets, our biggest markets are U.K., Canada and Australia. So those are our bigger businesses. So maybe you can do a bit of math if that's what you're looking for. Yes. And just Ygal on the bookings numbers for A&C at least, I believe you should have Q3 and Q4 but you can always take it offline. Ultimately, we want to go across the board, right? Like the approach is really about the customer and not about the product, right? We're trying to create this value for the customer and their whole relationship with us.

And with Airo, we think there's some great opportunity there. But that's not the only one. Our other products many of them are at significant scale and will lend themselves well to bundling in different ways. Yes. And there is a little bit of an order of operations Ygal where we have to hit certain renewal cycles to be able to see the customer behavior, right? So, it's not the thing that we can everything happen on in one quarter, one day. There is a progression of this program working over the next two, three years, getting to the real value for our customers. Yes. Chris we're very excited about the Airo offering, right? We're engaging customers with a lot more products right away. But the metric that Mark talks about is that's paid products. So, what we'll see happen is as we engage customers across these products when they come to those renewal cycles we expect to see sort of that number continuing to grow. But broadly our new customers adding more products has been a good trend for us.

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. We are pleased to announce our strong Q2 results, which demonstrate our commitment to execution and continued progress towards our North Star of maximizing free cash flow over the long term. Our North Star continues to be bolstered by two key pillars: sustained double-digit revenue growth in our Applications and Commerce segment increasing 15% in the second quarter and further expansion of our normalized EBITDA margin to 29%. We continued to build on our strong track record here delivering free cash flow of $323 million in the quarter. We also continued to implement our disciplined capital allocation strategy focusing on share buybacks and reducing our fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter to 145 million. We remain laser-focused on providing value for our customers by delivering seamless experiences that are easy to use driving better attached conversion and retention. At the same time, we continue to refine our operations to deliver profitable growth, while investing in exciting initiatives such as Airo which will provide benefits for years to come. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis exceeding the high end of our guided range for the quarter. ARPU grew 6% to $210 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our customer count declined slightly to $20.9 million, reflecting the expected headwinds from our proactive divestiture and migration efforts that also impacted revenue by approximately 100 basis points. Meanwhile, our customer retention rate is an impressive 85% and over 50% of GoDaddy's customers have two or more products with us. For our high-margin Applications and Commerce segment, we drove 24% growth in bookings and 15% growth in revenue to $406 million, delivering at the high end of our guided range. Growth in revenue and bookings was largely due to the continued strong performance of our growth initiatives, across all major Applications and Commerce product offerings particularly our productivity solutions. The segment EBITDA margin improved to 44%. In addition, ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 14% to $1.5 billion. Our core platform segment delivered bookings growth of 4% and revenue growth of 3% to $719 million in line, with our guided range. Core platform's performance this quarter reflected continued strength in both primary domains up 7% and aftermarket up 10%, partially offset by hosting divestitures. Segment EBITDA margin for core platform grew to 31%. Lastly, ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, up 2%. One quick update on domains under management. This quarter, in connection with the work related to our brand migration efforts, we determined that domains under management were overstated at the end of Q4 2023 by approximately 1.4 million domains, primarily related to European TLDs. Following correction of this disclosure, coupled with the impact from the divestiture completed at the end of Q1, domains under management as of June 30 were approximately 82.1 million domains. While we understand this metric may be closely followed, this is not a key operating or financial metric and it does not impact our forecast or progress towards our North Star. Moving to profitability. Normalized EBITDA grew 25% to $332 million and delivered an expanded margin of 29%, up over 400 basis points and exceeding our guide. On bookings, we delivered 11% growth in the second quarter on a reported and constant currency basis, achieving $1.3 billion. As a reminder, bookings primarily represent the cash collected during the period. Subscription bookings grew over three points ahead of subscription revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 30% to $369 million and free cash flow grew 35% to $323 million. Capital expenditures were down 52% from data center divestitures. Through July 30, we repurchased 4.1 million shares year-to-date, totaling $521 million. Cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations totaled $3.1 billion and 38.3 million shares. We have $915 million remaining under our current authorization. We have reduced gross shares outstanding since January 2022 by 23%, ahead of our three-year targeted reduction of 20%. We had 145 million fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As we have shared previously, we plan to be in the market every quarter subject to market conditions and other factors with a minimum offset to share-based compensation dilution. On our balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $445 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt was $3.4 billion representing net leverage of 2.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. Shifting to our outlook. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect the full year's revenue to be between $4.525 billion and $4.565 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We are targeting Q3 total revenue in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion also representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint of our range. We are also raising our expectations for Application and Commerce to deliver mid-teens growth for Q3 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver low single-digit growth in the third quarter and full year. With our proven track record of margin expansion we are committed to maintaining our operational discipline to drive further leverage in our model. We expect normalized EBITDA margin for Q3 to be approximately 29%. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver a 31% normalized EBITDA margin in Q4 and approximately 29% for the full year. Given our nearly 1:1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio, we are also raising our unlevered free cash flow target to $1.45 billion plus and free cash flow target to $1.3 billion plus. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach and we will continue to evaluate all opportunities for shareholder return according to our rigorous returns-based framework. We have made impressive progress driving profitable growth in line with our North Star in the first half of 2024 and we remain dedicated to the path we laid out at our Investor Day executing on our strategy with a combination of durable top line growth and expanded profitability. Our substantial cash generation, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation framework are important pillars of our investment thesis that create enduring value for our shareholders With that we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. Go ahead, Aman. Yes. And hi, Josh just to \u2013 we continue to see momentum across all the product groups within A&C. And for the first half of the year Q2 followed Q1 with double-digit growth in every area for bookings. When you asked about comps keep in mind Q2 compared to last year, it was an easier comp for us. So it did give us some benefit going forward as we reported this quarter. But it doesn't change the overall momentum of the bundling that's going on. Thanks, Josh. Yeah. Thanks, Trevor. We're seeing strength I would say overall in the volume related to aftermarket and we've talked about that coming into the year. And obviously, it's continued through Q2. We are seeing the return of larger transactions in the first half of the year. Hard to predict. We do believe that macro impacted related to those larger transactions, but they were definitely stronger in the first half of this year versus what we saw last year. As far as the guide going forward, we continue to call what we can see in front of us. It's hard to predict those large transactions, so we don't plan on them being there in any way shape or form. And they come in kind of hard and fast and close pretty quickly when they do come in. So again, we try to be prudent and just call based on the volume we're seeing at the lower end and we continue to think that overall, this platform will be a lower single-digit grower over time, although we may see volatility from quarter-to-quarter based on some of these larger transactions. Yeah. I wouldn't say there's any one thing to call out. It is continued strong bookings continued normalized EBITDA and interest as well because we repriced some of our debt. So that's on the free cash flow part of it. But it's a combination of just better momentum across the board in translating into our free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow. Yeah. And I think that's right. We are entering the monetization, but it's really early stage. It didn't have a meaningful impact on Q2. Don't have enough data points to really build in anything related to our guide or forecast related to it. But the early signs are very positive and we are starting to cross into seeing data around monetization today. Nothing to call out at this point. We're on a good pace. We're continuing to expand our margins as we said we would. There's nothing in particular we have to call out right now. Everything is on track and we are on track for the 31% exit rate that we had talked about at the beginning of the year. Yeah. And just keep in mind too it's for new and renewals. So as renewals come up, you have the ability to sell into the existing customer base and that becomes a compounding factor. So more bundles hit more renewals, keep on going. That's why we think it's going to be a multiyear journey. Yes. Hey, Vik. I'll start. I'm sure Aman will add on here. On capital allocation, the strategy remains the same. We're going to look at it from quarter-to-quarter. We've laid out our North Star and our North Star continues to be our ability to generate free cash flow. And obviously, look at that on a per share basis and continue to grow that at the CAGR we set out there. Now everything we look at has to be set against that backdrop. We still believe buying back our stock is a high ROI for us and we continue to look at that from quarter-to-quarter based on other factors that are going on in the market. So, no change there. Active discussion quarter-to-quarter looking at what's out there and looking at the different opportunities that can really drive that LTV we talked about at Investor Day. On the bookings and our pace there. Now just a couple of factors. One, we expect for the year to bookings to outpace revenue by about one to two points. And that's based on the momentum we're seeing in A&C and also some of the other areas. And we think that's going to set us up nicely for 2025. But we also will get more difficult comps as we go out throughout the year. So I want to say, the pace and the momentum are there, whether the percentages move a little bit based on tougher comps, we'll see as we go out throughout the year and into 2025. But the overall pacing is still strong and we're really happy with our ability to continue to get to that second and third products within our customer base today. Thanks Vik. I'll take that first half, Ygal. Just a reminder, we have transaction revenue in subscription. And then within A&C, we have a mixture of both. And we saw a good performance today this quarter in commerce, which is a transactional revenue, but we're also seeing good performance in the other areas, which are subscription. So the timing of the revenue related to the bookings acceleration can be anywhere from immediately within the quarter to over a period of time and will start to contribute to revenue as we go out through further quarters. So we saw some contribution this quarter. We'll continue to see that as we get to the rest of this year. And obviously, in 2025, we'll have momentum going in there. But remember, it's a combination of both right? So we can hit in different periods depending on the nature of the bundle the transaction or the combination of the products they buy. Yes. The advantage we have now with the consolidated technology stack is we have the ability to see what bundles really are attractive to our customers and we're starting to analyze that data and that starts to give us a path forward. Airo only helps that even further as we look at the behaviors and the engagement and allows us to start to position those bundles as to what value we can give to the customers. And this has been something that's building over time. I think the metric we gave out at the end of the year was a customer new customer attach at rate 25% faster than they were three, four years ago. And that trend continues, right? Our customers are coming in with intent. They're engaging at different levels. And just to hit on the finer point that Aman said, we count that two-plus product when they pay, not when they engage. And that means it can come into a renewal it can come after a free trial. So, it takes time but they are definitely engaging at a higher level rate than we saw in the past. There's nothing to call out on a one-off basis. This is just the three things we had talked about that would drive our profitability going forward. A&C growing which is our higher-margin business and being more of the pie over time will create a tailwind to our overall normalized EBITDA margin. As we start to tap into global talent pool, we'll use GABI more of that will create leverage within our P&L up and down. And then we continue our journey on operational simplification. We're trying to make sure we're fit for purpose going forward that we're agile and we continue to have that ability to not only invest in the business and invest in new technology, but have an efficient back-office operations. So, those three pillars still remain intact. And what we're seeing now is the A&C bookings and growth really becoming that tailwind that we had talked about coming into the year. Yes. I think we're happy on -- with our margin expansion through the year. We continue to look at opportunities and look at product mix and how the momentum is moving. We overperformed in Q2 on our margin. We believe that will continue into Q3 at the same levels. And obviously, we talked about our Q4 exit rate will remain at the 31% keeping us at 29% for the year. Because our bookings are doing well and obviously, we talked about our raise in our guidance related to revenue, a lot of that percentage falls to the bottom line on an absolute dollar and allows us to feel good about raising our free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow guidance as well. I was going to say we're in the first pitch, right? So there's a lot to go and a lot of exciting things going on there."

I'm Christie Masoner, Vice President of Investor Relations -- and with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] \n On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating and business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted on our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. \n Growth rates represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. \n Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 2, 2024. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events.\n With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy relentlessly focuses on creating customer value and successfully transitions it to shareholder value. This is the driving force behind our profitable growth model, that maximizes free cash flow. I'm excited by the innovative experiences we are delivering for our customers, the dedication and velocity of execution of our teams and the trajectory those have created for our company. \n At our Investor Day, we shared our updated 3-year strategic framework and financial targets. As our Q1 results showcase, we are off to a strong start in 2024. In service of our North Star, we continue to expand our free cash flow meaningfully delivering 26% free cash flow growth year-over-year. The pillars behind our North Star are accelerating growth in our applications and commerce segment and disciplined margin expansion. \n In Q1, applications and commerce bookings accelerated to 22% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded 400 basis points. At our Investor Day, we also shared our progress on the GoDaddy software platform. The GoDaddy software platform helped create game-changing customer experiences like GoDaddy Airo. It combines the power of our infrastructure, large-scale data, AI and machine learning, experimentation and monetization to power our growth and margin drivers. \n Today, I wanted to provide an update on 4 of the key initiatives we shared previously. First, enhancing our pricing and bundling capabilities remains an important lever for GoDaddy. This quarter, we focused our pricing and bundling efforts on our productivity solutions which was a key contributor to the 22% bookings growth in applications and commerce segment. \n Our software platform has a vast amount of data and we leverage that data in more and more pricing and bundling experimentations. This gives us powerful insights on how and where to push forward as we continue to roll these learnings into additional products and bundles over time.\n Second, creating seamless experiences for our customers continues to be a key priority. We are removing friction out of every piece of the entrepreneurs' wheel, saving our customers' time and money. We continuously work on simplification and performance improvements that deliver value for our customers. \n Examples from this quarter include simplifying the editor in Websites + Marketing, making it easier for customers to discover new capabilities, reducing provisioning time for the online store to a few seconds and using AI to streamline manage WordPress website creation to just a few clicks. Simplified, smart, fast experiences come across as magical to our customers and customer delight creates customer value, increasing willingness to pay.\n Third, on commerce, I am pleased to share that annualized GPV continued to grow at a fast pace, surpassing the $2 billion milestone. The primary driver continues to be conversion within our existing base of customers. In addition, this quarter, we launched GoDaddy Smart Terminal Flex, a hand held device that allows our customers to accept payments anywhere on the fly.\n Our commerce offering is growing and sets us up well for our 2024 focus on driving higher-margin subscription revenue through the sale of tailored omnicommerce  solutions to our customers. The significant value we are driving with our commerce offerings also introduces an opportunity for us to evolve our pricing structure within payments. Last week, we began rolling out phased transaction fee increases across our customer population, while still maintaining our status as the best value in payments.\n Fourth, we continue to be tremendously excited about the range of possibilities with GoDaddy Airo. As planned, we started rolling out GoDaddy Airo to our base in late March. Go Daddy Airo opens the door to many opportunities across discovery, engagement and monetization and represents an incremental opportunity as a powerful growth driver over the next couple of years. We have continued to rapidly iterate this experience, and I wanted to share a couple of examples. \n More customers are discovering GoDaddy Airo, and we have more for them. We launched a new payment  card to test engagement with payments. A card is a visual representation of a product that is automatically set up and configured by GoDaddy Airo on just a domain purchase. We see early indication that GoDaddy Airo does a better job of discovery and engagement with pay links than our normal methods. \n Another significant change in monetization is that we introduced a pay wall for websites built by GoDaddy Airo. We are actively testing different points at which this pay wall can be triggered and this is a new flow that we are excited to optimize. \n While all this data is early, we are also excited to see that websites built by GoDaddy Airo are performing well. More domain customers are opting in for a website when we offer them GoDaddy Airo. And key product metrics are either ahead or within our expectations. These metrics give us confidence that we are achieving our goal of a seamless, intuitive, magical experience for our customers. \n I also wanted to quickly share that GoDaddy Airo domain search is now on the home page for all desktop users globally. And we are starting to test opportunities to optimize the traditional search experience using these new capabilities. \n Last but not least, GABI our guide assist bot, is now rolled out across our entire care footprint and is handling escalations and questions from our guides. GABI also helps with providing call summaries and case notes, helping our guides be more efficient. Every month that goes by GABI becomes smarter. And over time, we can add use cases and drive further adoption.\n In closing, we continue to deliver on our key initiatives and unlock new avenues of growth and value creation for the long term. The GoDaddy team is a driven group and shares an unwavering determination to fearlessly push boundaries and prioritize, continuously experiment, meticulously track results and strive for improvement each day. I am thrilled with the speed of execution as we continue to strive to exceed customer expectations, propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. \n With that, here's Mark. \nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Aman. We are pleased to announce our strong Q1 results and continued track record of durable growth. We've demonstrated attractive progress toward our North Star, delivering strong free cash flow of $327 million, alongside continued execution of our capital allocation strategy, which reduced our fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter to 146 million.\n The key pillars underlying our North Star are the double-digit growth in our application and commerce segment revenue of 13%, coupled with disciplined normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 28%, which converts to free cash flow and an impressive 1:1 ratio. \n Through our seamless technology and comprehensive one-stop shop approach, we are building improved customer value. Our strategic focus is delivering results that drive better attach and conversion while maintaining impressive retention rates. Together, these efforts are building a foundation for enduring shareholder value. \n Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis, and exceeding the high end of our guided range on the strength of the pricing and bundling initiative as well as strong demand in our aftermarket. ARPU grew 5% to $206 on a trailing 12-month basis and our customer count remains stable despite the headwinds from our divestiture and migration efforts, also impacting revenue by approximately 100 basis points. \n Additionally, customers with 2 or more products remained above 50% and our customer retention rate remained at 85%. Double-clicking into the segments, our higher-margin Applications & Commerce segment delivered $383 million in revenue, growing 13%, in line with our guided range. The drivers of this performance included strength in our bundling and pricing initiative across all major product offering, including productivity solutions, website building products and commerce.\n Additionally, annualized GPV for GoDaddy payments grew to $2 billion for the first time. Segment EBITDA margin was 42%, up over 300 basis points. Lastly, ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 13% to $1.5 billion. Core platform revenue totaled $725 million, growing 4% which exceeded our guide on strength in domains, up 7% and aftermarket, up 12%. \n Our growth was driven by strong demand for domains in the primary and secondary market, increased pricing in the primary market and a higher average transaction value in the secondary market. This was partially offset by a decrease in hosting our divestitures. Segment EBITDA margin for core platform grew to 30%, up nearly 300 basis points. Lastly, ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, up 3%. Consolidated normalized EBITDA grew 25% to $313 million, while delivering an expanded margin of 28%, up 400 basis points, exceeding our guide. Margin expansion was driven by continued leverage gains within all expense line items on the P&L. \n Moving on to bookings. In Q1, we achieved 9% growth on our reported and constant currency basis, reaching $1.3 billion. As a reminder, bookings primarily represent the cash collected during the period. Applications in commerce bookings grew 22% from improvements in pricing and bundling for productivity solutions, website building products and commerce. Core platform bookings increased 3% on the performance of domains in aftermarket on strong demand for domains in the primary and secondary market, offset by headwinds in hosting.\n Subscription bookings grew 2 points ahead of subscription revenue. The impressive momentum in our bookings, coupled with our commitment to profitable growth and ability to convert normalized EBITDA to free cash flow at a ratio of 1:1 powers our substantial cash generation. \n Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 18% to $359 million and free cash flow grew 26% to $327 million. We are committed to effectively managing our balance sheet and the proactive measures we took to reprice our long-term debt resulted in a 30% favorable change in cash interest payments compared to last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were also down 81% from data center divestitures. \n Through April 30, we repurchased 2.8 million shares year-to-date, totaling $346 million. This brings the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations to $2.9 billion and 37 million shares, reducing gross shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations by 22%, ahead of our 3-year targeted reduction of 20%. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were 146 million shares. \n Our successful share repurchase program continues to drive impressive ROI for our free cash flow deployment. We have $1.1 billion remaining under our current authorization, and we plan to be in the market every quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors, with a minimum offset to share-based compensation dilution. \n Moving to the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $664 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt was $3.2 billion, representing net leverage of 2.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. \n Shifting to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we are raising the lower end of the range for our full year revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be between $4.5 billion and $4.56 billion, representing growth of 6.5% at the midpoint. Additionally, we are targeting Q2 total revenue in the range of $1.1 million to $1.12 billion, representing growth of 6% at the midpoint of our range. We expect applications in commerce to deliver low to mid-teens growth for Q2 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver low single-digit growth in the second quarter and the full year. \n We are proud of our track record of margin expansion, and we will continue to maintain operational discipline to drive further leverage in our model. We expect normalized EBITDA for Q2 to be approximately 28%. Additionally, we remain on track to meet 31% normalized EBITDA margin in Q4. Full year normalized EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We are on track for our full year unlevered free cash flow and free cash flow targets of $1.4 billion plus and $1.2 billion plus, respectively. \n On capital allocation, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for shareholder return, subjecting them to our published rigorous returns-based framework to ensure we achieve the optimal mix for cash flow deployment. The entire GoDaddy team remains committed to delivering against the 3-year framework we shared at Investor Day with 6% to 8% annual top-line growth fueled by our Applications & Commerce segment, accelerating normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 33% by 2026 and generation of $4.5 billion plus in cumulative free cash flow.\n Our profitable growth and 1:1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow ratio, coupled with our disciplined capital allocation framework, creates significant value for our shareholders. While I am pleased with our progress towards our North Star, we are far from done, and I continue to have strong confidence in our strategy and execution. \n With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open the call for questions. \nChristie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. \nYgal Arounian: Maybe I'm just going to start on the strong bookings growth. And I know you talked about pricing particularly in A&C. But 22% booking growth there, 1Q. Almost 10% overall coming off of the strong booking number in 4Q as well. Typically, we think of that type of acceleration as really meaningful in driving revenue growth acceleration in the back half, but we didn't see that in your guidance. So how should we be thinking about how that translates and what all that means as we kind of look through to the whole year here? \nMark McCaffrey: Ygal, thanks for the question. We couldn't be more excited about the bookings growth in A&C and the momentum we have coming out of Q1 and the impact on the rest of the year, no doubt about it. As we get into the bundling, just a reminder, revenue is recognized from the bookings and it can be on different periods of time. So that momentum will continue. But given the size of our business, obviously, it takes a while to show up into the revenue growth numbers as we go on, couldn't be more excited about it, though.\n Just a reminder too, we do have a few headwinds out there relating to the dispositions. Those will peak in Q2. We expect them to abate throughout the year. But again, we still have a few of those headwinds out there. So again, we have great momentum, but we're trying to balance some of the actions that we took. \n So when you put that all together, I would say we're comfortable that lowering the low end of the guide was the appropriate thing to do, and we'll continue to keep everyone updated as we go throughout the rest of the year. But yes, we are pretty excited about some of the pricing and bundling initiatives and the impact they had on Q1 bookings. \nYgal Arounian: Okay. Great. Really helpful. And maybe on Airo, I know you gave some qualitative comments here, but any more you could share? You're rolling out internationally, where we've got a couple of months under our belt here. You mentioned you're seeing kind of domain customers move to Airo, when they're offered it. Anything you're seeing, incremental uplift in conversion, ARPU growth on the -- whether it's applications account collectively or just Website + Marketing, anything else investors can kind of hang their hats on how well Airo is doing? Or what is sort of going to drive the conversion you've been expecting? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Thanks, Ygal. Super excited about Airo. It's the best vehicle we have built to carry products to our customers. We know it's doing very well with new customers. And as I've shared, we've started to roll it out to our base as well. Airo just does a fantastic job of getting our customers engaged. And the metrics that we shared around it, they continue to be about discovery, which means our customers finding that GoDaddy has all these products about engagement, where they start using those products or you can say, attach them and then monetization where they start to pay for those products.\n And we're very methodically moving through those 3 phases. What I can share today is that on discovery, we're seeing fantastic results there. Customers buy a domain, they see their cards, they engage with the cards, customers are starting to learn that GoDaddy has way more products for me, way more offerings for me. \n And I shared a little comment about pay links in the prepared remarks but I'll also share coming soon site, which is a one-page website that gets created with a domain, gets a great amount of engagement. Just regular website is getting more engagement with Airo than when we didn't have Airo. So these cards are really starting to take off in terms of discovery and engagement, which give us confidence that as we move towards monetization, we're going to have multiple levers at play. And we've started to build the pay walls and do stuff. And over the next couple of years, we think this will roll out very well and deliver results for years to come. \nChristie Masoner: Next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. \nMark Zgutowicz: Maybe just a follow-up on that impressive A&C bookings number. Curious how much you'd attribute to product attach versus pricing in terms of that acceleration? And on the pricing side, just curious how pervasive your AI or value-based pricing initiative is across your A&C base. Does it touch all A&C customers at this point? That's the first question. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Thanks, Mark. Our sort of value-based pricing, AI-based pricing and bundling initiatives have not gone across all A&C. It's starting to roll out across a lot. What you're seeing in the 22% application and then bookings growth is the combination of pricing and bundling, really touching our productivity and starting to hit our website business, too. So super excited about that. There is more to go there. So we're going to continue to invest in that area and go across not just AMC, but over time, go to every customers of GoDaddy and bringing them on to these new sort of pricing and bundling approach that we have. \nMark Zgutowicz: Okay. Got it. And then I think you had mentioned that Airo is leading to some increasing website attach rate for your domain customers. I was just hoping you might be able to expand on that a bit, maybe just some KPIs that you're seeing, maybe conversion rate, but that seems to be maybe awakening a sleeping giant there for some time. Just kind of trying to get a sense of how significant that could be. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes, it's still early days, Mark, with our new customers. Obviously, that's a smaller stream of customers. With our new customers, we do see significant take rates for like a coming-soon website or actual website attach. We see that engagement -- sort of discovery and engagement and are doing really well. But the large, large opportunity, of course, is in our base. And we're literally not even 5, 6 weeks from putting Airo into our base. So it's going to take a little time, given the large customer base and our approach of going into it in a systematic manner. \n We have lots of learnings from taking productivity into our base, taking commerce into our base. We're taking that same methodical approach in going into the base. It's going to take a little bit more time for us to gather data to be able to sort of share it publicly to say this is what we see. But I can tell you, we're super excited about it. And if the new customer engagement is any indicator of the base, there will be years, many, many years, we'll be talking about this. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. \nKenneth Wong: Great. I wanted to maybe kind of pick your brain in terms of the rationale behind kind of changing payment pricing structure and then how you think about how that could impact the near-term dynamics and if you're sensing any kind of customer pushback there. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. We're very methodical, Ken, on our approach to pricing. And like we've talked about, everything is tested. So we have tests out there, as we said, it's on a phased basis. And we're really trying to create multiple offerings for our customers. And while we maintain our position in the industry for being the best value for money. It allows us to have differentiated products within our portfolio and reach more customers. \n So this is something you'll see more of, and we'll talk about it over the next few quarters. But, really, what it opens up -- us up for a broader commerce solution with differentiated pricing across different bundles. And we're trying to set things up for the same sort of mindset of pricing and bundling activity together for commerce as we are bringing [ available ] of products. \nKenneth Wong: Got it. And then maybe, Mark, just in terms of -- just remind us kind of what we should be thinking in terms of the lag between kind of revenue and bookings. And specifically, on A&C, where there's obviously a much larger delta from kind of the teens to the 20s, like how -- what -- just help us kind of think through what that convergence looks like. \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And I'll take it up a level, too. When we think about the bookings to revenue, we have multiple different products, multiple different terms, the revenue can be -- come out in many different ways. The way we look at it is we think bookings is going to be 1 to 2 points ahead of revenue for 2024. And that'll give us a lot of momentum as we continue to see the results of the bundling and pricing initiative as well as the momentum we're seeing in things like aftermarket. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Just a quick add, Ken, that our general term in just around 12 months, a little over. So that can give you sort of the idea of how bookings will take about 12 months, get distributed about over 12 months for revenue. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from Raymond James. \nJosh Beck: Yes, I just wanted to ask about some of the success with the pay links. It sounds like it's driven an uplift on discovery and engagement maybe versus what you had in place prior. So are there certain channels, whether it's tech or social where it's doing a better job of driving engagement. Just, would like to understand a little bit, just some more context behind that comment, if possible. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. The biggest sort of encouragement for our customers, the best vehicle we've put in place for pay link attach is being in Airo, right? And the way it happens is that when the customer buys the domain name, all these cards, all these capabilities get set up automatically. \n And we introduced pay link in a very similar way as we introduced the other capabilities. And what we found is we obviously had existing ways of helping our customers discover pay links, helping them engage with them and start to transact using pay links. But Airo sort of brought it together in a very simple manner. \n It was right there in front of customers and we saw the customers engage with it at significantly higher rates than without Airo. So that's what's driving sort of the engagement with pay links. Overall, for GPV, we did hit the $2 billion annualized GPV milestone this last quarter. And the biggest part of that continues to be going into our base of customers and converting them to GoDaddy payments. \nJosh Beck: Okay. That's super helpful. And maybe just kind of a follow-on to that last point. When you look at the existing base and you think about the conversion opportunities, should we be looking at, really, when these customers come up for renewal with their existing payment provider, that's an opportunity for you. Is there maybe a chance to kind of put some type of firmer pressure on them to really kind of incentivize them to move over? Just help us kind of understand how you're helping promote that conversion. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. There are some customer events -- customer-side events, for example, like you said, a customer coming up on a renewal. That may create an opportunity. But what we really lead with is that we have a relationship with these customers, right? GoDaddy has 65-plus transactions in NPS and in Care. Our customers are used to having a great relationship with us. So when we engage them, number one, they're open to the idea of GoDaddy offering them GoDaddy Payments.\n The second pillar of what we approached them with is that we offer them the one-stop shop. They have other relationships with GoDaddy. We can introduce one bill, one partner to work with. We can make it easier, and that's attractive to our customers because a lot of them start by saying, \"Oh, I didn't even realize that you had payments.\" \"Oh, it's pretty great.\" \"Oh, I like the way this works.\" \"Oh, this works seamlessly with all my other stuff I do with GoDaddy.\" So that's a win for us too.\n And then you've got pricing that's the best value in the market today, which sort of comes in as a third pillar of that sales pitch. And what we continuously are finding is that, that works. That encourages our customers who have great relationships with us, who run micro businesses adopt GoDaddy Payments, and that's what's been driving our GPV growth. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. \nVikram Kesavabhotla: Hey, can you hear me? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Hey, Vik. \nVikram Kesavabhotla: My first question is for Aman. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that GABI has now been rolled out to the entire care team. Just curious what the early data points have been there in terms of the impact that's having on efficiency. I know at the Investor Day, you talked about the potential for that to reduce time and interactions for the team. Just curious what you're seeing so far there and what the early reception has been from the care team.\n And then my second question is for Mark. It looks like you exceeded the first quarter guidance on EBITDA margin. Just wondering if you could talk more about some of the drivers of the outperformance there. And how much of that was specific to the quarter versus factors that could ultimately benefit the balance of the year? And I'll leave it there. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Vikram, a quick word on GABI. I'm super excited for what Gabby offers us over the long term, right? Being able to bring the massive amount of data that only GoDaddy has, working with 21 million paying customers and many more over the years, using AI to bring it together and putting it on the fingertips of every guide in the company, that's a powerful combination, right? And where we are is the tool is rolled out. The guys are starting to use it. There is, of course, always a little bit of time for adoption and training for people learning how to use even a new tool that's GenAI powered.\n But super excited about it. I mentioned a couple of use cases that are already live with GABI, where GABI's able to do the summaries or just start to take on tasks that otherwise guides would have had to do sort of start to move up from guides doing that -- to automation and GABI taking care of that. So there's lots of use cases we have in mind. We have a fantastic roadmap over the next couple of years in front of us. And yes, pretty excited about it. \nMark McCaffrey: And Vik, on the normalized EBITDA margin, I would say, quarter-to-quarter, you may see some fluctuations depending on the timing of spend. Overall, if you look at Q1, we've always said accelerated A&C will be a tailwind to our ability to expand our margins over time. And with the pacing you saw in Q1, we saw some of the benefit of that. For the year, we're on track for the 31% to exit, and we feel good about that, and we're on track for the 29% for the entire year. And obviously, we've talked about our ability to expand that going out. And all those -- all that framework remains in place, and we continue to see the benefit of the ANC tailwind related to that. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Seaport. \nAaron Kessler: Maybe just first on any update just on macro, just what trends are you seeing there? And I know customers are flat kind of year-over-year. I assume there was maybe some disposition impact on that? If you can just talk on that? And then also the -- if you may, to that point, trends in gross adds that you're seeing along with that? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Thanks, Aaron. On the macro, I think the word we internally feel represents it best is a steadiness to the macro. And I think that's been a positive for us, right? We had and we talked about it in 2023, strong gross adds and customers coming -- continuing to come in at the top of the funnel. And of course, some divestitures and integrations as an offset to that for the company, which I look at that as a short-term gain. But good strong gross adds coming in.\n The steadiness in the macro, we believe, will continue to power that. And again, continuing to have a lot of firepower in terms of really efficient marketing at our disposal. Our marketing is getting better and better. It's driven with data and lots of opportunities for us to continue to explore to put more dollars at play and get really efficient returns on them. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Jian Li from Evercore. \nJian Li: So I want to kind of go back to Airo. First, maybe just to -- it sounds like Airo's still in the early days of monetization. Are you baking in any kind of contribution to revenue and/or any contribution to bookings for this quarter for that matter? So if you can kind of talk about the contribution here. And also, I think in the Investor Day, you sort of alluded to Airo being applicable broadly across DIY and Pro users. So I'm just wondering if there is any product features for Airo that you're building specifically for the pros or agency community? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Thanks, Jian. And I'll start with the first part, and Aman will probably answer the second part there. The way we're looking at Airo right now, we are in the discovery and the engagement phase. We haven't hit the monetization phase. We're very early on. We're looking at all the statistics. We're looking at the level of engagement around it, but nothing has been built into our bookings or revenue for that matter in our model today. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. And I think the way you might think about it, a lot of value is being created for customers with Airo because they're getting a bundling -- bundled experience that's seamless, that's connected. And some of that monetization opportunity we have talked about like Airo Premium and pay walls, but there's also a monetization opportunity that would happen at renewals, but that would be a year out from the time the customer bought the domain. So just, Jian, keep that in mind as well.\n On your question on Airo features for Pro, the feature that I'm personally very excited about is Airo Insights, which is the capability where Airo assess an existing website and give super actionable advice to Pros and how to improve that website. We have a version of that, that's going to be able to work for customers, too. But that product, from the first day, from the ground up, it was built for Pros. Its first implementation is with WordPress and it's a fantastic product. Like, we get great engagement from pros on it. Again, as with all Airo products, that is still at the discovery and engagement phase. We have not added monetization yet. But this year, we expect to test a number of monetized methods for Airo Insights as well. \nJian Li: Great. Wonderful. And then just a quick follow-up on the GPV strengths that you're seeing. If you can parse it out a little bit, is that more customer attached growing? Is it more just the growing GPV per customer? And it's coming from WordPress marketing? Or more on the managed WordPress side? If you can just talk about also the growth of these 2 segments separately as well. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Thanks, Jian. The biggest piece of the driver for the GPV growth is actually converting our customers in the base. And a lot of that has to do with a broader solution than just the online solution, right? We have our hardware. We own the full stack from the hardware to the operating system on it to the applications on top of it. And what we're taking, really, is sort of this omnicommerce solution that we're trying to bundle in different ways and target to the customers that we have. So that's actually the biggest driver of the GPV. And it's a fantastic driver for GPV, right?\n We want to be in-store with the customer and online. We don't want to be just online with the customer. We want to sort of have access to all of their business. And that's what we're doing with the base of our customers. And very often, it starts with a sale of a piece of a hardware, and that's a great start. \nMark McCaffrey: And like we've always said, the biggest opportunity in front of us for commerce is converting our existing customer base. That's where we're seeing the growth in the GPV today. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. \nElizabeth Elliott: I wanted to ask again on Airo. We're clearly seeing the benefit with more attach and ARPU, but I wanted to better understand how Airo might be changing any sort of top-of-funnel demand. You noted some stronger gross customer adds. And then second, what is the potential implication on improving customer growth after some muted growth over the last couple of years? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. On Airo changing the top of the funnel, we're excited about being able to market the GoDaddy brand as a provider of not just this expansive set of products and capabilities, but the provider that can bring you those capabilities in a seamless, intuitive almost magical manner. So Airo is not just an experience for our customers, not just a platform that GoDaddy has, it's something we're taking into our marketing and looking at ways to really dive into customer perception. \n And if the customer thinks about GoDaddy and thinks about domains, Airo is going to help the customer think about GoDaddy and think about a lot of things together. So that is the largest piece of shifting the top of the funnel with Airo, Elizabeth, if that makes sense, is really taking the go-to-market plan for Airo into every bit of our marketing into every channel that we have and making that really, really successful.\n In terms of customer growth, yes, we absolutely see, in the medium and long term, a growing customer base or GoDaddy. We see that as a key sort of point of growth. We have the brand awareness globally that is fantastic. Like, it's unparalleled. We have amazing products to bring to them. We have plenty of firepower in our P&L to be able to reach those customers, right? So we absolutely believe there are a lot more customers for GoDaddy to reach and add to that $21 million every year. \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. And we continue to be impacted by the divestitures and migrations that we've talked about. A lot of that's peaking in Q2 as some of these are starting to lap, but will abate over time. And as I always say in these scenarios, while we're attracting more of the customers with a higher intent that are attaching to that second product and they're engaging on the bundles and is very, very happy with, on the back end, we're losing what I call low-calorie customers that weren't really in there with any intent. So we're happy with the model. It should start to abate over time, and then we'll keep everybody posted on a quarterly basis. \nElizabeth Elliott: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then a follow-up on the margin side of the equation. There's the kind of mix shift to ANC, also leverage as revenue growth reaccelerates and you guys are taking also some specific kind of cost actions to manage expenses. So just wondering if there's any way to, like, stack rank some of these drivers as it relates to the margin expansion that you guys have in the outlook. \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Elizabeth, I look at it in 3 buckets. We have the, what I would say, the tailwind related to AMC growing at a higher profit point, which continues to be, I would say, a big driver. The other big driver is our access to global talent pools now is our international base grows, our ability to move into markets that are more cost effective is helping us.\n And then I would say the third, probably not as big as the other 2, but the third continues to be our infrastructure simplification. And that is just getting more efficient, reducing the amount of locations we have, getting out of leases, that type of environment. So those 3 buckets are the big contributors to how we continue to expand our margin, and that will continue as we go into the outer years. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young at Barclays. \nTrevor Young: On aftermarket, second consecutive quarter here of double-digit growth, but meanwhile, it looks like your full year expectations there are still kind of in low single-digit territory. What's driving that outsized growth right now? It looks like ATVs are up almost 20% on the year plus the benefit of easier compares. Just trying to understand if something has structurally changed in demand for that business. What's causing that resurgence? And relatedly, what would cause it to slow from here? \nMark McCaffrey: Thanks, Trevor. And we definitely have seen a pick up, what I would say, in the average transaction value. And in Q1, we saw the return of the larger transactions that have been missing in the prior periods. Again, we don't build that into the model because they come in on the short term, and they can create some volatility. But we were -- we did see the benefit of that and the 12% growth in aftermarket this quarter.\n From a steady-state point of view, we still think this is a business that is going to be low single-digit growth. We're continuing to see the volume at the lower end grow. We're continuing to see good average transaction value with the lower end grow. But we definitely saw the benefit in Q1 of some of those larger transactions. But like we've said, we don't build that into the model and we only build in what we can see right in front of us. \nTrevor Young: That makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on the Heart Internet sale. How much of a drag will that be on hosting revs? And was that previously contemplated in the '24 guide? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. I think the best way to say that, we previously contemplated that when we were talking about our guide for this year. We hadn't closed it and announced it, but we're far enough along we built it into the model. \nTrevor Young: Okay. And anything on sizing the drag? \nMark McCaffrey: We look at it as overall. The divestitures are about 100 basis points for the year with that peaking in the second quarter and abating through the rest of the year. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of John Byun from Jefferies. \nSang-Jin Byun: John Byun for Brent Thill. You pushed through the price increases on productivity and now on payments. I'm just wondering how much pricing power is left, especially given it seems a lot of SMBs is still somewhat struggling. And then on that last point, I know there was a question earlier on macro, but anything you could share on the health of the SMBs? Anything different this Q1 versus last quarter? I don't know if there's any change, whether better or worse in terms of the SMB health and sentiment. \nAmanpal Bhutani: John, on the pricing and bundling, I just want to clarify a little bit. These are not push pricing changes. It really is an approach to create new and differentiated bundles, to have pricing that's value-based. It's differentiated. It's not sort of a simple price increase that one might see. All of the pricing and bundling capabilities are based on sort of large-scale data and machine learning. We see -- we have a very large customer base the more we apply this thinking. We do see some runway in front of us to do that. And so we think it's a great lever.\n I'll maybe point back to our growth and margin drivers slide during the Investor Day and sort of pricing and bundling was the biggest pillar. Because, again, it's not just about price increase. It's about creating the right bundle and pricing it in a dynamic manner to get the best return, both for bookings growth and for renewal at the same time. So that's just a little bit of context for how you might think about our pricing and bundling initiative.\n In terms of the macro, I think the best word we've used is sort of we see a steadiness to the macro, and we think that's a positive. We think, for our customers, they always tend to be an optimistic group. We never do a survey with our customers and they never come back with sort of, \"Oh, I think the world -- the sky's falling.\" They're always optimistic about their business. And the steady macro, I think, just helps them have a little bit more optimism. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich from UBS. \nChristopher Kuntarich: Great. Maybe just first one would be around pay walls. Can you just unpack a little bit what you mean by that in the use of that around Airo? Second question would be just back to marketing. Aman, you were calling out, really, just kind of the strength of GoDaddy's brand overall at this point. We saw some really nice leverage in the first quarter. Just, how should we be thinking about kind of leverage for the remainder of the year? And what's kind of predicated in that guide from a marketing perspective? And maybe kind of how you think about using -- continuing to -- or needing to continue to push on Airo awareness versus maybe more lower funnel tactics? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. Let me start by talking about the Airo pay wall. The type of thing we're talking about is you buy a domain name and suddenly, you've got a logo, you've got a coming soon website created. You've got 8 versions of websites created that you can choose one from. You've got an e-mail address that's been created for you. You've got a pay link that's ready to go. You can take payments on it, 60 seconds later, right? You've got a marketing campaigns that are set up for you already. \n We're looking for engagement and we're gathering data about how customers engage with these different capabilities of products, the cards, as we call them, right? The pay wall is a technology which basically looks at that usage, and at a certain point of value created for the customer, it will interrupt the customer and say, hey, if you want, let's say, a better logo or if you want to improve this website in a certain way or you want to edit this website here, you actually have to start to have a paid plan. \n Like it was great that you had -- that Airo did all this work for you and we love it that you love it, but at this point now, you have to pay for it, right? And that's pay wall and sort of being having the ability to dynamically become part of the customer journey and introduce friction where you want to get paid is a sophisticated sort of capability that SaaS companies have. And I'm very excited to have it at GoDaddy too, right?\n And Airo, given its breadth of products, really offers us the capability to have lots of different pay walls that were tests. So I shared an example, I think, in the past about a pay wall for websites. But slowly, what you're going to see is us sort of understanding the customer journey, the flow and then interrupting that and looking to sort of sign up with a subscription with that customer.\n And in terms of marketing, as I said, we're -- I'm going to say this, and Mark will probably say something related to it, and we laugh about it sometimes internally. I'd, of course, like to spend a lot on marketing with Airo and tell the whole world about the capability we have. But we're very disciplined in our approach of looking at the return on marketing. \n And that has to do with my history, going back many, many years, relying on gathering a lot of data, how is our market, how our marketing channels are working, how are we really getting value from them. So we'll continue to stay super-disciplined and look to spend whatever we can within our guidelines. But I think in terms of leverage for the year, Mark, do you want to\u2026 \nMark McCaffrey: Yes, and this applies to marketing and all investments, really, at the end of the day. We like to use the data in order to understand what's going to get us the best return. And when we feel we understand that, we're willing to invest in. Marketing is the same thing for us, right? We want to get to the point where we understand the monetization formula and then we can start to optimize for that. So we feel good about our ability to make those decisions across the board and to leverage across all of our P&L. And obviously, our ability to continue to expand the margins, especially as we see the uptick in AMC and the tailwind that, that gives us go on to the future. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. \nNaved Khan: So just a quick question on the booking growth for AMC. It's pretty impressive. And in your commentary, you kind of attributed that to pricing and bundling. I just want to develop, like, on that. Is it more bundling versus pricing that's kind of driving this? How should we understand it from the outside looking in?\n And then at the Investor Day, Aman, I think you talked about value-based pricing and leveraging dynamic pricing and things like that. How much of that is happening currently? And how much scope of that is there to kind of do it further and more broadly? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes, Naved, thanks for that question. So the approach we've taken with value-based pricing is that the pricing and bundling initiatives sort of works together on it, if you will. They go hand in hand. Because it's really looking at what the engagement is for that customer, what value that customer has, what bundles and services that we can create for them and then how should we price that.\n And where we -- and Mark talked a little bit about the areas where we've already invested in that. We actually want to take that thing across our whole portfolio. So sitting here, we do believe, as we said at Investor Day, there's sort of at least 3 years of goodness for us that we see with the pricing and bundling initiative. And we're excited about going after that opportunity because we do have a huge base, 21 million customers, that we can approach with that type of thinking. \nNaved Khan: No, that's what I wanted to kind of get a better handle on. It seems like you're leveraging both kind of ultimately get the sale done or renewal happen. Maybe just a quick follow-up on CapEx. It wasn't discussed. Should I just assume it stays where you guided to it at the beginning of the year? Or maybe has it changed? \nMark McCaffrey: Full year guide hasn't changed. It could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we're, overall, reducing our spend year-over-year. \nChristie Masoner: Our next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. \nAlexei Gogolev: Mark, I was wondering if you could give us some insight how we can grow ARR was doing this year? And what is your expectation for the rest of the year? \nMark McCaffrey: Yes. Without getting into the specifics of growth rate around ARR, Alexei, just remember, it is our lagging of our lagging indicators. So generally, we'll trail revenue, not only in the bookings to revenue formula, but it also trails the revenue to -- in the trailing 12 months that impacts it. So while we expect to see a healthy growth in ARPU, that we -- again, it's going to lag throughout the year, but it will continue to increase over time.\n On ARR, we continue to look at it growing as our subscription base continues to grow. It is a good sign of health. We continue to see that ARR has been very healthy in our applications and commerce as well as very steady within our core platform. We continue to say that subscription revenue should be 1 to 2 points ahead of overall -- sorry, subscription bookings should be 1 to 2 points ahead of revenue throughout the year. \nAlexei Gogolev: Okay. And then the second question was about WorldPay partnership. Could you provide an update on how it's faring and also, that significant improvement in total GPV or annualized GPV, has there been any tailwind coming from that WorldPay partnership? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Yes. The WorldPay partnership isn't driving the GPV growth necessarily. And we like the partnership with WorldPay. We're excited about with the new team there. It's doing -- obviously, they had a lot going on over the last few months, but we think they're in a great place. We're very excited about the product offering we have with them, and we're excited about them sort of selling more and more every month. So that's where we're at. But our GPV is mostly growing without selling into our own base. \nChristie Masoner: And our last question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi again. \nYgal Arounian: Last week, Verisign made some comments about how they're going to kind of ramp up marketing spend, in particular. How they're going to work a little bit more one-on-one with their distributor partners to try to open up the funnel for dotcom in particular. So -- and I'm getting a lot of questions, and there's been a lot of interest from investors on that point, so I thought I'd just ask it from your point of view and what that might mean for you. \n What you're seeing on dotcom or just in general as both a registrar and registry, what you guys are seeing in kind of like the -- I know you have broader exposure, so what you're seeing in that disparity in dotcom versus total domains. And if you're getting a little bit more support from Verisign, does that mean more efficiency in marketing spend where you can kind of spend a little bit more, you open up the top of the funnel a little bit more? Just what can that mean for your business? \nAmanpal Bhutani: Thanks, Ygal. I think you kind of answered the question. We have diversified portfolio of domains, right? You're familiar with it. We have the opportunity to sell over 400 different TLDs. The opportunity to have massive brand awareness globally. We are in more markets than any other domain registrar what have you, right? And then we have the opportunity to really create merchandising and offerings that are unique compared to other players. So we think we have a great diversified portfolio on domains. Obviously, we love all our partners. And if a large partner wants to do more, we're always happy to do more. We want to work with everyone. \nChristie Masoner: We have now finished the Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Aman. \nAmanpal Bhutani: Thank you for joining us. We'll see you in a quarter. Bye-bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Amanpal Bhutani",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy relentlessly focuses on creating customer value and successfully transitions it to shareholder value. This is the driving force behind our profitable growth model, that maximizes free cash flow. I'm excited by the innovative experiences we are delivering for our customers, the dedication and velocity of execution of our teams and the trajectory those have created for our company. \n At our Investor Day, we shared our updated 3-year strategic framework and financial targets. As our Q1 results showcase, we are off to a strong start in 2024. In service of our North Star, we continue to expand our free cash flow meaningfully delivering 26% free cash flow growth year-over-year. The pillars behind our North Star are accelerating growth in our applications and commerce segment and disciplined margin expansion. \n In Q1, applications and commerce bookings accelerated to 22% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded 400 basis points. At our Investor Day, we also shared our progress on the GoDaddy software platform. The GoDaddy software platform helped create game-changing customer experiences like GoDaddy Airo. It combines the power of our infrastructure, large-scale data, AI and machine learning, experimentation and monetization to power our growth and margin drivers. \n Today, I wanted to provide an update on 4 of the key initiatives we shared previously. First, enhancing our pricing and bundling capabilities remains an important lever for GoDaddy. This quarter, we focused our pricing and bundling efforts on our productivity solutions which was a key contributor to the 22% bookings growth in applications and commerce segment. \n Our software platform has a vast amount of data and we leverage that data in more and more pricing and bundling experimentations. This gives us powerful insights on how and where to push forward as we continue to roll these learnings into additional products and bundles over time.\n Second, creating seamless experiences for our customers continues to be a key priority. We are removing friction out of every piece of the entrepreneurs' wheel, saving our customers' time and money. We continuously work on simplification and performance improvements that deliver value for our customers. \n Examples from this quarter include simplifying the editor in Websites + Marketing, making it easier for customers to discover new capabilities, reducing provisioning time for the online store to a few seconds and using AI to streamline manage WordPress website creation to just a few clicks. Simplified, smart, fast experiences come across as magical to our customers and customer delight creates customer value, increasing willingness to pay.\n Third, on commerce, I am pleased to share that annualized GPV continued to grow at a fast pace, surpassing the $2 billion milestone. The primary driver continues to be conversion within our existing base of customers. In addition, this quarter, we launched GoDaddy Smart Terminal Flex, a hand held device that allows our customers to accept payments anywhere on the fly.\n Our commerce offering is growing and sets us up well for our 2024 focus on driving higher-margin subscription revenue through the sale of tailored omnicommerce  solutions to our customers. The significant value we are driving with our commerce offerings also introduces an opportunity for us to evolve our pricing structure within payments. Last week, we began rolling out phased transaction fee increases across our customer population, while still maintaining our status as the best value in payments.\n Fourth, we continue to be tremendously excited about the range of possibilities with GoDaddy Airo. As planned, we started rolling out GoDaddy Airo to our base in late March. Go Daddy Airo opens the door to many opportunities across discovery, engagement and monetization and represents an incremental opportunity as a powerful growth driver over the next couple of years. We have continued to rapidly iterate this experience, and I wanted to share a couple of examples. \n More customers are discovering GoDaddy Airo, and we have more for them. We launched a new payment  card to test engagement with payments. A card is a visual representation of a product that is automatically set up and configured by GoDaddy Airo on just a domain purchase. We see early indication that GoDaddy Airo does a better job of discovery and engagement with pay links than our normal methods. \n Another significant change in monetization is that we introduced a pay wall for websites built by GoDaddy Airo. We are actively testing different points at which this pay wall can be triggered and this is a new flow that we are excited to optimize. \n While all this data is early, we are also excited to see that websites built by GoDaddy Airo are performing well. More domain customers are opting in for a website when we offer them GoDaddy Airo. And key product metrics are either ahead or within our expectations. These metrics give us confidence that we are achieving our goal of a seamless, intuitive, magical experience for our customers. \n I also wanted to quickly share that GoDaddy Airo domain search is now on the home page for all desktop users globally. And we are starting to test opportunities to optimize the traditional search experience using these new capabilities. \n Last but not least, GABI our guide assist bot, is now rolled out across our entire care footprint and is handling escalations and questions from our guides. GABI also helps with providing call summaries and case notes, helping our guides be more efficient. Every month that goes by GABI becomes smarter. And over time, we can add use cases and drive further adoption.\n In closing, we continue to deliver on our key initiatives and unlock new avenues of growth and value creation for the long term. The GoDaddy team is a driven group and shares an unwavering determination to fearlessly push boundaries and prioritize, continuously experiment, meticulously track results and strive for improvement each day. I am thrilled with the speed of execution as we continue to strive to exceed customer expectations, propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. \n With that, here's Mark. Thanks, Ygal. Super excited about Airo. It's the best vehicle we have built to carry products to our customers. We know it's doing very well with new customers. And as I've shared, we've started to roll it out to our base as well. Airo just does a fantastic job of getting our customers engaged. And the metrics that we shared around it, they continue to be about discovery, which means our customers finding that GoDaddy has all these products about engagement, where they start using those products or you can say, attach them and then monetization where they start to pay for those products.\n And we're very methodically moving through those 3 phases. What I can share today is that on discovery, we're seeing fantastic results there. Customers buy a domain, they see their cards, they engage with the cards, customers are starting to learn that GoDaddy has way more products for me, way more offerings for me. \n And I shared a little comment about pay links in the prepared remarks but I'll also share coming soon site, which is a one-page website that gets created with a domain, gets a great amount of engagement. Just regular website is getting more engagement with Airo than when we didn't have Airo. So these cards are really starting to take off in terms of discovery and engagement, which give us confidence that as we move towards monetization, we're going to have multiple levers at play. And we've started to build the pay walls and do stuff. And over the next couple of years, we think this will roll out very well and deliver results for years to come. Thanks, Mark. Our sort of value-based pricing, AI-based pricing and bundling initiatives have not gone across all A&C. It's starting to roll out across a lot. What you're seeing in the 22% application and then bookings growth is the combination of pricing and bundling, really touching our productivity and starting to hit our website business, too. So super excited about that. There is more to go there. So we're going to continue to invest in that area and go across not just AMC, but over time, go to every customers of GoDaddy and bringing them on to these new sort of pricing and bundling approach that we have. Yes, it's still early days, Mark, with our new customers. Obviously, that's a smaller stream of customers. With our new customers, we do see significant take rates for like a coming-soon website or actual website attach. We see that engagement -- sort of discovery and engagement and are doing really well. But the large, large opportunity, of course, is in our base. And we're literally not even 5, 6 weeks from putting Airo into our base. So it's going to take a little time, given the large customer base and our approach of going into it in a systematic manner. \n We have lots of learnings from taking productivity into our base, taking commerce into our base. We're taking that same methodical approach in going into the base. It's going to take a little bit more time for us to gather data to be able to sort of share it publicly to say this is what we see. But I can tell you, we're super excited about it. And if the new customer engagement is any indicator of the base, there will be years, many, many years, we'll be talking about this. Yes. We're very methodical, Ken, on our approach to pricing. And like we've talked about, everything is tested. So we have tests out there, as we said, it's on a phased basis. And we're really trying to create multiple offerings for our customers. And while we maintain our position in the industry for being the best value for money. It allows us to have differentiated products within our portfolio and reach more customers. \n So this is something you'll see more of, and we'll talk about it over the next few quarters. But, really, what it opens up -- us up for a broader commerce solution with differentiated pricing across different bundles. And we're trying to set things up for the same sort of mindset of pricing and bundling activity together for commerce as we are bringing [ available ] of products. Just a quick add, Ken, that our general term in just around 12 months, a little over. So that can give you sort of the idea of how bookings will take about 12 months, get distributed about over 12 months for revenue. Yes. The biggest sort of encouragement for our customers, the best vehicle we've put in place for pay link attach is being in Airo, right? And the way it happens is that when the customer buys the domain name, all these cards, all these capabilities get set up automatically. \n And we introduced pay link in a very similar way as we introduced the other capabilities. And what we found is we obviously had existing ways of helping our customers discover pay links, helping them engage with them and start to transact using pay links. But Airo sort of brought it together in a very simple manner. \n It was right there in front of customers and we saw the customers engage with it at significantly higher rates than without Airo. So that's what's driving sort of the engagement with pay links. Overall, for GPV, we did hit the $2 billion annualized GPV milestone this last quarter. And the biggest part of that continues to be going into our base of customers and converting them to GoDaddy payments. Yes. There are some customer events -- customer-side events, for example, like you said, a customer coming up on a renewal. That may create an opportunity. But what we really lead with is that we have a relationship with these customers, right? GoDaddy has 65-plus transactions in NPS and in Care. Our customers are used to having a great relationship with us. So when we engage them, number one, they're open to the idea of GoDaddy offering them GoDaddy Payments.\n The second pillar of what we approached them with is that we offer them the one-stop shop. They have other relationships with GoDaddy. We can introduce one bill, one partner to work with. We can make it easier, and that's attractive to our customers because a lot of them start by saying, \"Oh, I didn't even realize that you had payments.\" \"Oh, it's pretty great.\" \"Oh, I like the way this works.\" \"Oh, this works seamlessly with all my other stuff I do with GoDaddy.\" So that's a win for us too.\n And then you've got pricing that's the best value in the market today, which sort of comes in as a third pillar of that sales pitch. And what we continuously are finding is that, that works. That encourages our customers who have great relationships with us, who run micro businesses adopt GoDaddy Payments, and that's what's been driving our GPV growth. Vikram, a quick word on GABI. I'm super excited for what Gabby offers us over the long term, right? Being able to bring the massive amount of data that only GoDaddy has, working with 21 million paying customers and many more over the years, using AI to bring it together and putting it on the fingertips of every guide in the company, that's a powerful combination, right? And where we are is the tool is rolled out. The guys are starting to use it. There is, of course, always a little bit of time for adoption and training for people learning how to use even a new tool that's GenAI powered.\n But super excited about it. I mentioned a couple of use cases that are already live with GABI, where GABI's able to do the summaries or just start to take on tasks that otherwise guides would have had to do sort of start to move up from guides doing that -- to automation and GABI taking care of that. So there's lots of use cases we have in mind. We have a fantastic roadmap over the next couple of years in front of us. And yes, pretty excited about it. Thanks, Aaron. On the macro, I think the word we internally feel represents it best is a steadiness to the macro. And I think that's been a positive for us, right? We had and we talked about it in 2023, strong gross adds and customers coming -- continuing to come in at the top of the funnel. And of course, some divestitures and integrations as an offset to that for the company, which I look at that as a short-term gain. But good strong gross adds coming in.\n The steadiness in the macro, we believe, will continue to power that. And again, continuing to have a lot of firepower in terms of really efficient marketing at our disposal. Our marketing is getting better and better. It's driven with data and lots of opportunities for us to continue to explore to put more dollars at play and get really efficient returns on them. Yes. And I think the way you might think about it, a lot of value is being created for customers with Airo because they're getting a bundling -- bundled experience that's seamless, that's connected. And some of that monetization opportunity we have talked about like Airo Premium and pay walls, but there's also a monetization opportunity that would happen at renewals, but that would be a year out from the time the customer bought the domain. So just, Jian, keep that in mind as well.\n On your question on Airo features for Pro, the feature that I'm personally very excited about is Airo Insights, which is the capability where Airo assess an existing website and give super actionable advice to Pros and how to improve that website. We have a version of that, that's going to be able to work for customers, too. But that product, from the first day, from the ground up, it was built for Pros. Its first implementation is with WordPress and it's a fantastic product. Like, we get great engagement from pros on it. Again, as with all Airo products, that is still at the discovery and engagement phase. We have not added monetization yet. But this year, we expect to test a number of monetized methods for Airo Insights as well. Thanks, Jian. The biggest piece of the driver for the GPV growth is actually converting our customers in the base. And a lot of that has to do with a broader solution than just the online solution, right? We have our hardware. We own the full stack from the hardware to the operating system on it to the applications on top of it. And what we're taking, really, is sort of this omnicommerce solution that we're trying to bundle in different ways and target to the customers that we have. So that's actually the biggest driver of the GPV. And it's a fantastic driver for GPV, right?\n We want to be in-store with the customer and online. We don't want to be just online with the customer. We want to sort of have access to all of their business. And that's what we're doing with the base of our customers. And very often, it starts with a sale of a piece of a hardware, and that's a great start. Yes. On Airo changing the top of the funnel, we're excited about being able to market the GoDaddy brand as a provider of not just this expansive set of products and capabilities, but the provider that can bring you those capabilities in a seamless, intuitive almost magical manner. So Airo is not just an experience for our customers, not just a platform that GoDaddy has, it's something we're taking into our marketing and looking at ways to really dive into customer perception. \n And if the customer thinks about GoDaddy and thinks about domains, Airo is going to help the customer think about GoDaddy and think about a lot of things together. So that is the largest piece of shifting the top of the funnel with Airo, Elizabeth, if that makes sense, is really taking the go-to-market plan for Airo into every bit of our marketing into every channel that we have and making that really, really successful.\n In terms of customer growth, yes, we absolutely see, in the medium and long term, a growing customer base or GoDaddy. We see that as a key sort of point of growth. We have the brand awareness globally that is fantastic. Like, it's unparalleled. We have amazing products to bring to them. We have plenty of firepower in our P&L to be able to reach those customers, right? So we absolutely believe there are a lot more customers for GoDaddy to reach and add to that $21 million every year. John, on the pricing and bundling, I just want to clarify a little bit. These are not push pricing changes. It really is an approach to create new and differentiated bundles, to have pricing that's value-based. It's differentiated. It's not sort of a simple price increase that one might see. All of the pricing and bundling capabilities are based on sort of large-scale data and machine learning. We see -- we have a very large customer base the more we apply this thinking. We do see some runway in front of us to do that. And so we think it's a great lever.\n I'll maybe point back to our growth and margin drivers slide during the Investor Day and sort of pricing and bundling was the biggest pillar. Because, again, it's not just about price increase. It's about creating the right bundle and pricing it in a dynamic manner to get the best return, both for bookings growth and for renewal at the same time. So that's just a little bit of context for how you might think about our pricing and bundling initiative.\n In terms of the macro, I think the best word we've used is sort of we see a steadiness to the macro, and we think that's a positive. We think, for our customers, they always tend to be an optimistic group. We never do a survey with our customers and they never come back with sort of, \"Oh, I think the world -- the sky's falling.\" They're always optimistic about their business. And the steady macro, I think, just helps them have a little bit more optimism. Yes. Let me start by talking about the Airo pay wall. The type of thing we're talking about is you buy a domain name and suddenly, you've got a logo, you've got a coming soon website created. You've got 8 versions of websites created that you can choose one from. You've got an e-mail address that's been created for you. You've got a pay link that's ready to go. You can take payments on it, 60 seconds later, right? You've got a marketing campaigns that are set up for you already. \n We're looking for engagement and we're gathering data about how customers engage with these different capabilities of products, the cards, as we call them, right? The pay wall is a technology which basically looks at that usage, and at a certain point of value created for the customer, it will interrupt the customer and say, hey, if you want, let's say, a better logo or if you want to improve this website in a certain way or you want to edit this website here, you actually have to start to have a paid plan. \n Like it was great that you had -- that Airo did all this work for you and we love it that you love it, but at this point now, you have to pay for it, right? And that's pay wall and sort of being having the ability to dynamically become part of the customer journey and introduce friction where you want to get paid is a sophisticated sort of capability that SaaS companies have. And I'm very excited to have it at GoDaddy too, right?\n And Airo, given its breadth of products, really offers us the capability to have lots of different pay walls that were tests. So I shared an example, I think, in the past about a pay wall for websites. But slowly, what you're going to see is us sort of understanding the customer journey, the flow and then interrupting that and looking to sort of sign up with a subscription with that customer.\n And in terms of marketing, as I said, we're -- I'm going to say this, and Mark will probably say something related to it, and we laugh about it sometimes internally. I'd, of course, like to spend a lot on marketing with Airo and tell the whole world about the capability we have. But we're very disciplined in our approach of looking at the return on marketing. \n And that has to do with my history, going back many, many years, relying on gathering a lot of data, how is our market, how our marketing channels are working, how are we really getting value from them. So we'll continue to stay super-disciplined and look to spend whatever we can within our guidelines. But I think in terms of leverage for the year, Mark, do you want to... Yes, Naved, thanks for that question. So the approach we've taken with value-based pricing is that the pricing and bundling initiatives sort of works together on it, if you will. They go hand in hand. Because it's really looking at what the engagement is for that customer, what value that customer has, what bundles and services that we can create for them and then how should we price that.\n And where we -- and Mark talked a little bit about the areas where we've already invested in that. We actually want to take that thing across our whole portfolio. So sitting here, we do believe, as we said at Investor Day, there's sort of at least 3 years of goodness for us that we see with the pricing and bundling initiative. And we're excited about going after that opportunity because we do have a huge base, 21 million customers, that we can approach with that type of thinking. Yes. The WorldPay partnership isn't driving the GPV growth necessarily. And we like the partnership with WorldPay. We're excited about with the new team there. It's doing -- obviously, they had a lot going on over the last few months, but we think they're in a great place. We're very excited about the product offering we have with them, and we're excited about them sort of selling more and more every month. So that's where we're at. But our GPV is mostly growing without selling into our own base. Thanks, Ygal. I think you kind of answered the question. We have diversified portfolio of domains, right? You're familiar with it. We have the opportunity to sell over 400 different TLDs. The opportunity to have massive brand awareness globally. We are in more markets than any other domain registrar what have you, right? And then we have the opportunity to really create merchandising and offerings that are unique compared to other players. So we think we have a great diversified portfolio on domains. Obviously, we love all our partners. And if a large partner wants to do more, we're always happy to do more. We want to work with everyone. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you in a quarter. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Mark McCaffrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman. We are pleased to announce our strong Q1 results and continued track record of durable growth. We've demonstrated attractive progress toward our North Star, delivering strong free cash flow of $327 million, alongside continued execution of our capital allocation strategy, which reduced our fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter to 146 million.\n The key pillars underlying our North Star are the double-digit growth in our application and commerce segment revenue of 13%, coupled with disciplined normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 28%, which converts to free cash flow and an impressive 1:1 ratio. \n Through our seamless technology and comprehensive one-stop shop approach, we are building improved customer value. Our strategic focus is delivering results that drive better attach and conversion while maintaining impressive retention rates. Together, these efforts are building a foundation for enduring shareholder value. \n Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis, and exceeding the high end of our guided range on the strength of the pricing and bundling initiative as well as strong demand in our aftermarket. ARPU grew 5% to $206 on a trailing 12-month basis and our customer count remains stable despite the headwinds from our divestiture and migration efforts, also impacting revenue by approximately 100 basis points. \n Additionally, customers with 2 or more products remained above 50% and our customer retention rate remained at 85%. Double-clicking into the segments, our higher-margin Applications & Commerce segment delivered $383 million in revenue, growing 13%, in line with our guided range. The drivers of this performance included strength in our bundling and pricing initiative across all major product offering, including productivity solutions, website building products and commerce.\n Additionally, annualized GPV for GoDaddy payments grew to $2 billion for the first time. Segment EBITDA margin was 42%, up over 300 basis points. Lastly, ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 13% to $1.5 billion. Core platform revenue totaled $725 million, growing 4% which exceeded our guide on strength in domains, up 7% and aftermarket, up 12%. \n Our growth was driven by strong demand for domains in the primary and secondary market, increased pricing in the primary market and a higher average transaction value in the secondary market. This was partially offset by a decrease in hosting our divestitures. Segment EBITDA margin for core platform grew to 30%, up nearly 300 basis points. Lastly, ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, up 3%. Consolidated normalized EBITDA grew 25% to $313 million, while delivering an expanded margin of 28%, up 400 basis points, exceeding our guide. Margin expansion was driven by continued leverage gains within all expense line items on the P&L. \n Moving on to bookings. In Q1, we achieved 9% growth on our reported and constant currency basis, reaching $1.3 billion. As a reminder, bookings primarily represent the cash collected during the period. Applications in commerce bookings grew 22% from improvements in pricing and bundling for productivity solutions, website building products and commerce. Core platform bookings increased 3% on the performance of domains in aftermarket on strong demand for domains in the primary and secondary market, offset by headwinds in hosting.\n Subscription bookings grew 2 points ahead of subscription revenue. The impressive momentum in our bookings, coupled with our commitment to profitable growth and ability to convert normalized EBITDA to free cash flow at a ratio of 1:1 powers our substantial cash generation. \n Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 18% to $359 million and free cash flow grew 26% to $327 million. We are committed to effectively managing our balance sheet and the proactive measures we took to reprice our long-term debt resulted in a 30% favorable change in cash interest payments compared to last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were also down 81% from data center divestitures. \n Through April 30, we repurchased 2.8 million shares year-to-date, totaling $346 million. This brings the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations to $2.9 billion and 37 million shares, reducing gross shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations by 22%, ahead of our 3-year targeted reduction of 20%. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were 146 million shares. \n Our successful share repurchase program continues to drive impressive ROI for our free cash flow deployment. We have $1.1 billion remaining under our current authorization, and we plan to be in the market every quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors, with a minimum offset to share-based compensation dilution. \n Moving to the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $664 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt was $3.2 billion, representing net leverage of 2.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. \n Shifting to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we are raising the lower end of the range for our full year revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be between $4.5 billion and $4.56 billion, representing growth of 6.5% at the midpoint. Additionally, we are targeting Q2 total revenue in the range of $1.1 million to $1.12 billion, representing growth of 6% at the midpoint of our range. We expect applications in commerce to deliver low to mid-teens growth for Q2 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver low single-digit growth in the second quarter and the full year. \n We are proud of our track record of margin expansion, and we will continue to maintain operational discipline to drive further leverage in our model. We expect normalized EBITDA for Q2 to be approximately 28%. Additionally, we remain on track to meet 31% normalized EBITDA margin in Q4. Full year normalized EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We are on track for our full year unlevered free cash flow and free cash flow targets of $1.4 billion plus and $1.2 billion plus, respectively. \n On capital allocation, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for shareholder return, subjecting them to our published rigorous returns-based framework to ensure we achieve the optimal mix for cash flow deployment. The entire GoDaddy team remains committed to delivering against the 3-year framework we shared at Investor Day with 6% to 8% annual top-line growth fueled by our Applications & Commerce segment, accelerating normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 33% by 2026 and generation of $4.5 billion plus in cumulative free cash flow.\n Our profitable growth and 1:1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow ratio, coupled with our disciplined capital allocation framework, creates significant value for our shareholders. While I am pleased with our progress towards our North Star, we are far from done, and I continue to have strong confidence in our strategy and execution. \n With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open the call for questions. Ygal, thanks for the question. We couldn't be more excited about the bookings growth in A&C and the momentum we have coming out of Q1 and the impact on the rest of the year, no doubt about it. As we get into the bundling, just a reminder, revenue is recognized from the bookings and it can be on different periods of time. So that momentum will continue. But given the size of our business, obviously, it takes a while to show up into the revenue growth numbers as we go on, couldn't be more excited about it, though.\n Just a reminder too, we do have a few headwinds out there relating to the dispositions. Those will peak in Q2. We expect them to abate throughout the year. But again, we still have a few of those headwinds out there. So again, we have great momentum, but we're trying to balance some of the actions that we took. \n So when you put that all together, I would say we're comfortable that lowering the low end of the guide was the appropriate thing to do, and we'll continue to keep everyone updated as we go throughout the rest of the year. But yes, we are pretty excited about some of the pricing and bundling initiatives and the impact they had on Q1 bookings. Yes. And I'll take it up a level, too. When we think about the bookings to revenue, we have multiple different products, multiple different terms, the revenue can be -- come out in many different ways. The way we look at it is we think bookings is going to be 1 to 2 points ahead of revenue for 2024. And that'll give us a lot of momentum as we continue to see the results of the bundling and pricing initiative as well as the momentum we're seeing in things like aftermarket. Yes. Hey, Vik. And Vik, on the normalized EBITDA margin, I would say, quarter-to-quarter, you may see some fluctuations depending on the timing of spend. Overall, if you look at Q1, we've always said accelerated A&C will be a tailwind to our ability to expand our margins over time. And with the pacing you saw in Q1, we saw some of the benefit of that. For the year, we're on track for the 31% to exit, and we feel good about that, and we're on track for the 29% for the entire year. And obviously, we've talked about our ability to expand that going out. And all those -- all that framework remains in place, and we continue to see the benefit of the ANC tailwind related to that. Yes. Thanks, Jian. And I'll start with the first part, and Aman will probably answer the second part there. The way we're looking at Airo right now, we are in the discovery and the engagement phase. We haven't hit the monetization phase. We're very early on. We're looking at all the statistics. We're looking at the level of engagement around it, but nothing has been built into our bookings or revenue for that matter in our model today. And like we've always said, the biggest opportunity in front of us for commerce is converting our existing customer base. That's where we're seeing the growth in the GPV today. Yes. And we continue to be impacted by the divestitures and migrations that we've talked about. A lot of that's peaking in Q2 as some of these are starting to lap, but will abate over time. And as I always say in these scenarios, while we're attracting more of the customers with a higher intent that are attaching to that second product and they're engaging on the bundles and is very, very happy with, on the back end, we're losing what I call low-calorie customers that weren't really in there with any intent. So we're happy with the model. It should start to abate over time, and then we'll keep everybody posted on a quarterly basis. Yes. Elizabeth, I look at it in 3 buckets. We have the, what I would say, the tailwind related to AMC growing at a higher profit point, which continues to be, I would say, a big driver. The other big driver is our access to global talent pools now is our international base grows, our ability to move into markets that are more cost effective is helping us.\n And then I would say the third, probably not as big as the other 2, but the third continues to be our infrastructure simplification. And that is just getting more efficient, reducing the amount of locations we have, getting out of leases, that type of environment. So those 3 buckets are the big contributors to how we continue to expand our margin, and that will continue as we go into the outer years. Thanks, Trevor. And we definitely have seen a pick up, what I would say, in the average transaction value. And in Q1, we saw the return of the larger transactions that have been missing in the prior periods. Again, we don't build that into the model because they come in on the short term, and they can create some volatility. But we were -- we did see the benefit of that and the 12% growth in aftermarket this quarter.\n From a steady-state point of view, we still think this is a business that is going to be low single-digit growth. We're continuing to see the volume at the lower end grow. We're continuing to see good average transaction value with the lower end grow. But we definitely saw the benefit in Q1 of some of those larger transactions. But like we've said, we don't build that into the model and we only build in what we can see right in front of us. Yes. I think the best way to say that, we previously contemplated that when we were talking about our guide for this year. We hadn't closed it and announced it, but we're far enough along we built it into the model. We look at it as overall. The divestitures are about 100 basis points for the year with that peaking in the second quarter and abating through the rest of the year. Yes, and this applies to marketing and all investments, really, at the end of the day. We like to use the data in order to understand what's going to get us the best return. And when we feel we understand that, we're willing to invest in. Marketing is the same thing for us, right? We want to get to the point where we understand the monetization formula and then we can start to optimize for that. So we feel good about our ability to make those decisions across the board and to leverage across all of our P&L. And obviously, our ability to continue to expand the margins, especially as we see the uptick in AMC and the tailwind that, that gives us go on to the future. Full year guide hasn't changed. It could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we're, overall, reducing our spend year-over-year. Yes. Without getting into the specifics of growth rate around ARR, Alexei, just remember, it is our lagging of our lagging indicators. So generally, we'll trail revenue, not only in the bookings to revenue formula, but it also trails the revenue to -- in the trailing 12 months that impacts it. So while we expect to see a healthy growth in ARPU, that we -- again, it's going to lag throughout the year, but it will continue to increase over time.\n On ARR, we continue to look at it growing as our subscription base continues to grow. It is a good sign of health. We continue to see that ARR has been very healthy in our applications and commerce as well as very steady within our core platform. We continue to say that subscription revenue should be 1 to 2 points ahead of overall -- sorry, subscription bookings should be 1 to 2 points ahead of revenue throughout the year."
