With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.\nDonald Slager: Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication, and commitment, we delivered record setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high-end of the original guidance we provided last February. During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year, generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow, even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes, expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%, improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%, increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%, and achieved record setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our number one strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record-setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provides the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call. Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll-off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to, again, thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of the pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year. With that, let me turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Ark: Thanks, Don. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years. Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yield to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021. During the fourth quarter volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels. Fourth quarter small container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130-basis-point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to the volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021. Next turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90-basis-point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in in-plant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above average growth rates. We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions, and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 67% to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to $66 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume. Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience. I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021. Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society, while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long-term. As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future. In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond. Our sustainability performance continues to be well-regarded, as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones sustainability World and North America indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time.  I will now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1. This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was $0.16 above the high-end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 from this resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs, while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsize margin expansion is a direct result of pricing and excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working in utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile. We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased $62 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital. Working capital included a one and a half day improvement in DSO and a two and a half day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes. Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid 40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially, but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison. During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately $60 million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1 times. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately 16% for the year. When you further consider non-cash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021, made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of non-cash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single digit to low double-digit growth. With that operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. I guess, the first question and you touched on it at various points in the prepared remarks, but maybe if you could just go a little deeper into sort of underlying trends that you're seeing, service increases, how much of sort of COVID impacted revenue is yet to come back, any way you want to frame that, and maybe how does that position you for 2021 and beyond? One of your competitors said that, waste is a reopening play. The market, obviously, isn't giving credit for that, but just -- sort of just give us a flavor of underlying trends and how you're positioned long-term.\nDonald Slager: Sure. Hamzah, thanks for the question. Yeah. We're feeling really good about the trends we're seeing. You mentioned service decreases -- increases. We continue to see more increases than decreases. We're seeing the business come back. We're seeing people get back to work. We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing. I mentioned the pipeline being strong, so we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked -- as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in 2020, we expect to hold on to. But looking at pricing, pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market's coming back and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it, as we go through time, but that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as alongside of it. And then I think, there's a little bit talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business, a little inflation will help CPI pickup. So, we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business. Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here at 2021 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now. And it's just a matter of pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year. But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon guys.\nDonald Slager: Hi, Tyler. \nJon Ark: Good afternoon.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Brian. So, in the implied guidance, how much of a rollover benefit from M&A you have baked in there?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. From a top line perspective, Tyler, we've got about 150 basis points of top line rollover in the guide.\nTyler Brown: Okay. And to be clear, that incorporates what you spent late in 2020, and what you expect to spend in early 2021, just so to be clear?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: But that's just what\u2019s actually closed through the end of 2020.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then Brian, I know you guys did such a good job on managing margins in 2020. I think you're maybe only guiding to say a 10 basis point improvement. My hunch is, there's quite a bit moving in there. So, can you kind of talk about some of the puts and takes there, maybe recycling to the benefit, core expansion, and then maybe what are some of the takes like maybe healthcare or M&A dilution? Just any help there.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'll give you the puts and takes there in a second, but just kind of to further Don's comment, one of the things I think you have to appreciate is when you take a look at our 2020 performance, we're coming off of triple digit margin expansion, which I think really differentiates us from our peers, and we're talking about furthering its margin expansion from here, and we don't think we're done after we get through 2021. But if you take a look at the puts and takes what's underlying that 29.5%, we're looking at underlying expansion of call it somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we've kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together to your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those two is about a 20-basis-point headwind to margin. And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year one. That's predominantly just from the integration and the transaction in the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So, while it's diluted in year one, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year two and beyond.\nTyler Brown: Yeah. No, core expansion, that's kind of the message though.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Core expansion of 50 basis points. And again, that's the -- really the important story here is that's on the heels of really strong margin expansion in 2020.\nDonald Slager: And then underlying -- or the headline story is -- 30% is right there in our sites, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Yeah. Yeah. I'm aware of that. Hey, Jon really quick. Do you have any specific thoughts about 2021 MSW landfill yield trends? Do you expect that to maybe step up? And I am curious how much of that line is indexed to CPI? Is it quite a bit?\nJon Ark: Yeah. look, we have -- we're probably six or seven quarters into a substantial step up in landfill average yield, right. Over 3.2% for the quarter and we expect it to be strong again in 2021. And to your point, a chunk of that volume is certainly tied to contracted business and tied to some inflation-based index. So, as CPI goes up, we get inflation, that should put upward pressure on it. But I also just think people have realized landfills are expensive to operate. And so, we need to price for the investments we make into those assets, and that's put upward pressure on MSW price or landfill pricing more broadly again across the last couple of years, and I don't see that trend abating at all.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Yes. Appreciate the time. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKyle White: Hey, good afternoon. Hope everyone's doing well. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to talk about on contract now that we're basically a year from when this pandemic started, has any of the terms or contract structures changed as a result as you kind of approach new renewals, maybe particularly on the resi side?\nDonald Slager: Yeah. We've gotten over a hundred customers to amend the terms primarily on municipal residential contracts, because weights have increased. Now in April and the immediacy of the shock when everyone was sheltering in place, weights were up about 10%. That's modulating to be down to 5%. But then that's still -- in those contracts with those are time and weight-based contracts. And so as we get heavy, we need a price for that. As that number dissipates and there's some modulators people get back to work, those -- more of those pricing renewals will come in the normal cycle of price -- a contract changes versus out of cycle contract changes. But that is not a high margin part of the business for us and all the players in the industry. So, we absolutely have to get paid for the work we do there.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Kyle, I think if you actually take a look at the overall average yield performance, you've seen in that residential business, 3% plus pricing the last two quarters, and that's where you're going to see as we renegotiate and change the structure of those contracts, that's where you're going to see it.\nKyle White: Got it. That makes sense. And then on electrification of vehicles, you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks. Maybe you can just talk a little bit more about your strategy and how it's different from some of your competitors. And then also, I know you had the partnership in the quarter that ended, and I'm curious if there's any kind of ramifications from that? And then just maybe the rationale of the partnership with Romeo.\nDonald Slager: Sure. Yeah. Listen, we think electrification is exciting technology for a couple of reasons. One, it's truly the only zero-based emission technology out there. CNG is incrementally better than diesel, but only incrementally a better than that. So, it's the right technology long-term. And our application tends to be a perfect one for electrification, because range anxiety is a big issue in trucking for electrification. And we don't have that as our trucks come home to the same location every night and you can get into overnight charging. So, we're really excited about the technology. And we're going to get there. We've always said there's going to be multiple paths to get there, and there's going to be some uncertainty. The destination is clear. The path to get there has some uncertainty. So, we've got a number of different relationships going on, pilots with multiple manufacturers. We talked about the Romeo investment. And in terms of the specific, partnership that we exited, right, disappointing for us, but that didn't cost us anything. That contract was very intentionally designed. It was performance based and the extent they couldn't execute against the performance. It costs us nothing on that front. So, disappointing again, because we're cheering for everybody to get there because we think it's good for the planet. But we are confident that we've got the right set of partners and we're going to be excited -- update you on our progress as we move forward.\nKyle White: Got it. I'll turn it over. Good luck in there.\nDonald Slager: Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So, on the M&A guide $600 million, you mentioned that it could be tuck-in. It could be new growth areas. First, can you give us a sense of what the rollover is there? I don't know if you touched on that, if you could repeat it? And really are you finding that the pipeline is -- as we come and exit through, is it getting -- is it changing day-to-day in terms of the availability of sellers, or are you going after any particular targeted areas or marketplaces that are starting to open up a little bit more? Just curious how things are changing kind of day-to-day with regards to the availability of sellers.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. So, let me just start with some of the numbers that you asked on the rollover. So, the rollover, right, by definition is that, which is closed in 2020, again, that's about 150 basis points.  Okay. So, again, the actual revenue contribution from the $600 million will be -- which of the deals that we intend to close in 2021, that'll be based on the timing of when they close. So, again, we're guiding on the top line organic growth, which is that combination of yield and volume, how much revenue we get in 2021, again, on the $600 million, we'll be more timing based than anything else.\nDonald Slager: Yeah. The pipeline remains strong and it remains balanced. Balanced across kind of core markets we're in the recycling and solid waste space. And obviously that's the bread and butter of our acquisition strategy. And those tuck-ins are highly creative. We're also looking at new geographies and have gotten into different -- spend the geographies in the last two to three years, which again provides new growth opportunities. And then also new parts of the business. So, we mentioned environmental solutions, and those are actually core customers of ours. We've done -- work for them for a long period of time. It's really expanding our product line into those customers, because they've asked us to do it. They want a provider who can provide digital solutions, who's got a great track record on safety and sustainability. And we're finding it attractive to expand our product set through acquisitions there as well.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. And then my follow-up just on capital allocation, obviously again, very resilient business, that came through clear. You're mentioning three times leverage and that looks good. I mean, there's been a whole range of kind of a little bit more aggressive to a little bit -- or a little less aggressive. What's your thought on how you weather this pandemic and what you can do to perhaps press the accelerate a little bit, especially with your pipeline you just mentioned, it is full and balanced. Could we see a little bit of higher leverage now that it seems that you can tolerate a little bit higher leverage to take advantage of that M&A opportunity?\nDonald Slager: Well, I would say one, we are weathering the pandemic and feel hopeful that we'll be on the other side of this thing before too long. So, as relates to leverage, we've always stated what our optimal leverage is. And we've been for the last couple of years and kind of keeping right in that three times, the good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow, and even increase the overall debt level, but keep your leverage pretty, pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right? So, we are -- we have in the past for the right deal increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 to 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to overlap with the company by any means, but we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done, getting deals through DOJ, accordingly getting assets sold as necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that and proven capability within our team. So, yeah, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change a regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling. A lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time and they start to think about selling their businesses, their retirement. So, we're right there to pick them up. Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position, but with the appetite to move into that number one or number two spot before too long, and that's still our approach. So, the pipeline is strong, the ability to get deals done, and integrate deals are strong and the balance sheet is strong. So we can't be in a better place.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Shows like excellent strategy. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Thanks for taking my question and good evening everybody. Maybe if I could just follow-up on the electric vehicle strategy. A question -- maybe just on the Romeo investment, can you remind me if any of the technology that you developed there, would that be proprietary to them, or is that something you could share with other OEMs as you look to eventually convert your fleet over time? And then secondly, you made a comment in your prepared remarks about electric being kind of the only -- maybe the only zero-carbon propulsion system. Just wondering how you think about hydrogen fuel cells? It seems like that's making a little bit of a push in Europe in terms of terms of waste to vehicle. Are you testing anything from that perspective, or was electric kind of the horse you're riding on now?\nDonald Slager: Yeah. Let me start with the second part and I'll work back to the first part of. The -- so yes, lots of work in Europe and everywhere else. Listen, innovation is going to have lots of people looking at lots of different things over time. If you look at where the balance of the global OEMs are, the investment on electrification in our space is dwarfing. The investment on hydrogen, most of our hydrogen investment has really been in the long haul space. And look, if we remain open-minded, right, as the technologies emerge and evolve, but I think it's -- we're pretty competent. Electrification is going to be the right technology for our application. And then we're working through the alliance with Romeo. We're -- they're not going to become an exclusive supplier to us by any means that wasn't the nature of the relationship and deal. However, we are working on proprietary things together and including a pilot where we retrofit one of our vehicles, because that's what the electrification to get it to scale. It's going to take a commitment and willingness to innovate, right? Trial and error, learning, testing, right? We'll adjust and over time, right, we'll kind of overcome those hurdles, and we will get to scale with the technology.\nKevin Chiang: That sound strategy and makes a ton of sense. And maybe just a housekeeping question, your comment on -- you commented that environmental should see -- I know a small part of your revenue stream, but it would see above average growth. Is there a way to think about maybe what that can look like? I don't know we going a quarterly revenue basis. I think it's been around kind of mid 20s a quarter the last couple of quarters here. Should we think of something like mid 30s or any goalpost might be helpful?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. The comment was a little bit more, I would say, on the top line as it relates. And again, back to the commentary was really that focused on the downstream portion of that business. So, again, as Jon mentioned, that's an area where we really feel like we can leverage our core capabilities. It's what we do already. So it's really just expanding that addressable market to those customers that are really looking for an integrated solution and really from a provider of someone like us. So, that's where we just feel like a combination of both organic growth opportunities, as well as through acquisition that we can see above average growth rates relative to what we may see on the solid waste side expressed as a percentage.\nKevin Chiang: Thank you. I appreciate the color. Have a great evening, everybody.\nDonald Slager: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the accelerated use of technology. I'm excluded -- I'm assuming that goes beyond what you talked about on the EV side. I know you've talked about the digital platform before. Can you talk a little bit about how you think technology might be changing your business over the next few years?\nDonald Slager: Yeah. Sure. So we started with our dispatch function. And so -- from the operation side, and that's where -- that's the team that really builds routes and directs the trucks out every morning and adjust those trucks sometimes in the middle of the day, so that we can service our customers. And we got them into a very visual based mapping structure that allows us to build routes more efficiently and frankly more effectively for customers to improve our delivery time and speed.  We're now in the process of rolling out technology into all of our vehicles. And so, now we'll have two way communication between dispatch and the vehicle. And we think that as a number of benefits. One, it allows us to provide a better employee experience. It certainly allows us to take more costs out of the system, because we're more efficient. And then it'll also allow us to connect to all of the customer facing investments we've made over time that allow us to provide service notification, verification and reporting, and a number of the benefits that customers want, which we think will help further differentiate our offering in the marketplace.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up -- I'm sorry to go back to the M&A contribution. I know you said it's 150 basis points for the deals that have closed. But I'm assuming that excludes Santek. One, can you confirm that? Two, can you just remind us how Santek is and what you paid for the business -- So we'll be paying? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. So, you're correct. Right, the 150 basis points that only includes acquisitions, which have closed. So that specifically exclude Santek. And we're not giving any sort of details on what we pay for Santek or for that matter any other deals.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeff Goldstein: Hey, good evening guys. Looking at your average yield guidance next year of 2.5%. How should we think about potential upside to that figure? Does it mostly revolve around increasing inflation? Is it around more success in your resi and renegotiations? Is it more commercial coming back online? Just what would be the most likely source of upside and looking at that estimate?\nDonald Slager: Well, it's all the above, right? There's a lot of mix issues that go into yield. Certainly, it is. CPI has an impact on our business as CPI moves up. And we have all sorts of the automatic escalator working through our resi space, that will happen. We've talked about now for a couple of years, as we've been changing the indices for the escalators and our resi base business to something that's more representative of the solid waste space. We've had a lot of success there. Jon's been talking about that now quarter-after-quarter, and we continue to have success. There even though CPI continued to get better. We still moved continually toward an escalator that made more sense. Recycling, we're going to -- we've got work to do still in recycling, right? It's all those things. I don't think it's any one thing that you can point to. Although, CPI by itself, if it gets north of two, two and a half will be a nice pickup for us.\nJon Ark: Yeah. There's -- two things I point to our construction, right, which certainly looks strong and it's probably gaining strength. So that could provide some upside in the large container side of the business. And we feel really optimistic about our special waste pipeline. We've always talked about an election year. Some of those jobs tend to stall out, just given the uncertainty and our pipeline remains strong through 2020, but we did see some of those jobs push out and those jobs are now hitting. So as special waste gets more busy, that should put some upward pressure on pricing on the landfill side.\nDonald Slager: Look, on top of that, you think about kind of best ever service levels, right, that speaks well for extending customer loyalty. And that means better pricing and all the rest of it. So, there's just a lot of factors.\nJon Ark: Yeah. I was going to say, the one thing to remind you of, of how CPI works through our business, is it lags, right? So the CPI print from 2020 is impacting our pricing in 2021. And even with that lower CPI based pricing, we're talking about margin expansion, strong EPS, strong cash flow growth, as well as improvements of free cash flow conversion. As we start to see inflation, right, that's only going to benefit 2022 and beyond. So, as you start to see those inflation prints, and if you see anything kind of north of two, right, because this year was only 120 basis points, anything north of two is only going to be a solid tailwind going forward.\nJeff Goldstein: That was all. Super helpful color. Thank you. Then just, you said last quarter that overtime was down 10% year-over-year, and maybe I missed it. But where does that stand right now? And do you think moving into 2021 overtime can still tick -- is it going to tick up again, given that comp or do you think you've learned how to be more efficient there?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. We're still at about the 10% range. I'd expect overtime that we'd settle into the 5% to 10% kind of a pre-pandemic, post-pandemic change or a reduction in overtime. And we'll capture some of that benefit because we've just learned how to be more efficient, right? We've taken some routes off of Saturdays and Sundays, right, and put them into our kind of daily routine Monday through Friday. And that's certainly a more efficient way to service the customer. But also keep in mind we're always looking at the income statement and the balance sheet. We're going to make the optimal trade off on the asset. And so, you could have zero time -- zero overtime by running a truck 40 hours a week. But that wouldn't be a very good capital trade-off right? So, we think in the low fifties is really the optimal spot from an hours per week where that truck should be running and that balances out customer service and safety and employee experience and all those things. So, again, we'll sustain some of those savings and overtime savings, and I think that'll settle out between a 5% to 10% reduction overtime.\nJeff Goldstein: Understood. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. In terms of pricing, all else equal and longer term, do you have a preference for a CPI based price index versus a fixed 3% increase? And I guess, more broadly if inflation does pick up generally, could you just outline what you see as the major pros and cons to your business?\nJon Ark: Yeah. I think on the pricing, I think, the first thing we want to do is we want to make sure that we secure a price increase that more than covers our costs increase. And even in a low inflationary environment, we have a strong belief that our people need to raise every year, but their expenses are going up. And so we want something that covers that cost increase and then hopefully increase a little more that allows us to expand margins over time. Our broad view is that we don't want to get too concentrated on any single indices, whether that be fixed or water through trashed or anything else. So we like a balanced approach. As long as it's something better than CPI or a fraction of CPI, which historically the industry has accepted, which we're no longer tolerating, right? We're making sure we're getting paid for the work we do over time. And then in terms of inflation, why Don mentioned that's good for us is because we've always given our people a fair wage increase, right? And so our cost increases with inflation don't really change a whole lot where we get more on the top line of the business, right, put upward pressure on our fixed -- our CPI or water, sewer trash related indices. And I think even in the open market just puts more upward pressure on pricing, on what customers are willing to pay.\nDonald Slager: Look, water, sewer trash has consistently outpaced CPI. And again, we talk about a waste related indices, it's fair. That's really the -- that's really the point, right, is in 3% to 4% fixed, it is fair. We can negotiate with customers in fairness and we can make the commitment we need to continue to update our fleet. The modernization that Jon talked about, pay our people market rates provide good benefits and do all the great things we do to keep our people showing up every day, just like they did throughout this pandemic, right? The way service providers in America didn't get near enough respect or appreciation from people at large. They showed up every day with very little complaining, and were true heroes. And to Jon's point, we are going to continue to reward that over time. And a fair rate works. And the underlying issue is really the market is rational. And it's allowing us to continue to move that needle little by little by little. And we've got a big portion of our book now corrected.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you for that. And you noted that you expect to retain efficiencies that you gained in 2020 going forward, and specifically you outlined overtime as one of those areas. What are the other cost items where you see the greatest retention of benefits that you captured during the pandemic?\nDonald Slager: Yeah. Certainly on T&E, I would say we're not the only company on that front. But there's things -- historically, most companies and we were in this bucket, they had two modes of meeting either it was a conference call or it was in-person which involved a lot of time and hotel costs and airfare costs and everything else, and the emergence of Zoom and Teams and the other technologies have allowed people to work in new ways. And there's certainly benefits from being together. And so, we expect over time, that some of those costs will come back from the business, but certainly not all those costs. So we're challenging the way we work. And the other thing, over time will be real estate. There are some roles that we think will be better permanently done from home. We did an unbelievable job of transitioning our team from an in-office environment, primarily to an at-home environment. And some of those roles, we think long-term are best suited to be at-home and we'll have some real estate savings associated with that.\nJon Ark: Things like that will affect turnover continually positively right? So we've seen good benefits from that. So it's a number -- again, a number of things, but a lot of sustainability there.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And as Jon mentioned earlier, the benefits from routing that impacts more than just labor, that also impacts maintenance and fuel. And if you look at our results, right, you can see the improvements that we're seeing in that cost as a percentage of revenue across all of those P&L line item.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, gang. Thanks for the questions. If I'm playing clean up, Brian, can I ask you a couple of housekeeping? So we all hear the same message. Like what's the share count in the earnings guidance, what's your run rate interest expense per quarter. So we get those right in our model.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Michael, what like you said, we're not going into that level of detail on the guide. Again, I think just, keeping it to the EPS and the free cash flow and some of the organic growth is where we're keeping that, as compared to going through some of the individual components. That said, I mentioned on the -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are assuming that 26% equivalent tax rate, that's that combination of both the effective tax rate as well as the non-cash charges from solar investments. But again, we're kind of keeping it a little bit more to a higher level guide.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. But are you assuming share buybacks in that number? Or should we -- I mean, it does matter because it could be a 2% or 3% movement.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. We've got a modest amount of share purchases. Again, as we've talked about previously the first use of that free cash flow is going to be for acquisitions. We talked about that robust pipeline of acquisition activity. So, again, that's going to be the first use, is going to be to fund that. So, it's not going to be necessarily, I would say, as significant as what you've seen in years prior to 2020, but still a modest amount of share repurchases assumed in 2021.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. On the margin, just for clarity, your original guidance was midpoint was 28.5. Do you beat that by 90 basis points? Which I presume what's happened is there's nothing like a crisis to get you all focused on a cost structure that was coming out of the model regardless, but it's now come all out in 2020, you're going to carry and hold it, keep it and build from it. Is the right way to read all this?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Correct.\nJon Ark: Yeah. I'd say the one exception of, Michael, look, there is a little bit of tailwind benefit here on the safety side and on the productivity side with lower traffic patterns. And as people return to the office, right, when -- to what pace that happens, we'll see, right? There may be some headwind, but I think that's the minor part of the story, right? I think the majority of those safety productivity benefits, right, we plan on capturing, because success begets success, right? We figured out a new way of working in those teams. And those -- our teams are committed to capturing those benefits.\nDonald Slager: You think about -- to your point, Michael, we were -- when we moved originally from answering the phone at 300 locations to three, we said, Hey, someday, we're going to think about work from home solution, but that wasn't in our mind to do in 2020 until it had to be, right? We were -- that was sort of in our mind a couple of years out, right? There'll be other things we're working on. And then all of a sudden it had to happen. And as we reported, we moved to working from home in those three locations with like 72 hours. And that was a great learning. It was a great find. It was a great pickup. Now we'll benefit from that going forward, right? We'll figure out what that all means. As Jon said, as things sort of modulating, and we find this new-- this next new plateau, if you will, and then we'll grow from there and from there, right? But yeah, we did better than we originally thought. And the story continues to improve from here. As I mentioned, there's still a lot of upside in this business. Jon talked about RISE, talk about all these other things that we're doing that are still in early innings that are continued to pay benefits into the future.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And Mike, I mentioned it earlier. I think it was Tyler's question, right? So, back to on the heels -- and I think you were just asking this question -- on the heels of that triple digit margin expansion in 2020, right, we expect further margin expansion. Within the guide there, there's 50 basis points of margin expansion with -- from the underlying business in 2021. And then there's a couple of pieces that are somewhat offsetting that, but very strong performance, especially given what we did this year\nJon Ark: Think about RISE, I mean, we started to roll that out and then COVID hit, and then we pumped the brakes and then we kind of went full up, right? And we continue to implement that. I mean, the team that did that, did an outstanding job, we thought sort of spring last year that we'd have to, I'd say pull the plug on it, but just really put it aside while we were dealing with the uncertainty of COVID. Instead, we move forward. We actually increased the speed and actually got it. That phase of it all implemented and pretty impressive.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it. Last one for me. You did $128 million in 2020 in the environmental solutions business. Is that -- you've confused me with your answers, that number going to be up or down in 2021?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: It's going to somewhat flattish is what we are expecting on the environmental solutions.\nDonald Slager: Yeah.\nMichael Hoffman: Which is pretty significant since you're running $25 million a quarter for three quarters. So you've got to overcome a really tough 1Q to be flat. So that's the importance of that statement.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Cool. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks so much for taking the questions. First of all, congratulations to your entire team from the frontline folks on up for the performance in a really tough year again. I guess, I have a little bit of a long-term or even the medium term growth strategy question here, which is, I think we understand that there's always a component of churn that is structural and driven by bankruptcies. I think, if you said back in April that you'd be exiting the year at a 93% retention rate, we would have been surprised. It's interesting now commercial bankruptcies are actually down year-over-year in the U.S. and still just listening to what you've said about your own cost structure. I mean, if more companies act like Republic and continue to not spend on hospitality, travel and some of the other expense in the past, where business formation and where growth happens in the economy is still going to change from what we might have expected previously. So how do you calibrate for that? How do you position the business to capture where the growth is going to be?\nDonald Slager: Overall, think about where we are, right? And think about the balance we have. We always talk about the power of the portfolio, right? That is number one. And number two, across the markets we're in. We have a good concentration in what I've called Sunbelt markets, but markets and people move to whether it's the Northwest, down the West Coast, across the South and up into the Carolinas, we're well-positioned in places like Texas and Florida, right? A lot of people moving there these days. So, we're still got strong positions in Metro markets, right? This thing's going to settle down. People are going to become more rational in their behavior again. And well-positioned to pick up all the growth in the markets we're in. So, that -- the way that growth comes will change. Downturns and these kind of shocks to the economy that we've lived through we know for our entire lives here and there, are different. This one's different than the last one. So there's still strong demand for housing, right? And we've always talked about how single family home, housing starts and household formation clearly tracks with our growth. So that paints a pretty strong picture. Household formation lends to business formation. There's a lot, I think, pent-up demand and the consumer, consumers are pretty good shape, right? When you think about wage growth and think about what's happened in savings accounts across the nation, I think there's a lot of people just chomping at the bit to get out. And so, while we may have pulled in a little bit on teeny, the average consumer is going through, I think, they're going to get out there and rush to some new opportunity, right?\nNoah Kaye: Yeah.\nDonald Slager: And so we're not too concerned and -- about that. I think the free market always finds a way and we're right smack dab in the middle of the free market, right?\nNoah Kaye: Yeah. I mean, the household balance sheets are in great shape as you point out relative to past crises. And you mentioned the housing sector activity plus potential RISE and CPI, plus a full year of reopening. And then that will point to kind of a multiyear growth acceleration for the waste industry. So, I think, your comments around the portfolio and how you can leverage off of that are well taken.\nDonald Slager: Look, the other thing too is like, when we went through the Great Recession, right, that thing was -- pardon the term, but that's by a thousand cuts. I mean, it just kept going and getting deeper and longer and sustained. And is this thing ever going to get over? There's probably some people that have some of that feeling about COVID, but we went from -- Hey, surprise. COVID is here to the bottom falling out across the market, defining that bottom, in a pretty short order and then battling back. It wasn't this ongoing three, four year slump of this. We're coming out of it, right? And there are still people who are dealing with tragedy, there are people dealing with hardship, and we're not minimizing any of that. But all -- all-in-all over the top of it, the economy is coming out of it and we're coming out of it with it. And we're seeing those things reflect in our business. And so, that's our viewpoint for 2021 and beyond.\nNoah Kaye: Great. Well, thanks again for taking the question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Nice work. Really, really good work.\nDonald Slager: Hi, Sean.\nSean Eastman: It's getting long. So, I'll just ask one. I'm just curious, if you look at your private competitors or maybe if you looked at your acquisition pipeline -- the companies in your acquisition pipeline. I mean, it sounds like the pricing discipline goes all the way down to the small independents, which is great. I\u2019m just curious, if you look at this ability RSGs had to dynamically flex costs and really having on an offense on some of these technology initiatives in 2020. Has it been similar with those private companies? I mean, have you observed a similar approach from them through this last year or not? I'd be curious to get your sense on that.\nDonald Slager: I think it\u2019s a mix, to be honest. I think some people panic frankly and did mass layoffs really quickly. Other people kind of plow their way through. I think the broader theme is they\u2019re not making some of the investments we\u2019re making into sustainability, for example, or into the digital platform that we\u2019re making. These are multiyear investments. And these are eight figure investments over time that become really, really expensive that we need broad scale to get value out of investments over time. So, we see them. Again, I think, pricing has held up well. I think, in general, people have tried to do the right thing in terms of taking care of their people on balance. But we\u2019ve been able to kind of do both where they -- we\u2019ve seen that more just focus on getting the garbage or the recycling off the ground rather than thinking longer term about where to take their business.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And look at our CapEx, right? I mean, we didn\u2019t take a CapEx holiday in 2020, right? We didn\u2019t hit that free cash flow number by not spending on the company. We continue our investments in fleet and systems and some of the innovations that Jon talked about. Of course, we invested heavily in our frontline, in our people. We\u2019re committed to serve. And we saw some of that from some of our smaller providers. As Jon said, it\u2019s a mixed bag, I mean, overall, I think it depends how healthy and strong you are going into it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we were coming into this from a position of strength and stability and alignment across our team and a really strong culture going in and that led the way for us. And again, back to the power of the portfolio, we\u2019re well-positioned, good balance sheet, all those things in our favor. So, position of strength matters, and from there, now we'll get back to 2021 and we'll do it again.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Yee: Hi. Good evening. I'll just ask one question. Do you envision Republic getting to 30% EBITDA margins? And can you talk about what drivers will get you there as you have to offset some of the headwinds when business activity picks up? Is there a timeframe that you have in mind for reaching that target?\nDonald Slager: Well, we're right on the cusp of 30% EBITDA margins and 29.5% our guide. We think, yes, we will certainly be at 30%. What are some of the drivers? As we continue to improve our recycling business, we are well into that. We can give you more detail, but we are running out of time on the call today. But we\u2019ve made good progress there, good progress on -- as Jon mentioned the approach we\u2019re taking on the alternative indices in the resi space, good progress there. The RISE platform while we've guided rolled out. It\u2019s only sort of the early phases of that, that is going to be something that we\u2019ll build on once we get connected digitally the customers and all the parts of our business, we will just continue to add enhancements that drive margin, that drive quality -- customer experience that drive customer loyalty, will drive price, right? The safety story is a good story. Fleet is a good story. And then M&A, right? As we build, we\u2019re going to do a nice balance of new platform acquisitions, new markets, but also our bread and butter is still tuck-ins in markets we\u2019re already in. Come in at a higher margin, they are quicker to integrate. So there is just a handful of things that are in our favor. And we'll continue to invest properly in the business. We told you we had 30% in our sites as we are right there, and 30% margin will be here before you know it. How\u2019s that?\nStephanie Yee: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Feniger: Hey, guys. Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. And just on the 1.5% to 2% volume and the fact that Q1 is going to be slightly negative. Can you just help us understand how that\u2019s going to play out through the year? I mean, do we need a pickup in some commercial and some business units in the second half to get us to that 1.5% to 2%?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. So, Mike, let me take this one. So, again, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we're expecting the performance to be better than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year, but still negative, right? As we look at the kind of the distribution of volume, we would expect our best volume performance to be in the second quarter and that\u2019s just because of the comp, right? So that\u2019s when we saw the biggest decline in 2020. So, you\u2019ve got the easiest prior year comparison. And then it gets a little bit tougher as you move into the second half, but our expectation is that, it still remains positive. So, again, we are projecting that the economy continues to gradually improve and that is baked into our guide on the top line. But as you kind of said meaningful type volume recovery to get there, I'd say, no. Most of that has already occurred based on what we\u2019ve seen in 2020, with some modest improvement going forward in unit recovery.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks. Thanks, Brian. And just, I know this has been asked before, the $600 million spend, which does not include Santek, it\u2019s translating to 150 bps of the top line. I mean, you guys just did over $10 billion of sales. I'm just trying to translate the $600 million, the 150 bps top line. And I know you are not going to give us acquisition multiples, I get that. Maybe I\u2019m just a little slow here just like getting that $600 million spend, the 150 bps, is that like just very conservative? Are they are like on divestitures? I'm just trying to triangulate some of that.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Yeah. So, let me clarify. Okay?\nMichael Feniger: Yeah.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: The 150 basis points is the rollover impact of acquisitions that closed during 2020. That includes acquisitions that closed in February of 2020. And that\u2019s nothing to do with Santek. Santek did not close by December 31. It is not in that 150 basis points. Based on the timing of when it closed in 2020, you get a rollover benefit, just because you didn\u2019t report a full year in 2020, that\u2019s the 150 basis points. If you were to just annualize the revenue of what we acquired in 2020, it\u2019s over $200 million.\nMichael Feniger: Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Yeah. Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: As we look forward, though, into 2021, our $600 million investment that we\u2019re anticipating, that does include Santek as well as other deals. We are not talking about right now about the revenue contribution that we are anticipating from those deals, because some of it\u2019s just based on when it closes in 2021, how much it will contribute in here.\nMichael Feniger: That was helpful. Thank you, Brian. I appreciate that. Thanks. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Next question comes from Scott Levine with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.\nScott Levine: Hey guys.\nDonaldSlager: Hi, Scott.\nScott Levine: I have one question for you, actually on recycling. So, we've seen commodity prices come back very nicely. China has essentially pulled back from the market. Even though we are at a lower price point on most recycled commodities than we were in say 2017. Does the new environment gives you -- being more stable give you more confident in investing in recycling? Or what are your expectations now that kind of the whole China import ban scenario has kind of played itself out in commodity prices are on meant there?\nDonald Slager: Yeah. There are two things. One, is certainly even strengthens our result to go into City Hall and get a pricing mechanism that we think works for both parties. Historically, the industry is price recycling on the backend, which has caused a lot of volatility in the business, that is otherwise quite stable. And we think the fairest pricing model that we get paid a fair return to pick it up, a fair return to process it. And then we share in the commodity value in the backend. And as commodity prices get higher, it\u2019s easier to talk to customers, particularly in municipalities about getting that model, right? And then long-term, we are bullish on recycling. We see a world that has population growth and material scarcity and a big desire from a lot of different aspects around reuse and recycle. And we think we are going to be a big part of that and a big player in that. We just have to make sure that to be environmentally sustainable, it is economically sustainable and we get a fair return for the work that we do.\nScott Levine: Fair enough. Thanks. I will leave it there. Nice work guys.\nJon Ark: Thank you.\nDonald Slager: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nDonald Slager: Great. Thank you, operator. When we look back on 2020, it's clear to see just how instrumental the foundation we\u2019ve built over the past decade has been and enabling us to thrive in the midst of so many challenges. The pandemic's impact on Republic was just like that of the rest of the world, disrupting the lives of our customers, our communities and, of course, our people. But we were able to react from a position of strength, taking care of all of our stakeholders. Our strong foundation did more than just set us apart, it actually allowed us to prevail. We believe our 2020 performance clearly demonstrated the resiliency of our business, and position just well to deliver continued growth in 2021. This momentum is bolstered by an improving economy, as we move into an era of recovery and growth. As always, we managed this business to create long-term value for all our stakeholders while providing essential sustainable services for our customers. I thank the team for their tenacity and their enthusiasm, as we head into this New Year. Thanks for joining us. Hope you all have a good evening and stay safe out there.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Donald Slager",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication, and commitment, we delivered record setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high-end of the original guidance we provided last February. During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year, generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow, even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes, expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%, improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%, increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%, and achieved record setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our number one strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record-setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provides the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call. Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll-off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to, again, thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of the pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year. With that, let me turn the call over to Jon. Sure. Hamzah, thanks for the question. Yeah. We're feeling really good about the trends we're seeing. You mentioned service decreases -- increases. We continue to see more increases than decreases. We're seeing the business come back. We're seeing people get back to work. We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing. I mentioned the pipeline being strong, so we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked -- as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in 2020, we expect to hold on to. But looking at pricing, pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market's coming back and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it, as we go through time, but that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as alongside of it. And then I think, there's a little bit talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business, a little inflation will help CPI pickup. So, we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business. Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here at 2021 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now. And it's just a matter of pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year. But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think. Hi, Tyler. And then underlying -- or the headline story is -- 30% is right there in our sites, Tyler. Yeah. We've gotten over a hundred customers to amend the terms primarily on municipal residential contracts, because weights have increased. Now in April and the immediacy of the shock when everyone was sheltering in place, weights were up about 10%. That's modulating to be down to 5%. But then that's still -- in those contracts with those are time and weight-based contracts. And so as we get heavy, we need a price for that. As that number dissipates and there's some modulators people get back to work, those -- more of those pricing renewals will come in the normal cycle of price -- a contract changes versus out of cycle contract changes. But that is not a high margin part of the business for us and all the players in the industry. So, we absolutely have to get paid for the work we do there. Sure. Yeah. Listen, we think electrification is exciting technology for a couple of reasons. One, it's truly the only zero-based emission technology out there. CNG is incrementally better than diesel, but only incrementally a better than that. So, it's the right technology long-term. And our application tends to be a perfect one for electrification, because range anxiety is a big issue in trucking for electrification. And we don't have that as our trucks come home to the same location every night and you can get into overnight charging. So, we're really excited about the technology. And we're going to get there. We've always said there's going to be multiple paths to get there, and there's going to be some uncertainty. The destination is clear. The path to get there has some uncertainty. So, we've got a number of different relationships going on, pilots with multiple manufacturers. We talked about the Romeo investment. And in terms of the specific, partnership that we exited, right, disappointing for us, but that didn't cost us anything. That contract was very intentionally designed. It was performance based and the extent they couldn't execute against the performance. It costs us nothing on that front. So, disappointing again, because we're cheering for everybody to get there because we think it's good for the planet. But we are confident that we've got the right set of partners and we're going to be excited -- update you on our progress as we move forward. Thank you. Yeah. The pipeline remains strong and it remains balanced. Balanced across kind of core markets we're in the recycling and solid waste space. And obviously that's the bread and butter of our acquisition strategy. And those tuck-ins are highly creative. We're also looking at new geographies and have gotten into different -- spend the geographies in the last two to three years, which again provides new growth opportunities. And then also new parts of the business. So, we mentioned environmental solutions, and those are actually core customers of ours. We've done -- work for them for a long period of time. It's really expanding our product line into those customers, because they've asked us to do it. They want a provider who can provide digital solutions, who's got a great track record on safety and sustainability. And we're finding it attractive to expand our product set through acquisitions there as well. Well, I would say one, we are weathering the pandemic and feel hopeful that we'll be on the other side of this thing before too long. So, as relates to leverage, we've always stated what our optimal leverage is. And we've been for the last couple of years and kind of keeping right in that three times, the good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow, and even increase the overall debt level, but keep your leverage pretty, pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right? So, we are -- we have in the past for the right deal increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 to 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to overlap with the company by any means, but we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done, getting deals through DOJ, accordingly getting assets sold as necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that and proven capability within our team. So, yeah, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change a regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling. A lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time and they start to think about selling their businesses, their retirement. So, we're right there to pick them up. Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position, but with the appetite to move into that number one or number two spot before too long, and that's still our approach. So, the pipeline is strong, the ability to get deals done, and integrate deals are strong and the balance sheet is strong. So we can't be in a better place. Yeah. Let me start with the second part and I'll work back to the first part of. The -- so yes, lots of work in Europe and everywhere else. Listen, innovation is going to have lots of people looking at lots of different things over time. If you look at where the balance of the global OEMs are, the investment on electrification in our space is dwarfing. The investment on hydrogen, most of our hydrogen investment has really been in the long haul space. And look, if we remain open-minded, right, as the technologies emerge and evolve, but I think it's -- we're pretty competent. Electrification is going to be the right technology for our application. And then we're working through the alliance with Romeo. We're -- they're not going to become an exclusive supplier to us by any means that wasn't the nature of the relationship and deal. However, we are working on proprietary things together and including a pilot where we retrofit one of our vehicles, because that's what the electrification to get it to scale. It's going to take a commitment and willingness to innovate, right? Trial and error, learning, testing, right? We'll adjust and over time, right, we'll kind of overcome those hurdles, and we will get to scale with the technology. Thanks. Yeah. Sure. So we started with our dispatch function. And so -- from the operation side, and that's where -- that's the team that really builds routes and directs the trucks out every morning and adjust those trucks sometimes in the middle of the day, so that we can service our customers. And we got them into a very visual based mapping structure that allows us to build routes more efficiently and frankly more effectively for customers to improve our delivery time and speed.  We're now in the process of rolling out technology into all of our vehicles. And so, now we'll have two way communication between dispatch and the vehicle. And we think that as a number of benefits. One, it allows us to provide a better employee experience. It certainly allows us to take more costs out of the system, because we're more efficient. And then it'll also allow us to connect to all of the customer facing investments we've made over time that allow us to provide service notification, verification and reporting, and a number of the benefits that customers want, which we think will help further differentiate our offering in the marketplace. Well, it's all the above, right? There's a lot of mix issues that go into yield. Certainly, it is. CPI has an impact on our business as CPI moves up. And we have all sorts of the automatic escalator working through our resi space, that will happen. We've talked about now for a couple of years, as we've been changing the indices for the escalators and our resi base business to something that's more representative of the solid waste space. We've had a lot of success there. Jon's been talking about that now quarter-after-quarter, and we continue to have success. There even though CPI continued to get better. We still moved continually toward an escalator that made more sense. Recycling, we're going to -- we've got work to do still in recycling, right? It's all those things. I don't think it's any one thing that you can point to. Although, CPI by itself, if it gets north of two, two and a half will be a nice pickup for us. Look, on top of that, you think about kind of best ever service levels, right, that speaks well for extending customer loyalty. And that means better pricing and all the rest of it. So, there's just a lot of factors. Look, water, sewer trash has consistently outpaced CPI. And again, we talk about a waste related indices, it's fair. That's really the -- that's really the point, right, is in 3% to 4% fixed, it is fair. We can negotiate with customers in fairness and we can make the commitment we need to continue to update our fleet. The modernization that Jon talked about, pay our people market rates provide good benefits and do all the great things we do to keep our people showing up every day, just like they did throughout this pandemic, right? The way service providers in America didn't get near enough respect or appreciation from people at large. They showed up every day with very little complaining, and were true heroes. And to Jon's point, we are going to continue to reward that over time. And a fair rate works. And the underlying issue is really the market is rational. And it's allowing us to continue to move that needle little by little by little. And we've got a big portion of our book now corrected. Yeah. Certainly on T&E, I would say we're not the only company on that front. But there's things -- historically, most companies and we were in this bucket, they had two modes of meeting either it was a conference call or it was in-person which involved a lot of time and hotel costs and airfare costs and everything else, and the emergence of Zoom and Teams and the other technologies have allowed people to work in new ways. And there's certainly benefits from being together. And so, we expect over time, that some of those costs will come back from the business, but certainly not all those costs. So we're challenging the way we work. And the other thing, over time will be real estate. There are some roles that we think will be better permanently done from home. We did an unbelievable job of transitioning our team from an in-office environment, primarily to an at-home environment. And some of those roles, we think long-term are best suited to be at-home and we'll have some real estate savings associated with that. You think about -- to your point, Michael, we were -- when we moved originally from answering the phone at 300 locations to three, we said, Hey, someday, we're going to think about work from home solution, but that wasn't in our mind to do in 2020 until it had to be, right? We were -- that was sort of in our mind a couple of years out, right? There'll be other things we're working on. And then all of a sudden it had to happen. And as we reported, we moved to working from home in those three locations with like 72 hours. And that was a great learning. It was a great find. It was a great pickup. Now we'll benefit from that going forward, right? We'll figure out what that all means. As Jon said, as things sort of modulating, and we find this new-- this next new plateau, if you will, and then we'll grow from there and from there, right? But yeah, we did better than we originally thought. And the story continues to improve from here. As I mentioned, there's still a lot of upside in this business. Jon talked about RISE, talk about all these other things that we're doing that are still in early innings that are continued to pay benefits into the future. Yeah. Overall, think about where we are, right? And think about the balance we have. We always talk about the power of the portfolio, right? That is number one. And number two, across the markets we're in. We have a good concentration in what I've called Sunbelt markets, but markets and people move to whether it's the Northwest, down the West Coast, across the South and up into the Carolinas, we're well-positioned in places like Texas and Florida, right? A lot of people moving there these days. So, we're still got strong positions in Metro markets, right? This thing's going to settle down. People are going to become more rational in their behavior again. And well-positioned to pick up all the growth in the markets we're in. So, that -- the way that growth comes will change. Downturns and these kind of shocks to the economy that we've lived through we know for our entire lives here and there, are different. This one's different than the last one. So there's still strong demand for housing, right? And we've always talked about how single family home, housing starts and household formation clearly tracks with our growth. So that paints a pretty strong picture. Household formation lends to business formation. There's a lot, I think, pent-up demand and the consumer, consumers are pretty good shape, right? When you think about wage growth and think about what's happened in savings accounts across the nation, I think there's a lot of people just chomping at the bit to get out. And so, while we may have pulled in a little bit on teeny, the average consumer is going through, I think, they're going to get out there and rush to some new opportunity, right? And so we're not too concerned and -- about that. I think the free market always finds a way and we're right smack dab in the middle of the free market, right? Look, the other thing too is like, when we went through the Great Recession, right, that thing was -- pardon the term, but that's by a thousand cuts. I mean, it just kept going and getting deeper and longer and sustained. And is this thing ever going to get over? There's probably some people that have some of that feeling about COVID, but we went from -- Hey, surprise. COVID is here to the bottom falling out across the market, defining that bottom, in a pretty short order and then battling back. It wasn't this ongoing three, four year slump of this. We're coming out of it, right? And there are still people who are dealing with tragedy, there are people dealing with hardship, and we're not minimizing any of that. But all -- all-in-all over the top of it, the economy is coming out of it and we're coming out of it with it. And we're seeing those things reflect in our business. And so, that's our viewpoint for 2021 and beyond. Hi, Sean. I think it's a mix, to be honest. I think some people panic frankly and did mass layoffs really quickly. Other people kind of plow their way through. I think the broader theme is they're not making some of the investments we're making into sustainability, for example, or into the digital platform that we're making. These are multiyear investments. And these are eight figure investments over time that become really, really expensive that we need broad scale to get value out of investments over time. So, we see them. Again, I think, pricing has held up well. I think, in general, people have tried to do the right thing in terms of taking care of their people on balance. But we've been able to kind of do both where they -- we've seen that more just focus on getting the garbage or the recycling off the ground rather than thinking longer term about where to take their business. Well, we're right on the cusp of 30% EBITDA margins and 29.5% our guide. We think, yes, we will certainly be at 30%. What are some of the drivers? As we continue to improve our recycling business, we are well into that. We can give you more detail, but we are running out of time on the call today. But we've made good progress there, good progress on -- as Jon mentioned the approach we're taking on the alternative indices in the resi space, good progress there. The RISE platform while we've guided rolled out. It's only sort of the early phases of that, that is going to be something that we'll build on once we get connected digitally the customers and all the parts of our business, we will just continue to add enhancements that drive margin, that drive quality -- customer experience that drive customer loyalty, will drive price, right? The safety story is a good story. Fleet is a good story. And then M&A, right? As we build, we're going to do a nice balance of new platform acquisitions, new markets, but also our bread and butter is still tuck-ins in markets we're already in. Come in at a higher margin, they are quicker to integrate. So there is just a handful of things that are in our favor. And we'll continue to invest properly in the business. We told you we had 30% in our sites as we are right there, and 30% margin will be here before you know it. How's that? Hi, Scott. Yeah. There are two things. One, is certainly even strengthens our result to go into City Hall and get a pricing mechanism that we think works for both parties. Historically, the industry is price recycling on the backend, which has caused a lot of volatility in the business, that is otherwise quite stable. And we think the fairest pricing model that we get paid a fair return to pick it up, a fair return to process it. And then we share in the commodity value in the backend. And as commodity prices get higher, it's easier to talk to customers, particularly in municipalities about getting that model, right? And then long-term, we are bullish on recycling. We see a world that has population growth and material scarcity and a big desire from a lot of different aspects around reuse and recycle. And we think we are going to be a big part of that and a big player in that. We just have to make sure that to be environmentally sustainable, it is economically sustainable and we get a fair return for the work that we do. Thanks, Scott. Great. Thank you, operator. When we look back on 2020, it's clear to see just how instrumental the foundation we've built over the past decade has been and enabling us to thrive in the midst of so many challenges. The pandemic's impact on Republic was just like that of the rest of the world, disrupting the lives of our customers, our communities and, of course, our people. But we were able to react from a position of strength, taking care of all of our stakeholders. Our strong foundation did more than just set us apart, it actually allowed us to prevail. We believe our 2020 performance clearly demonstrated the resiliency of our business, and position just well to deliver continued growth in 2021. This momentum is bolstered by an improving economy, as we move into an era of recovery and growth. As always, we managed this business to create long-term value for all our stakeholders while providing essential sustainable services for our customers. I thank the team for their tenacity and their enthusiasm, as we head into this New Year. Thanks for joining us. Hope you all have a good evening and stay safe out there."

            "name": "Jon Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Don. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years. Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yield to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021. During the fourth quarter volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels. Fourth quarter small container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130-basis-point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to the volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021. Next turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90-basis-point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in in-plant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above average growth rates. We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions, and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 67% to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to $66 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume. Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience. I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021. Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society, while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long-term. As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future. In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond. Our sustainability performance continues to be well-regarded, as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones sustainability World and North America indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time.  I will now turn the call over to Brian. Good afternoon. Yeah. look, we have -- we're probably six or seven quarters into a substantial step up in landfill average yield, right. Over 3.2% for the quarter and we expect it to be strong again in 2021. And to your point, a chunk of that volume is certainly tied to contracted business and tied to some inflation-based index. So, as CPI goes up, we get inflation, that should put upward pressure on it. But I also just think people have realized landfills are expensive to operate. And so, we need to price for the investments we make into those assets, and that's put upward pressure on MSW price or landfill pricing more broadly again across the last couple of years, and I don't see that trend abating at all. Yeah. There's -- two things I point to our construction, right, which certainly looks strong and it's probably gaining strength. So that could provide some upside in the large container side of the business. And we feel really optimistic about our special waste pipeline. We've always talked about an election year. Some of those jobs tend to stall out, just given the uncertainty and our pipeline remains strong through 2020, but we did see some of those jobs push out and those jobs are now hitting. So as special waste gets more busy, that should put some upward pressure on pricing on the landfill side. Yeah. I was going to say, the one thing to remind you of, of how CPI works through our business, is it lags, right? So the CPI print from 2020 is impacting our pricing in 2021. And even with that lower CPI based pricing, we're talking about margin expansion, strong EPS, strong cash flow growth, as well as improvements of free cash flow conversion. As we start to see inflation, right, that's only going to benefit 2022 and beyond. So, as you start to see those inflation prints, and if you see anything kind of north of two, right, because this year was only 120 basis points, anything north of two is only going to be a solid tailwind going forward. Yeah. I think on the pricing, I think, the first thing we want to do is we want to make sure that we secure a price increase that more than covers our costs increase. And even in a low inflationary environment, we have a strong belief that our people need to raise every year, but their expenses are going up. And so we want something that covers that cost increase and then hopefully increase a little more that allows us to expand margins over time. Our broad view is that we don't want to get too concentrated on any single indices, whether that be fixed or water through trashed or anything else. So we like a balanced approach. As long as it's something better than CPI or a fraction of CPI, which historically the industry has accepted, which we're no longer tolerating, right? We're making sure we're getting paid for the work we do over time. And then in terms of inflation, why Don mentioned that's good for us is because we've always given our people a fair wage increase, right? And so our cost increases with inflation don't really change a whole lot where we get more on the top line of the business, right, put upward pressure on our fixed -- our CPI or water, sewer trash related indices. And I think even in the open market just puts more upward pressure on pricing, on what customers are willing to pay. Things like that will affect turnover continually positively right? So we've seen good benefits from that. So it's a number -- again, a number of things, but a lot of sustainability there. Yeah. I'd say the one exception of, Michael, look, there is a little bit of tailwind benefit here on the safety side and on the productivity side with lower traffic patterns. And as people return to the office, right, when -- to what pace that happens, we'll see, right? There may be some headwind, but I think that's the minor part of the story, right? I think the majority of those safety productivity benefits, right, we plan on capturing, because success begets success, right? We figured out a new way of working in those teams. And those -- our teams are committed to capturing those benefits. Think about RISE, I mean, we started to roll that out and then COVID hit, and then we pumped the brakes and then we kind of went full up, right? And we continue to implement that. I mean, the team that did that, did an outstanding job, we thought sort of spring last year that we'd have to, I'd say pull the plug on it, but just really put it aside while we were dealing with the uncertainty of COVID. Instead, we move forward. We actually increased the speed and actually got it. That phase of it all implemented and pretty impressive. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1. This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was $0.16 above the high-end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 from this resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs, while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsize margin expansion is a direct result of pricing and excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working in utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile. We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased $62 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital. Working capital included a one and a half day improvement in DSO and a two and a half day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes. Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid 40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially, but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison. During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately $60 million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1 times. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately 16% for the year. When you further consider non-cash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021, made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of non-cash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single digit to low double-digit growth. With that operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Yeah. From a top line perspective, Tyler, we've got about 150 basis points of top line rollover in the guide. But that's just what's actually closed through the end of 2020. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'll give you the puts and takes there in a second, but just kind of to further Don's comment, one of the things I think you have to appreciate is when you take a look at our 2020 performance, we're coming off of triple digit margin expansion, which I think really differentiates us from our peers, and we're talking about furthering its margin expansion from here, and we don't think we're done after we get through 2021. But if you take a look at the puts and takes what's underlying that 29.5%, we're looking at underlying expansion of call it somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we've kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together to your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those two is about a 20-basis-point headwind to margin. And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year one. That's predominantly just from the integration and the transaction in the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So, while it's diluted in year one, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year two and beyond. Yeah. Core expansion of 50 basis points. And again, that's the -- really the important story here is that's on the heels of really strong margin expansion in 2020. Kyle, I think if you actually take a look at the overall average yield performance, you've seen in that residential business, 3% plus pricing the last two quarters, and that's where you're going to see as we renegotiate and change the structure of those contracts, that's where you're going to see it. Thanks. Yeah. So, let me just start with some of the numbers that you asked on the rollover. So, the rollover, right, by definition is that, which is closed in 2020, again, that's about 150 basis points.  Okay. So, again, the actual revenue contribution from the $600 million will be -- which of the deals that we intend to close in 2021, that'll be based on the timing of when they close. So, again, we're guiding on the top line organic growth, which is that combination of yield and volume, how much revenue we get in 2021, again, on the $600 million, we'll be more timing based than anything else. Yeah. The comment was a little bit more, I would say, on the top line as it relates. And again, back to the commentary was really that focused on the downstream portion of that business. So, again, as Jon mentioned, that's an area where we really feel like we can leverage our core capabilities. It's what we do already. So it's really just expanding that addressable market to those customers that are really looking for an integrated solution and really from a provider of someone like us. So, that's where we just feel like a combination of both organic growth opportunities, as well as through acquisition that we can see above average growth rates relative to what we may see on the solid waste side expressed as a percentage. Yeah. So, you're correct. Right, the 150 basis points that only includes acquisitions, which have closed. So that specifically exclude Santek. And we're not giving any sort of details on what we pay for Santek or for that matter any other deals. Yeah. We're still at about the 10% range. I'd expect overtime that we'd settle into the 5% to 10% kind of a pre-pandemic, post-pandemic change or a reduction in overtime. And we'll capture some of that benefit because we've just learned how to be more efficient, right? We've taken some routes off of Saturdays and Sundays, right, and put them into our kind of daily routine Monday through Friday. And that's certainly a more efficient way to service the customer. But also keep in mind we're always looking at the income statement and the balance sheet. We're going to make the optimal trade off on the asset. And so, you could have zero time -- zero overtime by running a truck 40 hours a week. But that wouldn't be a very good capital trade-off right? So, we think in the low fifties is really the optimal spot from an hours per week where that truck should be running and that balances out customer service and safety and employee experience and all those things. So, again, we'll sustain some of those savings and overtime savings, and I think that'll settle out between a 5% to 10% reduction overtime. And as Jon mentioned earlier, the benefits from routing that impacts more than just labor, that also impacts maintenance and fuel. And if you look at our results, right, you can see the improvements that we're seeing in that cost as a percentage of revenue across all of those P&L line item. Yeah. Michael, what like you said, we're not going into that level of detail on the guide. Again, I think just, keeping it to the EPS and the free cash flow and some of the organic growth is where we're keeping that, as compared to going through some of the individual components. That said, I mentioned on the -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are assuming that 26% equivalent tax rate, that's that combination of both the effective tax rate as well as the non-cash charges from solar investments. But again, we're kind of keeping it a little bit more to a higher level guide. Yeah. We've got a modest amount of share purchases. Again, as we've talked about previously the first use of that free cash flow is going to be for acquisitions. We talked about that robust pipeline of acquisition activity. So, again, that's going to be the first use, is going to be to fund that. So, it's not going to be necessarily, I would say, as significant as what you've seen in years prior to 2020, but still a modest amount of share repurchases assumed in 2021. Correct. And Mike, I mentioned it earlier. I think it was Tyler's question, right? So, back to on the heels -- and I think you were just asking this question -- on the heels of that triple digit margin expansion in 2020, right, we expect further margin expansion. Within the guide there, there's 50 basis points of margin expansion with -- from the underlying business in 2021. And then there's a couple of pieces that are somewhat offsetting that, but very strong performance, especially given what we did this year It's going to somewhat flattish is what we are expecting on the environmental solutions. Yeah. And look at our CapEx, right? I mean, we didn't take a CapEx holiday in 2020, right? We didn't hit that free cash flow number by not spending on the company. We continue our investments in fleet and systems and some of the innovations that Jon talked about. Of course, we invested heavily in our frontline, in our people. We're committed to serve. And we saw some of that from some of our smaller providers. As Jon said, it's a mixed bag, I mean, overall, I think it depends how healthy and strong you are going into it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we were coming into this from a position of strength and stability and alignment across our team and a really strong culture going in and that led the way for us. And again, back to the power of the portfolio, we're well-positioned, good balance sheet, all those things in our favor. So, position of strength matters, and from there, now we'll get back to 2021 and we'll do it again. Yeah. So, Mike, let me take this one. So, again, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we're expecting the performance to be better than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year, but still negative, right? As we look at the kind of the distribution of volume, we would expect our best volume performance to be in the second quarter and that's just because of the comp, right? So that's when we saw the biggest decline in 2020. So, you've got the easiest prior year comparison. And then it gets a little bit tougher as you move into the second half, but our expectation is that, it still remains positive. So, again, we are projecting that the economy continues to gradually improve and that is baked into our guide on the top line. But as you kind of said meaningful type volume recovery to get there, I'd say, no. Most of that has already occurred based on what we've seen in 2020, with some modest improvement going forward in unit recovery. Yeah. Yeah. So, let me clarify. Okay? The 150 basis points is the rollover impact of acquisitions that closed during 2020. That includes acquisitions that closed in February of 2020. And that's nothing to do with Santek. Santek did not close by December 31. It is not in that 150 basis points. Based on the timing of when it closed in 2020, you get a rollover benefit, just because you didn't report a full year in 2020, that's the 150 basis points. If you were to just annualize the revenue of what we acquired in 2020, it's over $200 million. As we look forward, though, into 2021, our $600 million investment that we're anticipating, that does include Santek as well as other deals. We are not talking about right now about the revenue contribution that we are anticipating from those deals, because some of it's just based on when it closes in 2021, how much it will contribute in here."

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Mathews, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nStacey Mathews: Hello. I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Don Slager, our CEO; Jon Vander Ark, our President; and Brian DelGhiaccio, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance. \n I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\n The material that we discuss today is time-sensitive. If in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or a recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is November 5, 2020.\n Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.\n I want to point out that our SEC filings, our earnings press release, which includes GAAP reconciliation tables and a discussion of business activities, along with the recording of this call, are all available on Republic's website at republicservices.com. \n I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. \n With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. \nDonald Slager: Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business. The Republic team is working hard every day, delivering quality service to our customers and communities. Our deep expertise and dedication, together with the strength of our market position and assets, made these results possible. \n During the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1, which is an 11% increase over the prior year, and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 230 basis points to 30.3%. These strong operating results, together with effective cash management, helped us deliver $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow through Q3, which represents a 14% increase over the prior year. \n We believe investing our free cash flow in quality acquisitions is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value. We continue to prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. Year-to-date, we have invested $154 million in acquisitions. \n We recently received regulatory approval on a leading recycling and solid waste provider in the Twin Cities area. Combined with the previously discussed pending acquisition of Santek, we now expect to invest $850 million to $900 million in acquisitions in 2020. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we expect 2021 will be another strong year of activity. \n Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board recently approved a $2 billion, 3-year share repurchase authorization, which will begin in January 2021. This is consistent with prior practice. \n As we look forward, we remain optimistic about our business and continued prospects for profitable growth. Pricing continues to exceed cost inflation, volumes continue to recover and margins are expanding. Accordingly, we are raising our full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion.\n Additionally, with better visibility through the end of the year, we are reinstating adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.37 to $3.40 for the full year 2020. With respect to 2021, Jon will provide some color in just a few minutes. \n Before I turn the call over, I'd like to congratulate the Republic team for being certified as a Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year. We believe an engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success and the most important element in driving lasting results. This is yet another recognition of the inclusive culture we are building at Republic, one where the best people come to work. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon. \nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Don. During the third quarter, we successfully executed our pricing program, improved volume performance on a sequential basis, effectively managed costs and continued to make investments to drive future growth. \n Total core price was 4.5%. This included open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.2%. Core price represents price increases to our same-store customers, net of rollbacks. Average yield was 2.6%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit and takes into account the impact of customer churn. As expected, volumes were down compared to the prior year, but our performance improved sequentially. \n In the third quarter, volume decreased 3.4%. This compares favorably to the 7.4% volume decrease we experienced in the second quarter with all lines of business showing improvements from Q2 levels. By September, volumes were down only 2.7% versus the prior year.\n Third quarter small-container volume decreased by 4.8% and was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. We continue to see most of the volume decline concentrated to customers in the education, hospitality and restaurant businesses. However, we continue to see positive signs in our customer base, including small-container customers.\n Approximately 80% of customers that paused service have now returned, and approximately 45% of customers that decreased service levels at the onset of the pandemic have subsequently resumed. Said another way, only 1% of our small-container customer base is not receiving some level of service. Additionally, container weights were only 5% lighter during the third quarter compared to 13% lighter in the second quarter. This suggests continued improvement in economic activity.\n Third quarter large-container volume decreased 5.4%. The volume decline was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. By September, large-container volume was down 3.7% versus the prior year.\n Total landfill volume decreased 3.1% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 3.3% in MSW volume, which is offset by a decrease of 2.5% in C&D volume and a decrease of 11.7% in special waste volume. The decrease in special waste volume was due to jobs being deferred, not canceled, and the pipeline remains strong. \n Our customers continue to value our quality service and commitment to supporting them throughout the pandemic. Our Net Promoter Score increased 8 points from the prior year, and we maintained our low customer churn of 7%. We continue to invest in capabilities to deliver our customer-centric digital experience, which we believe will further differentiate us from our competitors. \n For example, during the quarter, we began piloting automated proactive communications to our customers. This allows customers to set up customized preferences to receive tailored communications through the channel of their choice. Further advancements in customer-facing technology were made possible by the strong foundation we built as part of our digital transformation, including our RISE platform. \n We continue to partner with our municipal customers to address the impact of COVID on our business. Third quarter residential weights remained up 10% versus the prior year, which was consistent with Q2. We also made further progress on renegotiating contracts with favorable pricing terms. We now have $855 million of annual revenue or 34% of our CPI-based contracts tied to a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. \n From an operational perspective, we effectively managed cost to meet the change in underlying demand for service. Thanks to the team's unwavering efforts, we reduced cost to more than offset the decline in revenue. This resulted in a $41 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion of 230 basis points. This was enabled in part by our RISE platform, which allows us to dynamically adjust our routes. We are now 97% complete with the implementation of the RISE platform across the organization. We also maintained our record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents by approximately 20% versus the prior year. This drove a 10% decrease in risk management costs. \n Next, turning to our environmental services business. Third quarter environmental services revenue decreased $34 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 130 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays of implant project work. Since mid-August, we have seen rig counts begin to increase, but expect revenue to remain compressed through the end of the year. \n Finally, turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 38% to $99 per ton in the third quarter. This compared to $72 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 7% decrease in inbound recycling volume. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 230 basis points to 30.3% in the third quarter. The components of margin expansion included 70 basis points of improvement from favorable net fuel and higher recycled commodity prices and 160 basis points of improvement from the underlying business. Margin expansion in the underlying business was broad-based, and nearly all operating expenses improved compared to the prior year. \n Additionally, SG&A as a percent of revenue was 10%, an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year. Our performance reflects cost controls put in place and reductions in nonessential spending while continuing to make investments for the future to ensure the long-term health of our business. \n Although we're not providing specific EBITDA margin guidance, I'd like to remind you that there's a 50 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter due to the timing of CNG tax credits. Even with this headwind, we expect EBITDA margin to be at or above fourth quarter 2019 performance. This would result in full year margin expansion and exceed our original full year EBITDA margin guidance that we provided back in February. \n Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Free cash flow growth was driven by an increase in earnings and improvements in working capital.\n The contribution from working capital includes a 1.5-day improvement in DSO, a 2-day improvement in DPO and $68 million of deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act. It's important to note that even without the benefit of the payroll tax deferral, adjusted free cash flow would be up nearly 7% compared to the prior year.\n Cash collections remain strong. We believe our DSO performance reflects our customers' willingness to pay for the high-quality service we provide and the essential nature of our business. As Don mentioned, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. It's important to note that this level of performance assumes over $1.2 billion of capital expenditures, which is an increase from our prior guidance and relatively consistent with the level of spend we contemplated in our original guidance back in February.\n While we have already achieved over 90% of this full year guide, it should be noted that certain expenditures are back-end loaded. During the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately 70% of our full year cash taxes, receive approximately 1/3 of our full year capital expenditures and anniversary the benefit from DSO and DPO improvements. \n Our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance assumes we will defer approximately $100 million under the CARES Act in 2020. However, if our performance is trending at or above the high end of our guidance range, it is highly likely we would repay the deferred taxes early.\n During the quarter, total debt was $8.8 billion, and total liquidity increased to $3.4 billion. This includes our new 364-day credit facility. Our leverage ratio was approximately 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. \n Interest expense in the third quarter was $89 million and included $17 million of noncash amortization expense. During the quarter, we refinanced our 2021 bonds to capitalize on the low interest rate environment. This will reduce cash interest by approximately $22 million per year, which we'll begin to realize in the fourth quarter. \n Our adjusted income tax provision was $75 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19%. Together with the $8 million charge from solar investments, we had a total tax-related impact of $83 million during the quarter or 21% of adjusted earnings before taxes. The charge related to solar investments is recorded as a loss from unconsolidated investments on our income statement.\n The 21% all-in rate was less than our statutory rate of 27%, which resulted in an EPS benefit of approximately $0.08 during the quarter. We expect an all-in tax-related impact of 27% of EBT in the fourth quarter, which will be made up of the income tax provision and charges from solar investments. \n Let me now turn the call over to Jon to provide some initial thoughts on 2021. \nJon Vander Ark: You've heard Don, Brian and me talk about the positive momentum in the business, which we believe will carry over into 2021 to drive continued growth in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. In particular, we believe we will improve free cash flow conversion and deliver high single-digit adjusted free cash flow growth in 2021. As usual, we will provide full year 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. \n With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. \nHamzah Mazari: My first question is just on free cash conversion. I think if you look pre-pandemic, Republic sort of ran at like 41%. Your largest competitor is in the high-40% range. Maybe if you could talk about -- can you get to the high 40s? Is there anything structural preventing that? And I'm not looking at 2020 just because it's a very different year. But just looking at your historic free cash flow conversion relative to your largest peer, what should we be thinking about in terms of catching that up? \nDonald Slager: Hamzah, this is Don. Yes is the short answer. Cash flow conversion is a conversation we have here all the time. Our cash flow conversion is moving north. There's nothing structural that prevents us from getting above the 40%, midpoint into the high 40s. When we provide a detailed guidance with you guys in February, we're going to be talking more about that. But yes, you can expect the cash flow conversion to move up from its historical levels. \nJon Vander Ark: And just to add to that, I think you'll see opportunities on both sides, right, the numerator and the denominator. We see opportunities to both increase the EBITDA margin as well as manage capital expenditures to drive that number. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. And to Jon's point, Hamzah, that's the real leverage, right? So if you're expanding both, that's why we believe that we're going to be able to grow free cash flow by improving free cash flow margin at a greater rate than we're increasing earnings. \nHamzah Mazari: Got it. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up question, I'll turn it over. Very strong margin performance, 30%-plus EBITDA. Could you maybe talk about the sustainability of that margin profile going forward? I know time and weight is a big part of your cost structure, and this is a unique time. But how should we think about sort of cost coming back into the system as you see volume improve? And how much of the margin increase we've seen is kind of structural in nature? \nDonald Slager: Yes. Good question, Hamzah. So a couple of things to keep in mind. One is seasonality. Third quarter is typically our high point in terms of margin. So you're going to see some natural regression if you get seasonality in the business. And to your point, during the pandemic, there have been a few tailwinds just in terms of productivity with lack of traffic as well as lower container waste and small-container while maintaining that revenue profile. So those certainly help us, and we expect to dissipate some as we go forward. \n That being said, we've learned a lot of things in the pandemic and do believe we found a different level of performance in terms of productivity and safety, which is associated to our risk cost. And some of that is the pandemic, and some of that is just the return on the investment we've made over the years in digital operations and our operating discipline. And those things are all starting to accrue to the bottom line. And again, we expect to have line of sight to a 30% margin over the next few years on a sustainable basis. \nOperator: The next question will be from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. \nPatrick Brown: Hey, Brian, so lots of info in the prepared remarks, but I just want to be clear. So in the 2020 guide of free cash flow, you're assuming $120 million payroll deferral benefit this year? \nBrian Delghiaccio: $100 million, Tyler. \nPatrick Brown: $100 million? $100 million. Okay. So then, Jon, whenever we think about your comments about free cash flow for next year being, I think, up in the high single-digit range, so is that number assuming something like $150 million payroll deferral negative comp? \nJon Vander Ark: Well... \nPatrick Brown: Is free cash flow looking better than high single digits? Or... \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. This is the way you have to think about it, Tyler, is just that you would have the normal payroll taxes that you would pay in any given year, plus you would have $50 million that you would have to repay from 2020. \nPatrick Brown: Right. But your high single digit is a comp, right, versus prior year? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Yes, correct. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. No, you're right, it's $150 million. \nJon Vander Ark: Correct. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Starting point to end point headwind we're overcoming and still achieving the high single-digit free cash flow growth. \nPatrick Brown: Yes, yes, yes, that's my point. Okay. That's good. And then so in the table in the release, I think, Jon, you noted that resi yields were north of 3% this quarter. I think that maybe the first time, at least in a limited history, I'm looking at it. But I'm just curious, do you think that we have enough of that alternative index that separate the increased mix to kind of drive sustainability in that? \nDonald Slager: Listen, we won't have enough until we have 100% of the book. So we continue to march into City Hall and get a pricing index that we think reflects our cost structure and giving our frontline workforce a sustainable wage increase every year, which we do. And so -- and recycling is a big part of that. So recycling 2.0, we've talked a lot about getting to a right pricing mechanism in that.\n And then, listen, we've been heavy at the curb in the pandemic as people have sheltered in place. And so the waste shed has moved from small business to homes. And we've got over 100 customers already that have given us price increases to reflect that elevated cost structure, and we're relentless. We are not going to stop continuing to ask for that price increase. \n So listen, there's some puts and takes any given quarter on when pricing hits sort of the resets of given markets. But our aspiration to get a yield that better reflects our overall business mix in residential is unrelenting, and we'll continue to work with our municipal customers on that front. \nPatrick Brown: Did resi margins go up? \nJon Vander Ark: They did. Yes. \nOperator: Next question will be from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. \nWalter Spracklin: So my first question here is on technology. Obviously, you've made some significant and meaningful investments on the technological front. If we were to put it into 3 buckets as being kind of revenue-generative as you provide a better service as a result of that technology, cost saving because you're becoming more efficient or safety-related, if you look at the $1 spent last year in technology, how would you bucket into those categories? And what evidence, say, for revenue-generative have you seen the success of that technological spend? \nDonald Slager: Yes. So we don't break down the specific nature of that spend. We certainly invested in all 3 categories, steady investment on safety, which has been going on for a number of years, heavier investment on the operating side and the customer side. And while there's some distinction between those 2, there's also a lot of relatedness between those 2. \n So when we put in our RISE dispatch platform and we put tablets in our trucks, that certainly helps us become more productive and efficient. It also provides a better customer experience, right? It allows us to improve our -- improve on our 99.9% on-time delivery rate. It also allows us to communicate with a customer in a different way in terms of proactive service notifications and verification over time, which again makes our product even better and drive even higher level of loyalty. \n So investments on all fronts in online buying and billing and taking calls out of the call center. So we're investing on all fronts and certainly have not pulled back on any of those investments in the pandemic, right? We've invested as much as efforts. So this isn't just about performance, it's certainly about running the business for the long term. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. And I think you saw, Walter, in my remarks, I talked about spending a similar level of CapEx this year as we originally guided. Even though we've got lower volumes, a lot of that is because we're investing more in this digital transformation. And we think that based on the benefits we've seen so far, that there's much more to come, and that's why we're trying to accelerate that spend. \nWalter Spracklin: Okay. That's great color. And my second follow-up question here is on the M&A environment. Can you speak a little bit about your pipeline, I guess, specifically whether there had been a degree of pull forward of M&A activity in advance of the election and whether you think a lull might be created here post election as a result of that pull forward? \nDonald Slager: Yes. There was certainly some accelerated activity in wanting deals to close in a certain time period. I think there's far much less people who wanted to sell because they thought there was going to be a certain political risk and then, therefore, don't want to sell because they see the election coming out in a different way than they expected. \n But people typically sell for structural events, right? They have a change in their life circumstances. There's a generational transition where the next generation doesn't want to run the business. There's some life-changing events, something happens that triggers people to sell. And again, the political risk and what they think would be implications around taxes might accelerate timing a month or 2, but that isn't really driving activity in our experience. \nWalter Spracklin: So the pipeline, as you see it, really hasn't changed from October to December? \nDonald Slager: The pipeline has not changed, and it remains strong. \nOperator: The next question will be from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. \nKyle White: I just want to focus on volumes. They're a bit better than I expected and better than your peers, even your sequential improvement was better. You're also one of the few calling for kind of gradual improvement here for the remainder of this year, whereas others seem to be more flattish. Is there anything notable that is driving this relative to the others? And just any high-level thoughts on the economy from your vantage point and views on different subsectors here going into 4Q? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Listen, we see steady improvement. Listen, there's puts and takes in different spots. So if you dial in to any specific geography, right, you might see some flat lining or if people have temporary shelter-in-place orders even in a slight pullback, but I think it's the power of the portfolio overall, both geographically and across business lines. And again, we have a really strong special waste pipeline for the fourth quarter. I feel very good about that. And we're just -- we're seeing steady improvements across the business. I think we remain cautious in the sense that there's certainly still some uncertainty about we're in a pandemic, right, and how the pandemic moves is uncertain. And so we remain mindful and watchful of that. But based on the trends we're seeing, we see pretty good progress momentum. And that's the external standpoint. \n The one thing I think we've done well is we've been very engaged with our customers, right? We have a sales team that is highly connected to meet their needs, which is if they need to dial back service, we're dialing back service. But when they're ready to increase service, right, we're connecting with them frequently to make sure that they're ready to come back online. We moved our call centers from all in-buildings to 98% work from home in about a 72-hour period without any drop of service. And our performance metrics are as good or better than ever in that environment. So that's also enabled us to serve the customer. \nDonald Slager: Yes. So let me add to that. The top line is better than what people may have expected. But again, the operation has been really strong, right? So we've talked for a long time about the strength of the company, the strength of the team. And we've talked about our resilience of the business model, but that's still all true. But what we're seeing now, to Jon's point, is agility, right? Jon mentioned how quickly we adapted to new ways of working, adoption, how quickly we're changing to new -- using and adopting tools like the RISE platform and then momentum, right? So we're -- all the investments, all the efforts of the last several years, call it, decade kind of compounding, coming together kind of this breakout moment with a crazy backdrop of COVID. But all that together builds this momentum through the year and carries us really well into 2021. \nKyle White: Got you. And just a follow-up. I think you mentioned that you continue to see the biggest volume declines in education, hospitality, and I missed the third category. But is there any way to quantify your exposure to these kind of subsectors? And how have they performed in October relative to September? \nJon Vander Ark: Well, let me take education, for example, right? I mean, normally, we have a pretty big seasonal upswing here in September as all those schools come back online. And we've just seen what you've seen, which is people are moving all over the place. Some schools are fully in person, some are fully remote, and then others have hybrid options that have every kind of variation in between. So we've been flexible with our customers to adjust our service level to better meet their needs. \nDonald Slager: It's clearly temporary, right? It's going to, at some point, get back to in-class learning, right? And then that business just comes back when it comes back. And it builds right into our route base, so it usually comes in at a pretty decent margin to boot. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. And one of the things we had mentioned last quarter what the impact was from education. And if you take a look in the third quarter, it was about 20% of our small-container decline was due to education alone. \nOperator: The next question will be from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nSean Eastman: I just wanted to ask Hamzah's question just in a bit of a different way. I mean just considering all these moving parts, considerably better margins than expected this year, is sort of a normal 30 basis points-ish kind of margin expansion outcome achievable in 2021? \nBrian Delghiaccio: You're talking about for the full year, 30%? \nSean Eastman: I'm just talking about, can RSG expand margins sort of at a normalized, say, 30 basis point level year-over-year in 2021 in light of some of these nonrecurring cost savings in 2020? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. Look, I think you do have to take into consideration, Jon mentioned it, right, there are certainly some things that are happening in the macro environment, right, things that are helping productivity, some of the lighter container weights. So there are some puts and takes. But we do feel that 30% margin, an improvement towards 30% margin is something that's in the near term, right? And it's going to be something that we're going to continue to move toward. '21 might have a little bit of noise in it just because you have some of those macro benefits modulating. But after that, certainly, 30-plus basis points a year is something that's certainly achievable. \nDonald Slager: We're on the cost. \nSean Eastman: Got you. All right. Great. And is there any reason to think price won't trend up next year? I mean it was called out, the resi yield number was really a standout in the quarter. Does that give us some juice into next year? I mean what are the puts and takes there? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Our pricing philosophy certainly hasn't changed over the pandemic, which is to get a fair price for the great work that we do. I think you'll see continued strong pricing in the open markets. On pricing on the landfill side, I think that's a slight headwind on CPI, which we have a 10 -- 12- to 18-month lag in terms of when that CPI changes and when that actually hits our contracts on how those escalators work. So that will provide sort of a headwind, but there's no fundamental change in our pricing philosophy. And we'll expect to have strong kind of mid-2s yield at a minimum. \nDonald Slager: Yes. Take a look at the progress that was made in converting the book on the resi municipal business that Jon talked about. The 100 contracts or so that have already engaged with us and approved price increases because of the elevated volumes, that's a great new trend. And we're going to continue just like when others -- things like this occur, we'll push through that. And landfill pricing has held up very well, right? And we still think that there's room in landfill pricing and that a lot of the pricing still needs to emanate from the landfills based on the cost structure there and the difficulty of permitting and expanding landfills. I mean those -- that pricing will continue to stay strong. And overall, through all this sort of chaos, the market was very rational, right? And that's the backdrop. \nSean Eastman: Yes. Excellent. Super helpful summary there. And again, nice work. \nDonald Slager: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question will be from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. \nJeffrey Goldstein: Can you just compare how you're thinking about the volume recoveries between both small-container and large-container at this point? I know large-container had a larger initial drop, and now they're booked down about a similar rate in this quarter. So just going forward, would you expect a large-container recovery to pick up faster, especially given some tailwinds we're seeing, especially around housing? Or would you expect those to move relatively in lockstep going forward? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Look, there's certainly -- I mean when we look at single-family housing starts and some of the strength that we've seen in some of those prints, right, we've had in our investor presentations how that positively impacts our volumes generally about 12 months later. So we tend to lag. But the one thing when you take a look at small and large container, remember, a good portion of our large-container business is permanent in nature, right? So it's -- you're kind of talking more about the temporary portion of that, which tends to be the construction-related and then some of the other event jobs. That's where you might see some acceleration out more on the event side. But the permanent large-container and the permanent small-container tend to move at about the same rate. \nDonald Slager: Yes. It really just depends what happens with schools. It depends what happens with the restaurants. And a lot of restaurants have gotten very innovative in the North in terms of outdoor dining, and that will be more of a challenge as we move into the late fall/winter season here. So there'll be a few puts and takes that could impact us the next quarter or 2 in small-container in terms of that trend, maybe a little bit less than the large-container firm. But I don't think there'll be any fundamental differences for that. \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. And the sequential gap continues to close, I guess. \nJeffrey Goldstein: Okay. That was all very helpful. And then on the recent pledge to purchase 2,500 electric trucks, and I know you're a few years away from actual integration of those vehicles, but can you just talk about how you view those trucks relative to diesel and CNG in operations today? And maybe any rule of thumb we can think of in terms of financial benefit, if any, you'd be expecting? Or is it mostly just an environmental benefit from your point of view? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. No, we're very bullish on electrification long term. We think that's the winning technology in the space because that's the only truly 0 emissions option out there. But we've said all along, it's going to be a challenge, and it'll take time, right? We're going to have to work making commitments in the space because we need to innovate and help innovate. We've got relationships across the value chain, right, that we're showing a leadership position in that over time.\n We also have fundamental belief that if something is going to be environmentally sustainable over time, it's got to be economically sustainable. So we don't expect to do this by reducing returns. We expect over time to amp returns. Now there might be some puts and takes between higher upfront CapEx and then lower operating costs through reduced fuel cost or reduce maintenance costs over time. But again, we're very proactive in that space. \nDonald Slager: Now look, we're the seventh largest vocational fleet in the nation. And to Jon's point, we are the right kind of company to be innovating and to be pushing innovation onto the market. And again, when you get there, those benefits accrue in large ways because we've got 16,000 trucks on the street every day. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. \nMichael Hoffman: I do have 2 specific my questions, but there's 2 I'd like to make sure I get -- everybody heard the answer correctly, if you would bear with me. My 2 specifics are 160 basis points in solid waste improvement. If you thought about traffic and that type of productivity, what's that give back out of the 160 when we're all driving full time and you guys have increased labor for that? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Michael, it's hard to -- we're looking at that, right? It's hard to tease that out exactly because again, we have a mix of 2 things going on. One, we've got lower traffic patterns because of people sheltering in place, and we also have the rollout of all of our digital tools driving higher productivity.\n Listen, we hope to -- we're not going to sustain all of it, but we hope to sustain a lot of it on the productivity side. And one of the things we've seen is not a big difference between rural and urban market productivity, right? So we're seeing benefits in both. And I would have expected to see, if it was purely pandemic-related, a lot bigger lift for us in urban markets, right? And we're seeing benefits across the board. So again, we -- back to our path -- our plan to expand margins, a big portion of that is capturing some of that productivity benefit going forward. \nDonald Slager: Yes. So look, there's definitely some impact, to your point, Michael, with traffic. But look, the initial rollout of the RISE platform is the foundational element surprise. The stuff the team is working on now, the next things that they'll layer in now once the platform is rolled out and established is additive, right? So there's going to be layer after layer of additional feature benefit and capability on that digital platform that's going to drive new margin expansion and better operations, better customer-facing stuff, more information in our pricing tools and just better, safer operations. \n Jon, do you want to talk about a couple of those things? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We've just -- the tablets in our trucks, right, and giving our people the visibility both in the branch as well as the driver out communicating together, right, not talking, seeing where those trucks are. And so a large-container route, for example, will have 7 movements in a day. It's about getting 8 movements in a day in the same time period while improving safety, while providing better customer service. So that's a very tangible example. We're seeing those tools accrue to the bottom line. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Hey, Michael, one thing I just wanted to kind of clarify that, too, is that when we talk about the 160 basis points, call it, at the underlying business, that's not just solid waste, that also includes the impact from environmental services. So the only thing that doesn't include of the 230 basis points of total margin expansion is the impact of both net fuel and higher commodity prices had on margin expansion. \nMichael Hoffman: Okay. All right, that's helpful . And then the clarification question, somebody asked something about margin and margin expansion, and I was scribbling really fast. You were expecting margins to expand next year, and maybe 30 is a great goal, but you're not giving a goal, but you expect margins to expand. Is that -- the way I was writing it down, it sounded like you were going to be flat. \nBrian Delghiaccio: No. We expect margins to expand. We're not giving a guide on that topic, but we are expecting margins to expand. \nMichael Hoffman: Right. And the other... \nDonald Slager: It is -- Michael, that's the point of momentum, right, when you heard me use that word, twice Jon used it, Brian, look, underlying strength in our business, sort of developmental strength in our people, resiliency in the mid-business model, again, rational backdrop and then, again, proven agility through this downturn, right, you prove it. You can't question it, right? You could see how quickly the company turned and reacted and adapted, adopted, proven agility and momentum, right? And that is the key takeaway here. I mean there is really strong momentum in the business, in the team and in all the work that's been done over recent years coming together to carry us into 2021. \nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then my second one is on free cash flow, and it's got both a clarification and a question in it. Maybe your conversion rate has been less than peers, but your fundamental year-over-year growth rate has been better than your major peer for a decade, one; and two, you do have headwinds. Your leverage ratio has been consistently higher and you pay out more in closure and post closure in absolute dollars. So the question is, do you expect to be able to raise this number by high single digit and still have all of that in front of you? \nDonald Slager: Yes. Look, we're not going to change the structural issue with legacy landfills, right, overall, right? I mean they're going to have that cost, maybe somebody else doesn't have. And our formula of returning cash to shareholders, the way we do is a very time-tested formula, right? We're going to continue to invest in capital even through this tough time.\n I mean, look, when we went through the Great Recession, we didn't stop investing in the business. We had strong enough cash flow to carry us. We continue to invest in fleet, all the other things. Through this year, we didn't shut it down. We actually, in some cases, accelerated some of the spending in some of the digital tools. And yes, I mean we're very strongly focused on cash flow conversion. And as I said earlier, we're going to get ahead of that 45% and going to carry us into northern 40% territory. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Right. And that's why I was saying, Michael, as I made those comments about both the combination of EBITDA margin expansion and being able to reduce expenditures, that combination is why we feel that there's going to be an accelerating event here on free cash flow conversion to drive that free cash flow growth. \nDonald Slager: Look at the things that Jon and Tim and the team have built momentum on. I mean look at -- we talked already about the -- changing the pricing mechanism on municipal, right, to a fair and equitable arrangement. That's underway. Recycling, making a lot of headway there. And it's not just the recycling markets that are helping us, right, they will, but we're, again, we're retooling that business, right, making it truly sustainable, right? That's happening. Now some pricing on the resi side for the elevated weights, right, all of those things.\n And then all the underlying operational benefits. I mean safety is a great story. Employee turnover is a great story. Engagement is a great story. All of those things adding up, and those are all going to come to fruition, I think, regardless of COVID. And then COVID sort of kicked this into another gear. We found new agility that we didn't have and made some other operational changes because we, frankly, had to. And those are going to carry in the future periods. \nOperator: The next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. \nDavid Manthey: Last quarter, you mentioned that about 15% of your labor cost was overtime, and it was down 25%. Can you tell us by how much overtime was down year-to-year in the third quarter and October, if you care to share that data? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. They were -- in the third quarter, it was down about 10% overtime hours year-over-year. \nDavid Manthey: Okay. And second, I realize you're not giving fourth quarter guidance. But due to the ongoing recovery here and your current mix of business, is it possible you might see lower-than-normal seasonality in the fourth quarter revenues based on those realities? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Well, if you think about seasonality, typically, what you see is an uptick in the second and primarily the third. So from a seasonal perspective, then you start to see it kind of come down in the fourth quarter. So your toughest bogey is generally the third quarter hit from a year-over-year perspective when you talk about seasonal volumes. So there typically isn't something that increases significantly in the fourth quarter from a volume perspective when you look at Q3 to Q4. \nDonald Slager: Yes. Except you might have some other just recovery because certain sectors open up, that book maybe shut down, right? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. \nDonald Slager: It might be economic, maybe construction in some places. \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Some of it is purely seasonal, which is in the North, there's construction activity that just doesn't happen because of the weather. Now there could be some special waste jobs that are teed up for us that we would have in the second or third quarter that have just gotten delayed. And now that people have more clarity going forward, that they'll hit, and we, again, we feel really good about that pipeline. So there should be some modest opportunities there. \nDonald Slager: Look, normally, seasonally, Q3 is our strongest quarter, 2 is our second strongest then 4 and then 1. \nBrian Delghiaccio: And 1, right. So we don't see certainly any headwinds as we look in the fourth quarter from a seasonal perspective year-over-year versus what we just went through in the third quarter. \nOperator: The next question is from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. \nMichael Feniger: Don, for many years, we were hearing about you guys intentionally shedding business. Every call, there would be a lot of questions on why your volumes were underperforming some peers. I guess my question is, one, are you guys kind of through that intentional shedding? And two, how do you think that has positioned you guys going into this downturn and really coming out of the downturn? \nDonald Slager: Well, look, you heard Jon used this phrase, the power of the portfolio, and that's something that we speak to a lot, right? And when you spend decades and decades building the business and pulling the business together the way we did, 5 public companies, blah, blah, blah, you end up with some stuff that you got to clean up. We're kind of through all that. We've done some puts and takes in markets. We've gone to markets. We've exited markets. We used to talk about national accounts and stuff we had to shed. We're not going to be talking much about that anymore. \n Now the fact is because we have a strong pipeline in acquisitions, right, as something like Jon talked about last quarter, we're always going to have some business that comes with an acquisition that may be likely to be shed because it doesn't sort of fit the model. But overall, we think we've done a good job. We think we've got a good filter and test in place on the way in as we're selling new business with all the sales tools that have been launched over recent years. So we think we've got the safety mechanism on the organic sales side. There'll still be some stuff that maybe gets shed through -- as a result of strong M&A. \n But look, we are well positioned. Again, the power of the portfolio works. It's the mix of geographies. It's the mix of business, large-container or small. It's a strong approach with fixing a big piece of the business, which happens to be municipal. It's been kind of our nemesis with tough recycling contracts, bad escalators, that's starting the outcome around the corner here for us. And it just again shows the relentlessness of the team, as Jon already mentioned. \n So all that work, right, just adds to the strength of the portfolio. That power of the portfolio is real. Seasonality, winter events, weather events balances out when you've got a strong portfolio. And no different than the portfolio that you invest in yourself, right? We have invested in building a strong portfolio and then sticking with it and then continually improving it over time. And it's just going to -- it will just get better and better as we go. \nMichael Feniger: That makes sense. And Don, just piggybacking off that, this is kind of a big-picture question. I mean you've seen a lot of consolidation in your day, big and small. Some of your peers right now are integrating some large-scale acquisitions in Q4 in the middle of COVID. You guys have elevated M&A, but you passed on some of these bigger deals. I'm curious how you and the management team think that positions the company kind of into 2021. \nDonald Slager: Well, look, we -- I would say this, we've been -- we've looked at every decent deal that's come around. I would say there's probably been times where we've had sort of the lead seat on some deals. And on an ROI basis, we just couldn't get as comfortable with it as we'd like, and we passed. And in a couple of cases, other people came in and decided to go forward with it. Some cases, people paid more than maybe we would have, right?\n There's a lot of really high-quality companies out there that we compete with vigorously every day, and we've got a pretty good look at who they are, how they operate. We know the good quality. Those are the companies we're talking to. We're not going to win every deal, right? I would say there tends to be a natural buyer, and that might be a cultural fit. It might be a geographic fit. It might just be where the purchasing company is in the life cycle or, frankly, what promises they've made to the market that they feel they have to keep. We're not in a situation where we're being paid some high-growth multiple and we've got to do things that are unnatural. \n So we stick to what we know. We've got a great M&A team, a great team of people out there who know their markets. Our 10-area presence all have market plans that think about how they want to expand their business through whether it's landfill expansions and acquisitions or new lines of business. All that is up and running. \n So look, I remember, when we paused M&A, when we did the big merger over a decade ago and then we put our toe back in the water, year-after-year, I've come to you and said, and we're going to do X next year. And sometimes we missed it a little bit because we've said no to some deals that proved, frankly, I'm worthy in the end. We found some things in diligence that we didn't like and we backed off. And we weren't so hot and heavy to make the number as we were to do its best for the company.\n And then there's years like this year where we're going to blow it out because opportunity arises. And these companies that we're buying today are high-quality companies and a really great fit. And that's how we're going to continue to play it. And we've taken some opportunity to expand the core a little bit. There's some great opportunity that the team has brought to us that expand our abilities in around the environmental space that we're fond of. \n So that's going to continue. And we haven't given you, again, guidance on that, and we will talk about that in February based on what the pipeline is. And  -- but when we say we're well positioned, I think you can take that to the bank. We're well positioned. \nMichael Feniger: And just off that, what do you expect to close in 2020? Can you -- or Brian, can you give us a number on how much rollover do we get on the top line? Is there a way you can just kind of frame that for us? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. With that $850 million to $900 million investment that we guided to, again, it's going to be very heavily back-end loaded. We would expect, call it, 150 basis points plus of acquisition rollover on the top line. \nMichael Feniger: Okay. That's perfect. And just lastly, I know -- I might have missed this with October. Did you guys say was October volumes up versus September, kind of flat sequentially? I might have missed that. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. They were somewhat flattish from September levels, but about a 100 basis point improvement from the Q3 average. \nOperator: The next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: I think you mentioned the 160 bps expansion in margin was inclusive of environmental services, which I got to imagine was a relative drag, at least versus the average. So any chance you can quantify the environmental services margin impacts in the quarter? How you think about that for the year? And then if you extrapolate the current run rate to '21, what does that mean for margin impact year-over-year? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. So within the 160 of expansion, overall, there was a 20 basis point headwind from the environmental services business. \nNoah Kaye: And I know you're not giving formal guidance, but just thinking about it for the year, you would expect to be a continued headwind? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. In the fourth quarter, yes. Yes, probably at a similar level, if you will. \nNoah Kaye: Yes. And so if we annualize that into next year, you may be looking, just on the significant drop-off, you may be looking at a little bit of a headwind again in 2021, but not massive.\n Okay. And just to clarify, the high single-digit growth in free cash flow year-over-year, that view, that does include the contributions from the chunkier acquisitions, correct? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Correct. Yes. \nNoah Kaye: Okay. Great. So one -- after specific questions, one more general one. I think as one of my peers noted, relative to some of the other companies in this space, you are looking for continued improvement here. If I just step back and look at the consumers' personal savings rate here in the third quarter, I mean it's doubled year-over-year. There is a lot of cash on a relative basis sitting with the consumer. Now some of it may be going into house down payments or what have you. But eventually, that cash has to come off the sidelines. And I guess I just want to see how you think that translates to the recovery into the eventual growth here.  You're talking about large-container maybe picking up, maybe it stays in the resi line of business, but just your thoughts there. \nDonald Slager: Look, we're not going to give you the exact formula because there's too much mix involved, right? But look, I mean our business grows based on population growth, household formation, business formation. So very simply, more people, right, job creation, wage growth, more people working, people sort of settling down after sort of the chaos. There have been a lot of chaos this year, right, COVID, social unrest, the election. I was suffering personally from a great deal of election fatigue, okay? And so I'm sure a lot of people were, right? \n So things are going to start to settle down. America ends up conquering all in the end. How much time will it take? To your point, people have a lot of savings set aside. People are waiting to see. We have good news from the Fed today. Look, as things get back to normal, right, and we get on a path, economy recovers and people find a way to continue to sort of save and grow their businesses, as Jon mentioned, people innovate, we see it all the time, we're going to be right there with it. Our market position, it allows us to take full advantage of all that organic growth somewhat naturally. And then our ability to grow through M&A, our ability to look at even expanding some of our core offerings, a lot of good there. \n And so we're well positioned. Strong balance sheet, strong asset base, strong market position, strong team, I can go on and on and on and brag about this group. So this quarter is a great showing of all the hard work that's been going on. And I said strength, resilience and now an expression of agility and real momentum in the business. And with a good backdrop, I think now, as things start to settle down around us, then it will be a good story to tell. And we'll be here in February to share with you the full year results and the outlook for '21 in more detail. And based on what we see today, I think everyone will be pretty happy with that. \nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. \nDonald Slager: Thank you, Chad. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and continue to have a positive outlook on our business. We delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth, expanded EBITDA margin and achieved EBITDA margin performance above 30%. We raised our full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance, and we see strong free cash flow growth in 2021. Once again, we have proved the resiliency of our business and the strength of our model. \n I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hard work, commitment and dedication exhibited by our 36,000 team members this year. At the onset of COVID, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize our frontline employees who deliver an essential service to our communities across the country each and every day. And since then, their dedication has continued. Even through record-setting weather events, including fires and hurricanes and, frankly, you name it, they've never let up. And it's their consistency and willingness to take care of our customers, communities and each other that makes them truly relentless and makes me proud to work for Republic Services. \n I hope you all have a good evening. Stay safe out there. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Don. During the third quarter, we successfully executed our pricing program, improved volume performance on a sequential basis, effectively managed costs and continued to make investments to drive future growth. \n Total core price was 4.5%. This included open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.2%. Core price represents price increases to our same-store customers, net of rollbacks. Average yield was 2.6%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit and takes into account the impact of customer churn. As expected, volumes were down compared to the prior year, but our performance improved sequentially. \n In the third quarter, volume decreased 3.4%. This compares favorably to the 7.4% volume decrease we experienced in the second quarter with all lines of business showing improvements from Q2 levels. By September, volumes were down only 2.7% versus the prior year.\n Third quarter small-container volume decreased by 4.8% and was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. We continue to see most of the volume decline concentrated to customers in the education, hospitality and restaurant businesses. However, we continue to see positive signs in our customer base, including small-container customers.\n Approximately 80% of customers that paused service have now returned, and approximately 45% of customers that decreased service levels at the onset of the pandemic have subsequently resumed. Said another way, only 1% of our small-container customer base is not receiving some level of service. Additionally, container weights were only 5% lighter during the third quarter compared to 13% lighter in the second quarter. This suggests continued improvement in economic activity.\n Third quarter large-container volume decreased 5.4%. The volume decline was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. By September, large-container volume was down 3.7% versus the prior year.\n Total landfill volume decreased 3.1% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 3.3% in MSW volume, which is offset by a decrease of 2.5% in C&D volume and a decrease of 11.7% in special waste volume. The decrease in special waste volume was due to jobs being deferred, not canceled, and the pipeline remains strong. \n Our customers continue to value our quality service and commitment to supporting them throughout the pandemic. Our Net Promoter Score increased 8 points from the prior year, and we maintained our low customer churn of 7%. We continue to invest in capabilities to deliver our customer-centric digital experience, which we believe will further differentiate us from our competitors. \n For example, during the quarter, we began piloting automated proactive communications to our customers. This allows customers to set up customized preferences to receive tailored communications through the channel of their choice. Further advancements in customer-facing technology were made possible by the strong foundation we built as part of our digital transformation, including our RISE platform. \n We continue to partner with our municipal customers to address the impact of COVID on our business. Third quarter residential weights remained up 10% versus the prior year, which was consistent with Q2. We also made further progress on renegotiating contracts with favorable pricing terms. We now have $855 million of annual revenue or 34% of our CPI-based contracts tied to a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. \n From an operational perspective, we effectively managed cost to meet the change in underlying demand for service. Thanks to the team's unwavering efforts, we reduced cost to more than offset the decline in revenue. This resulted in a $41 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion of 230 basis points. This was enabled in part by our RISE platform, which allows us to dynamically adjust our routes. We are now 97% complete with the implementation of the RISE platform across the organization. We also maintained our record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents by approximately 20% versus the prior year. This drove a 10% decrease in risk management costs. \n Next, turning to our environmental services business. Third quarter environmental services revenue decreased $34 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 130 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays of implant project work. Since mid-August, we have seen rig counts begin to increase, but expect revenue to remain compressed through the end of the year. \n Finally, turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 38% to $99 per ton in the third quarter. This compared to $72 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 7% decrease in inbound recycling volume. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian. You've heard Don, Brian and me talk about the positive momentum in the business, which we believe will carry over into 2021 to drive continued growth in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. In particular, we believe we will improve free cash flow conversion and deliver high single-digit adjusted free cash flow growth in 2021. As usual, we will provide full year 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. \n With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. And just to add to that, I think you'll see opportunities on both sides, right, the numerator and the denominator. We see opportunities to both increase the EBITDA margin as well as manage capital expenditures to drive that number. Well... Yes. This is the way you have to think about it, Tyler, is just that you would have the normal payroll taxes that you would pay in any given year, plus you would have $50 million that you would have to repay from 2020. Yes. Yes, correct. Correct. They did. Yes. Yes. Listen, we see steady improvement. Listen, there's puts and takes in different spots. So if you dial in to any specific geography, right, you might see some flat lining or if people have temporary shelter-in-place orders even in a slight pullback, but I think it's the power of the portfolio overall, both geographically and across business lines. And again, we have a really strong special waste pipeline for the fourth quarter. I feel very good about that. And we're just -- we're seeing steady improvements across the business. I think we remain cautious in the sense that there's certainly still some uncertainty about we're in a pandemic, right, and how the pandemic moves is uncertain. And so we remain mindful and watchful of that. But based on the trends we're seeing, we see pretty good progress momentum. And that's the external standpoint. \n The one thing I think we've done well is we've been very engaged with our customers, right? We have a sales team that is highly connected to meet their needs, which is if they need to dial back service, we're dialing back service. But when they're ready to increase service, right, we're connecting with them frequently to make sure that they're ready to come back online. We moved our call centers from all in-buildings to 98% work from home in about a 72-hour period without any drop of service. And our performance metrics are as good or better than ever in that environment. So that's also enabled us to serve the customer. Well, let me take education, for example, right? I mean, normally, we have a pretty big seasonal upswing here in September as all those schools come back online. And we've just seen what you've seen, which is people are moving all over the place. Some schools are fully in person, some are fully remote, and then others have hybrid options that have every kind of variation in between. So we've been flexible with our customers to adjust our service level to better meet their needs. Yes. Our pricing philosophy certainly hasn't changed over the pandemic, which is to get a fair price for the great work that we do. I think you'll see continued strong pricing in the open markets. On pricing on the landfill side, I think that's a slight headwind on CPI, which we have a 10 -- 12- to 18-month lag in terms of when that CPI changes and when that actually hits our contracts on how those escalators work. So that will provide sort of a headwind, but there's no fundamental change in our pricing philosophy. And we'll expect to have strong kind of mid-2s yield at a minimum. Yes. Look, there's certainly -- I mean when we look at single-family housing starts and some of the strength that we've seen in some of those prints, right, we've had in our investor presentations how that positively impacts our volumes generally about 12 months later. So we tend to lag. But the one thing when you take a look at small and large container, remember, a good portion of our large-container business is permanent in nature, right? So it's -- you're kind of talking more about the temporary portion of that, which tends to be the construction-related and then some of the other event jobs. That's where you might see some acceleration out more on the event side. But the permanent large-container and the permanent small-container tend to move at about the same rate. Yes. And the sequential gap continues to close, I guess. Yes. No, we're very bullish on electrification long term. We think that's the winning technology in the space because that's the only truly 0 emissions option out there. But we've said all along, it's going to be a challenge, and it'll take time, right? We're going to have to work making commitments in the space because we need to innovate and help innovate. We've got relationships across the value chain, right, that we're showing a leadership position in that over time.\n We also have fundamental belief that if something is going to be environmentally sustainable over time, it's got to be economically sustainable. So we don't expect to do this by reducing returns. We expect over time to amp returns. Now there might be some puts and takes between higher upfront CapEx and then lower operating costs through reduced fuel cost or reduce maintenance costs over time. But again, we're very proactive in that space. Yes. Michael, it's hard to -- we're looking at that, right? It's hard to tease that out exactly because again, we have a mix of 2 things going on. One, we've got lower traffic patterns because of people sheltering in place, and we also have the rollout of all of our digital tools driving higher productivity.\n Listen, we hope to -- we're not going to sustain all of it, but we hope to sustain a lot of it on the productivity side. And one of the things we've seen is not a big difference between rural and urban market productivity, right? So we're seeing benefits in both. And I would have expected to see, if it was purely pandemic-related, a lot bigger lift for us in urban markets, right? And we're seeing benefits across the board. So again, we -- back to our path -- our plan to expand margins, a big portion of that is capturing some of that productivity benefit going forward. Yes. We've just -- the tablets in our trucks, right, and giving our people the visibility both in the branch as well as the driver out communicating together, right, not talking, seeing where those trucks are. And so a large-container route, for example, will have 7 movements in a day. It's about getting 8 movements in a day in the same time period while improving safety, while providing better customer service. So that's a very tangible example. We're seeing those tools accrue to the bottom line. Yes. Some of it is purely seasonal, which is in the North, there's construction activity that just doesn't happen because of the weather. Now there could be some special waste jobs that are teed up for us that we would have in the second or third quarter that have just gotten delayed. And now that people have more clarity going forward, that they'll hit, and we, again, we feel really good about that pipeline. So there should be some modest opportunities there."

            "name": "Donald Slager",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business. The Republic team is working hard every day, delivering quality service to our customers and communities. Our deep expertise and dedication, together with the strength of our market position and assets, made these results possible. \n During the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1, which is an 11% increase over the prior year, and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 230 basis points to 30.3%. These strong operating results, together with effective cash management, helped us deliver $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow through Q3, which represents a 14% increase over the prior year. \n We believe investing our free cash flow in quality acquisitions is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value. We continue to prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. Year-to-date, we have invested $154 million in acquisitions. \n We recently received regulatory approval on a leading recycling and solid waste provider in the Twin Cities area. Combined with the previously discussed pending acquisition of Santek, we now expect to invest $850 million to $900 million in acquisitions in 2020. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we expect 2021 will be another strong year of activity. \n Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board recently approved a $2 billion, 3-year share repurchase authorization, which will begin in January 2021. This is consistent with prior practice. \n As we look forward, we remain optimistic about our business and continued prospects for profitable growth. Pricing continues to exceed cost inflation, volumes continue to recover and margins are expanding. Accordingly, we are raising our full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion.\n Additionally, with better visibility through the end of the year, we are reinstating adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.37 to $3.40 for the full year 2020. With respect to 2021, Jon will provide some color in just a few minutes. \n Before I turn the call over, I'd like to congratulate the Republic team for being certified as a Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year. We believe an engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success and the most important element in driving lasting results. This is yet another recognition of the inclusive culture we are building at Republic, one where the best people come to work. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon. Hamzah, this is Don. Yes is the short answer. Cash flow conversion is a conversation we have here all the time. Our cash flow conversion is moving north. There's nothing structural that prevents us from getting above the 40%, midpoint into the high 40s. When we provide a detailed guidance with you guys in February, we're going to be talking more about that. But yes, you can expect the cash flow conversion to move up from its historical levels. Yes. Good question, Hamzah. So a couple of things to keep in mind. One is seasonality. Third quarter is typically our high point in terms of margin. So you're going to see some natural regression if you get seasonality in the business. And to your point, during the pandemic, there have been a few tailwinds just in terms of productivity with lack of traffic as well as lower container waste and small-container while maintaining that revenue profile. So those certainly help us, and we expect to dissipate some as we go forward. \n That being said, we've learned a lot of things in the pandemic and do believe we found a different level of performance in terms of productivity and safety, which is associated to our risk cost. And some of that is the pandemic, and some of that is just the return on the investment we've made over the years in digital operations and our operating discipline. And those things are all starting to accrue to the bottom line. And again, we expect to have line of sight to a 30% margin over the next few years on a sustainable basis. Listen, we won't have enough until we have 100% of the book. So we continue to march into City Hall and get a pricing index that we think reflects our cost structure and giving our frontline workforce a sustainable wage increase every year, which we do. And so -- and recycling is a big part of that. So recycling 2.0, we've talked a lot about getting to a right pricing mechanism in that.\n And then, listen, we've been heavy at the curb in the pandemic as people have sheltered in place. And so the waste shed has moved from small business to homes. And we've got over 100 customers already that have given us price increases to reflect that elevated cost structure, and we're relentless. We are not going to stop continuing to ask for that price increase. \n So listen, there's some puts and takes any given quarter on when pricing hits sort of the resets of given markets. But our aspiration to get a yield that better reflects our overall business mix in residential is unrelenting, and we'll continue to work with our municipal customers on that front. Yes. So we don't break down the specific nature of that spend. We certainly invested in all 3 categories, steady investment on safety, which has been going on for a number of years, heavier investment on the operating side and the customer side. And while there's some distinction between those 2, there's also a lot of relatedness between those 2. \n So when we put in our RISE dispatch platform and we put tablets in our trucks, that certainly helps us become more productive and efficient. It also provides a better customer experience, right? It allows us to improve our -- improve on our 99.9% on-time delivery rate. It also allows us to communicate with a customer in a different way in terms of proactive service notifications and verification over time, which again makes our product even better and drive even higher level of loyalty. \n So investments on all fronts in online buying and billing and taking calls out of the call center. So we're investing on all fronts and certainly have not pulled back on any of those investments in the pandemic, right? We've invested as much as efforts. So this isn't just about performance, it's certainly about running the business for the long term. Yes. There was certainly some accelerated activity in wanting deals to close in a certain time period. I think there's far much less people who wanted to sell because they thought there was going to be a certain political risk and then, therefore, don't want to sell because they see the election coming out in a different way than they expected. \n But people typically sell for structural events, right? They have a change in their life circumstances. There's a generational transition where the next generation doesn't want to run the business. There's some life-changing events, something happens that triggers people to sell. And again, the political risk and what they think would be implications around taxes might accelerate timing a month or 2, but that isn't really driving activity in our experience. The pipeline has not changed, and it remains strong. Yes. So let me add to that. The top line is better than what people may have expected. But again, the operation has been really strong, right? So we've talked for a long time about the strength of the company, the strength of the team. And we've talked about our resilience of the business model, but that's still all true. But what we're seeing now, to Jon's point, is agility, right? Jon mentioned how quickly we adapted to new ways of working, adoption, how quickly we're changing to new -- using and adopting tools like the RISE platform and then momentum, right? So we're -- all the investments, all the efforts of the last several years, call it, decade kind of compounding, coming together kind of this breakout moment with a crazy backdrop of COVID. But all that together builds this momentum through the year and carries us really well into 2021. It's clearly temporary, right? It's going to, at some point, get back to in-class learning, right? And then that business just comes back when it comes back. And it builds right into our route base, so it usually comes in at a pretty decent margin to boot. We're on the cost. Yes. Take a look at the progress that was made in converting the book on the resi municipal business that Jon talked about. The 100 contracts or so that have already engaged with us and approved price increases because of the elevated volumes, that's a great new trend. And we're going to continue just like when others -- things like this occur, we'll push through that. And landfill pricing has held up very well, right? And we still think that there's room in landfill pricing and that a lot of the pricing still needs to emanate from the landfills based on the cost structure there and the difficulty of permitting and expanding landfills. I mean those -- that pricing will continue to stay strong. And overall, through all this sort of chaos, the market was very rational, right? And that's the backdrop. Okay. Thank you. Yes. It really just depends what happens with schools. It depends what happens with the restaurants. And a lot of restaurants have gotten very innovative in the North in terms of outdoor dining, and that will be more of a challenge as we move into the late fall/winter season here. So there'll be a few puts and takes that could impact us the next quarter or 2 in small-container in terms of that trend, maybe a little bit less than the large-container firm. But I don't think there'll be any fundamental differences for that. Now look, we're the seventh largest vocational fleet in the nation. And to Jon's point, we are the right kind of company to be innovating and to be pushing innovation onto the market. And again, when you get there, those benefits accrue in large ways because we've got 16,000 trucks on the street every day. Yes. So look, there's definitely some impact, to your point, Michael, with traffic. But look, the initial rollout of the RISE platform is the foundational element surprise. The stuff the team is working on now, the next things that they'll layer in now once the platform is rolled out and established is additive, right? So there's going to be layer after layer of additional feature benefit and capability on that digital platform that's going to drive new margin expansion and better operations, better customer-facing stuff, more information in our pricing tools and just better, safer operations. \n Jon, do you want to talk about a couple of those things? It is -- Michael, that's the point of momentum, right, when you heard me use that word, twice Jon used it, Brian, look, underlying strength in our business, sort of developmental strength in our people, resiliency in the mid-business model, again, rational backdrop and then, again, proven agility through this downturn, right, you prove it. You can't question it, right? You could see how quickly the company turned and reacted and adapted, adopted, proven agility and momentum, right? And that is the key takeaway here. I mean there is really strong momentum in the business, in the team and in all the work that's been done over recent years coming together to carry us into 2021. Yes. Look, we're not going to change the structural issue with legacy landfills, right, overall, right? I mean they're going to have that cost, maybe somebody else doesn't have. And our formula of returning cash to shareholders, the way we do is a very time-tested formula, right? We're going to continue to invest in capital even through this tough time.\n I mean, look, when we went through the Great Recession, we didn't stop investing in the business. We had strong enough cash flow to carry us. We continue to invest in fleet, all the other things. Through this year, we didn't shut it down. We actually, in some cases, accelerated some of the spending in some of the digital tools. And yes, I mean we're very strongly focused on cash flow conversion. And as I said earlier, we're going to get ahead of that 45% and going to carry us into northern 40% territory. Look at the things that Jon and Tim and the team have built momentum on. I mean look at -- we talked already about the -- changing the pricing mechanism on municipal, right, to a fair and equitable arrangement. That's underway. Recycling, making a lot of headway there. And it's not just the recycling markets that are helping us, right, they will, but we're, again, we're retooling that business, right, making it truly sustainable, right? That's happening. Now some pricing on the resi side for the elevated weights, right, all of those things.\n And then all the underlying operational benefits. I mean safety is a great story. Employee turnover is a great story. Engagement is a great story. All of those things adding up, and those are all going to come to fruition, I think, regardless of COVID. And then COVID sort of kicked this into another gear. We found new agility that we didn't have and made some other operational changes because we, frankly, had to. And those are going to carry in the future periods. Yes. Except you might have some other just recovery because certain sectors open up, that book maybe shut down, right? It might be economic, maybe construction in some places. Look, normally, seasonally, Q3 is our strongest quarter, 2 is our second strongest then 4 and then 1. Well, look, you heard Jon used this phrase, the power of the portfolio, and that's something that we speak to a lot, right? And when you spend decades and decades building the business and pulling the business together the way we did, 5 public companies, blah, blah, blah, you end up with some stuff that you got to clean up. We're kind of through all that. We've done some puts and takes in markets. We've gone to markets. We've exited markets. We used to talk about national accounts and stuff we had to shed. We're not going to be talking much about that anymore. \n Now the fact is because we have a strong pipeline in acquisitions, right, as something like Jon talked about last quarter, we're always going to have some business that comes with an acquisition that may be likely to be shed because it doesn't sort of fit the model. But overall, we think we've done a good job. We think we've got a good filter and test in place on the way in as we're selling new business with all the sales tools that have been launched over recent years. So we think we've got the safety mechanism on the organic sales side. There'll still be some stuff that maybe gets shed through -- as a result of strong M&A. \n But look, we are well positioned. Again, the power of the portfolio works. It's the mix of geographies. It's the mix of business, large-container or small. It's a strong approach with fixing a big piece of the business, which happens to be municipal. It's been kind of our nemesis with tough recycling contracts, bad escalators, that's starting the outcome around the corner here for us. And it just again shows the relentlessness of the team, as Jon already mentioned. \n So all that work, right, just adds to the strength of the portfolio. That power of the portfolio is real. Seasonality, winter events, weather events balances out when you've got a strong portfolio. And no different than the portfolio that you invest in yourself, right? We have invested in building a strong portfolio and then sticking with it and then continually improving it over time. And it's just going to -- it will just get better and better as we go. Well, look, we -- I would say this, we've been -- we've looked at every decent deal that's come around. I would say there's probably been times where we've had sort of the lead seat on some deals. And on an ROI basis, we just couldn't get as comfortable with it as we'd like, and we passed. And in a couple of cases, other people came in and decided to go forward with it. Some cases, people paid more than maybe we would have, right?\n There's a lot of really high-quality companies out there that we compete with vigorously every day, and we've got a pretty good look at who they are, how they operate. We know the good quality. Those are the companies we're talking to. We're not going to win every deal, right? I would say there tends to be a natural buyer, and that might be a cultural fit. It might be a geographic fit. It might just be where the purchasing company is in the life cycle or, frankly, what promises they've made to the market that they feel they have to keep. We're not in a situation where we're being paid some high-growth multiple and we've got to do things that are unnatural. \n So we stick to what we know. We've got a great M&A team, a great team of people out there who know their markets. Our 10-area presence all have market plans that think about how they want to expand their business through whether it's landfill expansions and acquisitions or new lines of business. All that is up and running. \n So look, I remember, when we paused M&A, when we did the big merger over a decade ago and then we put our toe back in the water, year-after-year, I've come to you and said, and we're going to do X next year. And sometimes we missed it a little bit because we've said no to some deals that proved, frankly, I'm worthy in the end. We found some things in diligence that we didn't like and we backed off. And we weren't so hot and heavy to make the number as we were to do its best for the company.\n And then there's years like this year where we're going to blow it out because opportunity arises. And these companies that we're buying today are high-quality companies and a really great fit. And that's how we're going to continue to play it. And we've taken some opportunity to expand the core a little bit. There's some great opportunity that the team has brought to us that expand our abilities in around the environmental space that we're fond of. \n So that's going to continue. And we haven't given you, again, guidance on that, and we will talk about that in February based on what the pipeline is. And  -- but when we say we're well positioned, I think you can take that to the bank. We're well positioned. Look, we're not going to give you the exact formula because there's too much mix involved, right? But look, I mean our business grows based on population growth, household formation, business formation. So very simply, more people, right, job creation, wage growth, more people working, people sort of settling down after sort of the chaos. There have been a lot of chaos this year, right, COVID, social unrest, the election. I was suffering personally from a great deal of election fatigue, okay? And so I'm sure a lot of people were, right? \n So things are going to start to settle down. America ends up conquering all in the end. How much time will it take? To your point, people have a lot of savings set aside. People are waiting to see. We have good news from the Fed today. Look, as things get back to normal, right, and we get on a path, economy recovers and people find a way to continue to sort of save and grow their businesses, as Jon mentioned, people innovate, we see it all the time, we're going to be right there with it. Our market position, it allows us to take full advantage of all that organic growth somewhat naturally. And then our ability to grow through M&A, our ability to look at even expanding some of our core offerings, a lot of good there. \n And so we're well positioned. Strong balance sheet, strong asset base, strong market position, strong team, I can go on and on and on and brag about this group. So this quarter is a great showing of all the hard work that's been going on. And I said strength, resilience and now an expression of agility and real momentum in the business. And with a good backdrop, I think now, as things start to settle down around us, then it will be a good story to tell. And we'll be here in February to share with you the full year results and the outlook for '21 in more detail. And based on what we see today, I think everyone will be pretty happy with that. Thank you, Chad. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and continue to have a positive outlook on our business. We delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth, expanded EBITDA margin and achieved EBITDA margin performance above 30%. We raised our full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance, and we see strong free cash flow growth in 2021. Once again, we have proved the resiliency of our business and the strength of our model. \n I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hard work, commitment and dedication exhibited by our 36,000 team members this year. At the onset of COVID, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize our frontline employees who deliver an essential service to our communities across the country each and every day. And since then, their dedication has continued. Even through record-setting weather events, including fires and hurricanes and, frankly, you name it, they've never let up. And it's their consistency and willingness to take care of our customers, communities and each other that makes them truly relentless and makes me proud to work for Republic Services. \n I hope you all have a good evening. Stay safe out there."

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 230 basis points to 30.3% in the third quarter. The components of margin expansion included 70 basis points of improvement from favorable net fuel and higher recycled commodity prices and 160 basis points of improvement from the underlying business. Margin expansion in the underlying business was broad-based, and nearly all operating expenses improved compared to the prior year. \n Additionally, SG&A as a percent of revenue was 10%, an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year. Our performance reflects cost controls put in place and reductions in nonessential spending while continuing to make investments for the future to ensure the long-term health of our business. \n Although we're not providing specific EBITDA margin guidance, I'd like to remind you that there's a 50 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter due to the timing of CNG tax credits. Even with this headwind, we expect EBITDA margin to be at or above fourth quarter 2019 performance. This would result in full year margin expansion and exceed our original full year EBITDA margin guidance that we provided back in February. \n Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Free cash flow growth was driven by an increase in earnings and improvements in working capital.\n The contribution from working capital includes a 1.5-day improvement in DSO, a 2-day improvement in DPO and $68 million of deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act. It's important to note that even without the benefit of the payroll tax deferral, adjusted free cash flow would be up nearly 7% compared to the prior year.\n Cash collections remain strong. We believe our DSO performance reflects our customers' willingness to pay for the high-quality service we provide and the essential nature of our business. As Don mentioned, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. It's important to note that this level of performance assumes over $1.2 billion of capital expenditures, which is an increase from our prior guidance and relatively consistent with the level of spend we contemplated in our original guidance back in February.\n While we have already achieved over 90% of this full year guide, it should be noted that certain expenditures are back-end loaded. During the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately 70% of our full year cash taxes, receive approximately 1/3 of our full year capital expenditures and anniversary the benefit from DSO and DPO improvements. \n Our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance assumes we will defer approximately $100 million under the CARES Act in 2020. However, if our performance is trending at or above the high end of our guidance range, it is highly likely we would repay the deferred taxes early.\n During the quarter, total debt was $8.8 billion, and total liquidity increased to $3.4 billion. This includes our new 364-day credit facility. Our leverage ratio was approximately 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. \n Interest expense in the third quarter was $89 million and included $17 million of noncash amortization expense. During the quarter, we refinanced our 2021 bonds to capitalize on the low interest rate environment. This will reduce cash interest by approximately $22 million per year, which we'll begin to realize in the fourth quarter. \n Our adjusted income tax provision was $75 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19%. Together with the $8 million charge from solar investments, we had a total tax-related impact of $83 million during the quarter or 21% of adjusted earnings before taxes. The charge related to solar investments is recorded as a loss from unconsolidated investments on our income statement.\n The 21% all-in rate was less than our statutory rate of 27%, which resulted in an EPS benefit of approximately $0.08 during the quarter. We expect an all-in tax-related impact of 27% of EBT in the fourth quarter, which will be made up of the income tax provision and charges from solar investments. \n Let me now turn the call over to Jon to provide some initial thoughts on 2021. Yes. And to Jon's point, Hamzah, that's the real leverage, right? So if you're expanding both, that's why we believe that we're going to be able to grow free cash flow by improving free cash flow margin at a greater rate than we're increasing earnings. $100 million, Tyler. Yes. No, you're right, it's $150 million. Starting point to end point headwind we're overcoming and still achieving the high single-digit free cash flow growth. Yes. And I think you saw, Walter, in my remarks, I talked about spending a similar level of CapEx this year as we originally guided. Even though we've got lower volumes, a lot of that is because we're investing more in this digital transformation. And we think that based on the benefits we've seen so far, that there's much more to come, and that's why we're trying to accelerate that spend. Yes. And one of the things we had mentioned last quarter what the impact was from education. And if you take a look in the third quarter, it was about 20% of our small-container decline was due to education alone. You're talking about for the full year, 30%? Yes. Look, I think you do have to take into consideration, Jon mentioned it, right, there are certainly some things that are happening in the macro environment, right, things that are helping productivity, some of the lighter container weights. So there are some puts and takes. But we do feel that 30% margin, an improvement towards 30% margin is something that's in the near term, right? And it's going to be something that we're going to continue to move toward. '21 might have a little bit of noise in it just because you have some of those macro benefits modulating. But after that, certainly, 30-plus basis points a year is something that's certainly achievable. Hey, Michael, one thing I just wanted to kind of clarify that, too, is that when we talk about the 160 basis points, call it, at the underlying business, that's not just solid waste, that also includes the impact from environmental services. So the only thing that doesn't include of the 230 basis points of total margin expansion is the impact of both net fuel and higher commodity prices had on margin expansion. No. We expect margins to expand. We're not giving a guide on that topic, but we are expecting margins to expand. Right. And that's why I was saying, Michael, as I made those comments about both the combination of EBITDA margin expansion and being able to reduce expenditures, that combination is why we feel that there's going to be an accelerating event here on free cash flow conversion to drive that free cash flow growth. Yes. They were -- in the third quarter, it was down about 10% overtime hours year-over-year. Well, if you think about seasonality, typically, what you see is an uptick in the second and primarily the third. So from a seasonal perspective, then you start to see it kind of come down in the fourth quarter. So your toughest bogey is generally the third quarter hit from a year-over-year perspective when you talk about seasonal volumes. So there typically isn't something that increases significantly in the fourth quarter from a volume perspective when you look at Q3 to Q4. Yes. And 1, right. So we don't see certainly any headwinds as we look in the fourth quarter from a seasonal perspective year-over-year versus what we just went through in the third quarter. Yes. With that $850 million to $900 million investment that we guided to, again, it's going to be very heavily back-end loaded. We would expect, call it, 150 basis points plus of acquisition rollover on the top line. Yes. They were somewhat flattish from September levels, but about a 100 basis point improvement from the Q3 average. Yes. So within the 160 of expansion, overall, there was a 20 basis point headwind from the environmental services business. Yes. In the fourth quarter, yes. Yes, probably at a similar level, if you will. Correct. Yes."

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.\nDon Slager: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased with our second quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the resiliency of our business, the power of our operating model and the strength of our cash flow. We delivered strong results in the second quarter by leveraging the solid foundation we built over the last decade. During the quarter we increased adjusted earnings per share, delivered double-digit growth and adjusted free cash flow and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points to 29.6%. I'm proud of the results the team delivered and truly inspired by their dedication to the Republic way. Our leaders are working tirelessly to keep our people safe, adjust our operations to changing demand and ensure consistent, reliable service to our customers. Our front-line employees continue to show every day for customers and each other and our support personnel quickly adjusted to new way of working. It was the collective effort of all 36,000 employees that delivered these results. Our economic outlook is positive. Since April, total volume has increased month-over-month through July. In our small container business, we are seeing a similar volume trend. Additionally, container weights increased sequentially through July indicating steady improvement in consumption and economic activity. As always, we are running our business for the long-term and continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience, improve the efficiency of our operations and strengthen our market position. These investments will position us well for future growth. In the second quarter, we continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to shareholders. Year-to-today we've invested $124 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and grow free cash flow. Our deal pipeline continues to be strong and we remain on track to invest $600 million to $650 million in acquisitions this year. In July, our board approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend. The consistent growth in the dividend demonstrates the stability and predictability of our cash flows as well as our confidence in delivering future cash flow growth and year-to-today we've returned $99 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and have approximately $600 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We now have greater clarity on how the pandemic impacts our business and how we can continue to adjust operations and effectively manage spending. As a result, we are reinstating our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.175 billion. Our ability to achieve the low-end of our original free cash flow guidance, demonstrates the tenacity of our team, the flexibility of our operating model and the strength and stability of our free cash flow. As an essential service provider, we play a critical role in our communities. This starts by providing uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances and being a responsible and ethical partner in the community. This quarter we were recognized for our efforts and were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the first time. For this list, 1,000 of the largest US public companies were evaluated and ranked based on transparency and performance across 141 environmental, social and governance factors. Lastly, we recently published our 2019 sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making on our most significant opportunities to positively impact our customers, employees, communities, shareholders and the environment. I would encourage you to give it a look, it's a great read. Now call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks Don. In the second quarter, we remain focused on our priorities putting our people first, keeping our facilities running smoothly and taking care of our customers. By staying focused on these priorities, we successfully executed our plan and delivered strong financial and operational results. These results clearly demonstrate we're well-positioned to come out of this pandemic stronger and better than before. As expected, revenue decreased in the quarter due to customer's temporarily suspending or reducing service levels. Volume decreased 7.4% versus the prior year. The volume decline was steepest in April and sequentially improved throughout the quarter. In April, total volume decreased 10.2%. In Just, volume improved to a 5.4% decline versus the prior year. The decline in volume and pace of recovery varies by line of business and by market. Landfill special waste volume was impacted the most, decreasing 17% versus the prior year. Special waste volumes were down 22% in April and in June were down 13%. The decrease in special waste volume was primarily due to jobs being deferred, not canceled and the pipeline remained strong. In the second quarter, landfill MSW volume decreased 3.5% and landfill C&D volume was essentially flat. Second quarter small container volume decreased by 8.8%. In April, small container volume was down 10.5%. By June volume sequentially improved 300 basis points and was down 7.5% versus the prior year. Second quarter large container volume decreased 12.4%. In April, large container volume was down 17.3% and by June volume was down 7.2% versus the prior year. We expect volume to continue to recover over the remainder of the year. During the quarter we weigh contractual terms to support our customers in their time of need. We made pausing and resuming service simple and easy. We waived late fees and offered flexible payment plans to our most loyal customers in need of assistance. Our results demonstrate that customers appreciate our efforts and value our service. Our net promoter score increased nine point from the prior year and we maintained our customer churn of 7%. Additionally, we successfully executed our pricing program to cover our cost and inflation. This enabled us to continue to deliver the essential services we provide while being mindful of the challenges our customers faced. Total core price was 4.7%. This included open market pricing of 5.5% and restricted pricing of 3.4%. Core price represents price increases to our same-store customers net of rollbacks. Average yield was 2.5%. Average yields measures the changes -- the change in average price per unit and taken into account the impact of customer churn. Thanks for the team's relentless efforts, we effectively managed our cost and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin a 170 basis point versus the prior year. Due to our investments in innovative routing and workforce planning tools, we were able to quickly adjust our routes for changes in demand. This enabled us to reduce over time by 25% versus the prior year and increase productivity across our entire collection business. For example, in our large container line of business, productivity improved approximately 230 basis points. Throughout the quarter our drivers remain engaged and focused. Attendance remained at all-time high and turnover was at multiyear lows. We all decreased safety-related expenses by 19% or 13 basis point of revenue -- 30 basis points of revenue compared to the prior year. We achieved the best safety performance in the company's history, reducing safety incidences by approximately 20% versus the prior year. During the quarter, we continue to partner with our municipal customers and discuss the impact of COVID on our business. In the second quarter, residential weights were up 10.1% versus the prior year. Weights tapered down during the quarter and by June, residential weights were up 7.6% versus the prior year. We also continue to renegotiate contracts with favorable pricing terms. We now have $850 million of annual revenue or 34% of our CPI based book of business tied to a waste index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. Next, turning to environmental services, during the quarter, environmental services revenue decreased 26% from the prior year. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and a delay of in-plant project work. The decrease in environmental services revenue resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. We expect this headwind to continue in the second half of the year. Turning to recycling, during the second quarter, recycled commodity prices increased 29% to $101 per ton compared to $78 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher cycle commodity prices was partially offset by 11% decrease in inbound recycling volume. Finally, preliminary results for July indicate total revenue increased approximately 1.5% from June. We typically see July revenue increase from June due to seasonality. Total revenue in July was down approximately 3% from the prior year. For reference purposes, total revenue in June was down 3.5% from the prior year. With that, I will now to the call over to Brian.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $743 million an increase of approximately 20% over the prior year. Free cash flow growth was driven by an improvement in working capital, which was partially offset by a $51 million increase in capital expenditures when compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditures demonstrates our commitment to invest throughout the pandemic, which will protect and improve the long-term health of our business. The contribution from working capital includes a one-day improvement in DSL, a two-day improvement in DPO and a $35 million payroll tax deferral under the Cares Act. We expect a total payroll tax deferral of approximately $100 million in 2020, which will flip over the next two years. To date cash collections have remained strong. We believe our DSO performance reflects our customer's willingness to pay with a high quality service we provide and the essential nature of our business. We expect the working capital benefit from DSO and DPO to anniversary in the second half of the year since we saw improvement in these metrics in the latter part of 2019. With respect to EBITDA margin, the 170 basis points of expansion over the prior year included 110 basis points of improvement from favorable net fuel and higher recycled commodity price and 60 basis points of improvement in the underlying business. The business absorbed $31 million of COVID-related costs during the quarter. These costs related to the investment made in our commitment-to-serve initiative to recognize our front-line employees and support our small business customers, additional PPE and enhanced facility cleaning to help keep our people safe and supplemental paid time off and enhanced medical benefits for employees and their families. EBITDA margin expansion resulted from reducing operating and SG&A cost by a combined $151 million or 8%. This completely offset the $151 million or 5.8% decline in revenue. Most of the cost reductions resulted from effective cost management that positively impacted nearly all P&L line items. Our focus on cost control will enable us to gain leverage on volume growth as demand returns. Some of the cost improvement resulted from macroeconomic factors that positively impacted results. For example, transfer and disposal costs were down 80 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower container weights in our small container business. Container weights were at their lowest level in April and progressively got heavier throughout the quarter. While we are not providing specific EBITDA margin guidance, we expect second half margin to be at or slightly above the second half of last year. This would result in full year margin expansion. During the quarter, total debt decreased to $8.7 billion and total liquidity increased to $2.3 billion. Interest expense in the second quarter was $92 million and included $16 million of non-cash amortization. Our leverage ratio was approximately three times.. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.1% and in line with our expectations. Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reinstating full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion $1.175 billion. This guidance assumes continued gradual improvement in economic activity through the remainder of the year. And with that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: I guess I would like to start with that great color you gave in July on down 3% and then down 3.5% the month before. If you're seeing that trend and take into consideration seasonality, is there anything to suggest that you wouldn't be into positive growth territory year-over-year by the end of the year?\nDon Slager: As we said right, we have a positive outlook on the trend right and we feel good about a couple of things. One, residential weight increases have stabilized right and now small container weights are resuming right. So again strength of American business, consumption rates, the consumer we think is getting stronger, people are adjusting to a new way of doing things, you see that all around you right. So we've a very positive outlook. Exactly when it will go positive, we can't put our finger on that and so the guidance we give is around cash flow which we think is strong. We chose in April, we thought we know saw a scenario we can catch by the end of range and now we're telling you we're even more confident than that and all the trends are positive and Jon gave you a lot of great trends on cost management and CapEx and people paying their bills the whole nine yards so to speak. So when it goes positive we'll have more full year in the next quarter and hopefully that will be another good news story we can share with everybody.\nWalter Spracklin: Absolutely trends are certainly in the right direction here but I guess now looking out a little further, I am not asking for guidance here, but just conceptually, you did a great job of managing costs on the way down so that margin expansion in fact occurred. Is there anything to suggest that as volume comes back through the rest of the year, you look out to 2021 and assuming we have hopefully knock on wood here, we have a macro situation with a lot more normalcy to it, is it not out of the question that margin enhancement here as volumes come back, could be quite substantial given how well you were able to in fact improve margins on the way down.\nJon Vander Ark: Let me give you a couple of thoughts there. So there were certainly some macroeconomic benefits that we realized. In the second quarter we kind of talked about that. So for example some of the things we saw around container weight, we would expect those to -- those benefits I would say to moderate as we look forward, but I'd say that being said, we do expect to be more profitable as we look for, we've learned things about ourselves on how we can operate differently, one within cost of operations as well as within SG&A and we would expect those benefits to accrue to the P&L in future periods.\nDon Slager: Right like Jon mentioned, safety is a bright spot, employee engagement is at all-time high. We expect that to continue. We're still doing great work to take care of our front-line people. But look the acquisition pipeline being full we're talking about tuck-ins obviously we're tucking in into current markets that's a margin enhancement in and of its own. We talk about running business for the long term and sort of the depths of COVID, we were busy adapting to new wave of doing business, but we're back at long-term planning in the business. Jon and his team are still rolling out the RISE platform across the organization, the digital tools. We're well underway there. So we're back at it and all of those things are going to be margin enhancers as we go forward. So there's a lot of good news we'll be talking about here as we get ahead this next couple of quarters off.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey Jon, so I know there's been a lot of chatter out there about rural versus large urban market. I think you guys are about a third, a third, a third rural franchise and urban. You gave some great color in aggregate on volume trends but is there any way you could kind of bifurcate urban versus maybe those small-market if even anecdotally, just basically is there a big difference going on in those different types of markets?\nJon Vander Ark: It's very geographic to your point Tyler. We've looked at a lot of productivity data and circumstance to understand, we love traffic obviously, we're more efficient in getting the recycling in the garbage off the ground and surprisingly we're seeing pretty steady trend across both rural and urban markets and you think you get a much bigger advantage in urban markets and we're seeing kind of the same advantage across all of those markets which to Brian's earlier point gives us some confidence that some of the cost that we've captured on the way down, we're going to keep that on the way back in those productivity improvements and I wouldn\u2019t -- again we haven\u2019t -- we're not releasing this data, but I haven\u2019t seen dramatic differences between urban, suburban and rural right in terms of the activity levels in volume.\nTyler Brown: That's extremely helpful. Hey Brian just a quick clarification on CapEx. So I think coming into this year, you guys were looking for some heightened spend I think on breakthroughs and such. I think that's stemmed all the way back from the tax bill. First off, is that's the case and did you make that spend and number two, I know 2021 is a long way away, but should we be thinking about that incremental spend peeling off in '21?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah so Tyler of the original $100 million that we were spending it's probably going to be $60 million. So $40 million of that will roll into 2021.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just my last one here if I can, so Don you were reiterated that you plan to spend $650 million. I think you\u2019ve done I think you said $125 million year-to-date or so. Is the preponderance of that $0.5 billion sitting in one property, are there more kind of multiple sizable deals out there?\nDon Slager: Yeah, there is one big deal out there right that we've talked about but there are some others. Again I continue to say look there are a number of really nice companies out there well run and good markets, good people getting to a place in their life cycle where talking those makes sense. We're engaged in some other good conversations. So we've a lot of confidence in the pipeline, but there is one big deal out there that will carry forward for that.\nJon Vander Ark: I think one of the bright spots for this is when we explode down pricing deals right in the decline here I understand what demand was going to happen. We never stopped conversation and our acquisition pipeline remains very robust, very active and we now are starting to write deals with sellers as we've got a lot more confident in our outlook and there's and feel really confident going forward for the rest of this year and next year in terms of that one.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey good afternoon. First of all congratulations Brian on the CFO role. My first question is you talked about second-half margins being slightly above last year and I realize you even have some costs that come back into the system as container weights get heavier etcetera, but maybe could you talk about what you see as sort of permanent cost saves during COVID-19 anything sort of structurally that you think you can take out of your business whether it be realistic footprint or maybe there's other stuff that maybe you can talk about that may be more permanent in nature?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah I'll give you three Hamzah, real estate is certainly one of them and we're reevaluating what roles should always be in the office, what roles can be permanently at home and what roles will have some flexibility to them and therefore we capture real estate savings on the ones that home or the ones that are flexible. I think travel is another one, the tools that we use to work remotely, we have spent far more connected and efficient than we expected. There will be roles, there is a role for travel going forward. So operating completely virtual is not a norm that we'll have but we'll certainly be spending less on T&E as we go forward, as we kind of think about that's both worlds. And then just in terms of labor productivity, I think our ability to flex labor and move people cross-train, move people across different lines of business has allowed us to serve customers really well as well as manage cost the same time and we'll certainly carry some of those forward as we recover from the pandemic.\nHamzah Mazari: And then just on pricing, I know a lot of the pricing is already locked in, in Q1 and I'm not asking you to comment on your competitor, but they had much lower average yield and maybe we're giving more price relief. Could you just maybe talk about how you were able to keep pricing pretty steady as well as in the face of really down volume. Maybe just talk about your pricing tools and how you see pricing build up for the balance of the year or you expect it to be pretty consistent.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. So we look at a range of options. Obviously, they're given with an unprecedented event and definitely want to be empathetic to customers who were their businesses were changing dramatically. So as I talked about, we let people break contracts to suspend service. And were in constant communication with them about when they could come back at a time that was right for them. We were flexible on payment terms with some of our customers and certainly offered that too many more, that didn't take us up on it, and then spent a lot of time and energy on committed reserve. So we put money in the hands of our frontline people to serve our customers. So our philosophy was that customers while they maybe need a little cost relief, what they really needed is customers and revenue, when we got our local teams engaged and energized to power our small business customers through a very difficult time and got a lot of positive feedback from our customers on that front and listen, we are out there every day in a tough environment, picking up the recycling and the garbage and doing a hard job and our customers are noticing it, and they're paying us a fair price for the hard work that we're doing. So I think that's the primary reason we've been able to sustain it. And going forward, I think we see more of the same obviously, there's some puts and takes in terms of year-over-year and some fees that might change year-over-year, but the philosophy is not changing. And we expect a strong pricing performance in the second half.\nDon Slager: Look, they\u2019re paying us a fair price, and they're paying us on time. And I think to Jon's point, I think they value the service, and rewarding us for the hard work and the effort our frontline people are putting out so.\nHamzah Mazari: Got you. And I just have a last clarification question. That's very helpful. The $600 million to $650 million in M&A, is that a new normal going forward for you guys, it used to be a lot smaller, but you're seeing your peers do a lot more transactions. And so has the philosophy changed at all? Or this is just sort of a time where you're just seeing much more in the pipeline, and then it goes back to sort of a normalized, I think it was, maybe it was $300 million of annual deals used to do?\nDon Slager: Well, I think, even Jon just said, with the pipeline, not only strong for the remainder of the year, the $600 million to $650 million range, we've given what we think is strong into next year. So do I have an outlook for the next 10 years, I don't, but I would tell you just based on where we are, in this point of history again, there's a lot of great companies out there. We know where they are, who they are, we have ongoing conversations, we think that a sort of a robust pipeline of deals and a continued appetite for good deals, good companies is going to be somewhat of a regular diet for us, at least into the future here, we can see and certainly, we have the appetite, we have the ability and the team continues to demonstrate their ability to very efficiently integrate these things. And after we get everything up to start a company standard really turn into cash flow on that, we think that generate. And as we look back at the deals we've done, we've got a high degree of confidence in what they've delivered. So we know that, we're paying the right price for deals and making the right assumptions on the way in. So it gives us all more competence to keep ongoing.\nHamzah Mazari: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Maguire: Hi, good afternoon. And like everybody's congratulations on the nice quarter, solid job managing the cost there.\nDon Slager: Thank you, Brian.\nBrian Maguire: Just on the -- back on the margin outlook. There's one thing I'm trying to reconcile is 2Q is the worst for volumes down 7.5% or so and the best for year-over-year margin and volumes are getting better on a year-over-year comp basis for the rest of the year, it sounds like but the margin gains aren't getting there quite as good as it, is that really as simple as a recycling fuel kind of contribution sort of going away and maybe a little bit from a higher container weight or other some other puts and takes, some factors in there?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I would sit there and say it's what you just mentioned quite honestly. So from where fuel prices are right now, we think sequentially that steps down about 40 basis points. So starting with our 29.6 in the second quarter, there would be a sequential decline of 40 basis points. And then commodity prices would be another 20, right. So you're already down 60 basis points just with those two, and I talked about the container weight, right. And we saw those lighter by 20% in April, and actually by July, that's down to about 6%. So that benefit that we enjoyed in the second quarter, we don't expect that to repeat at the same level, going forward. But quite honestly, while it's a near-term cost headwind, it's actually a good sign, right. It's a really good sign for the health of our small business customer.\nNicole Giandinoto: And Brian, the other thing to keep in mind, if you recall when the CNG tax credit was passed, we recognized two years worth of benefits in the fourth quarter of 2019. And so that is giving us a headwind for example, in the fourth quarter of 50 basis point headwinds. So about call it 30 for the second half.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, so that's something we have to overcome.\nBrian Maguire: Got it, so we\u2019re talking about our second half margin, it is cumulative number, so your 3Q could be quite a bit better, but 4Q will have that unique headwind like?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, which is just a timing thing.\nBrian Maguire: Yes, thanks. And then, just a question on capital reallocation with the outlook being a little bit better and be able to get back to providing guidance? Do you think we get back to buying shares back more periodically, like the closure around beforehand? Or is it a little too early to be thinking about reopening that window?\nJon Vander Ark: Look as I said, we've got $600 million remaining on the authorization, we continue to look at the intrinsic value of the business. Again, we look at that based on our three-year outlook and our three-year plan, right. So we're looking at real actionable plan against what, how we think the stock will perform. You look at our track record, we've always taken a balanced approach with that intrinsic mindset. At the same time, we've said look we will flex buyback based on opportunity in the market as it relates to M&A and maintain the optimal leverage ratio of call it right around three times and so all those things are in play. We've got a lot of flexibility. We got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. So we're in a good place. And if the market allows it and we see an opportunity, we'll buy opportunistically just as we have. And frankly, I think we'd beat the market year-in and year-out. So the balanced approach won't change. But we'll continue to look to put our money to work and return to shareholder is the best way that we can, we think we do it as efficiently as anybody.\nBrian Maguire: Okay and just last one for me, just back on the pricing outlook, it sounds like we saw a little bit of a step down in the year-over-year growth rate, which was expected I think just as the year progresses, the comps get a little bit tougher on a year-over-year basis. Should we just expect a little bit more gradual depletion in that line item?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, it\u2019s gradual. Again, there's some timing things year-over-year. So some of our fees are impacted by fuel declines. There's a year-over-year decline on that, but our core pricing philosophy is not changing. We want to send a fair price with the hard work that we do, and customers reward and value that and pay us.\nBrian Maguire: Got you. Thanks Jon. All right, congrats again. Have a great quarter.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKyle White: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, hey Jon, thank you for the details regarding how borrowings progressed through the quarter and the details on total revenue in July, but curious if you could kind of give similar level of details on how borrowings were in July by line of business, how a small container and roll-off and such?\nJon Vander Ark: No, we're not giving that level of detail on July. But steady recovery across that, and I would say that we have a little bit of a geographic headwind that we've had to overcome as the COVID cases initially started out in the Northeast and we're heavily impacted, or we have a lighter footprint, the heavier caseload in the last couple of months has been in the South and Southwest. So Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arizona, California, we have significant market positions in all of those markets. And yet we're still seeing volumes recover. So that gives us a lot of optimism. But the outlook is positive. There's still uncertainty of course, there's going to be puts and takes across different geographies. And week-to-week, we're running the business for the long-term, but we feel like we certainly far more than exceeded the floor, and we're on our way to a nice day recovery.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: I think in Jon's prepared remarks, he mentioned seasonality, right. So we actually are seeing some seasonality in the business. And so with all that Jon just mentioned overcoming what's happening out there again, that leads us to our positive outlook.\nKyle White: Got you, that's helpful and apologies if I missed this and appreciate the free cash flow guidance provided, but did you provide any other kind of moving parts there? What do you expect the CapEx for the full-year, what about working capital?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, we actually in our guidance, we provided the various components including, what we expect from a cash from operations as well as our CapEx. So you can actually see the various components in our 8-K filing. If you kind of take the midpoint of the range though, what we're kind of thinking, it's approximately $1.1 billion of CapEx.\nJon Vander Ark: And the only thing I will add about, our CapEx plan is naturally pulls back when we don't have the volume, 10% of our annual CapEx typically is for volume growth. And we're not seeing that growth, we're naturally not going to spend that CapEx, what we see decline in some of our replacement schedules for trucks naturally push out, we're still investing in the business. We're still working on projects, still investing in our digital operations platform which is rise and run the business for the long-term. So the team's done a great job in the face of a pandemic, not just working the quarter but working for our multi-year plan.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Again it just reiterates the flexibility we have in the business model, when these things happen, we've got the ability to flex very quickly and still produce the cash flow and meet our obligations. So again, I think it\u2019s the great outcome of a lot of great work from the team. But again, it just really shines right light and conversely, the business model is.\nJon Vander Ark: And Kyle as I mentioned, the midpoint of right around $1.1 billion, the range is $1.075 billion to $1.15 billion.\nKyle White: Perfect, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean, your line maybe muted on your end.\nSean Eastman: Hey, sorry about that guys. I'm at my mom's house. So just kind of keep it quiet. So guys really impressive job. Congratulations. I just wanted to ask sort of a higher level question. I mean post-COVID it does seem like we could see pockets of population growth in pretty different parts of the country, relative to what we've seen over the last many years. So I'm just wondering, whether that or anything else sort of in the post-COVID world is changing, how you guys are prioritizing or focusing your capital investment dollars or M&A dollars. And any thoughts there would be great.\nDon Slager: So look, our strategy around market position hasn't changed, right. We strive to be number one or number two in the markets we serve, we strive to be vertically integrated. And again, the results you see there are result of decades of building around that pillar of our strategy. We want to get in front of the growth, right. We want to be where people are. And so when you think about the Sunbelt that we talked about from Portland, Seattle, Washington, down the coast across Texas, up into the Carolinas, and all the little pockets that people are moving into hotspots like Nashville, right, we're there. We've got a great business mix, a great business portfolio of urban centers which sort of picks-up some of the growth around sort of the urbanization trend. We've got a great business position in secondary markets, right. And so look, you won't see especially winder in the markets. We're not in and do startups, just because they're hotspots for people. But if we can take a number one or number two position in an adjacent market that we're not in currently but next door or brand new market, we'll do that. And we've done that, we've done that over the last couple of years, you've seen us go into some, some new secondary markets because we were able to take a nice position. So again, we've got a great pipeline, we've got a great M&A team, a great leader in that group. And again, we've got the balance sheet to continue to grow that way. Great thing about our business, again as population grows, as business formation grows around that, we're very well situated with our portfolio and the fact that we're East and West and North and South kind of insulates us when they're sort of micro pockets of bad news, right. So while there may be a couple of cities right now where the epidemic still on the upswing where plenty of cities where the numbers are going the other way, and so we're getting that balanced benefit. So again, that's the strength of the portfolio, the power of the portfolio. And so one thing that will change in our outlook is just as Jon said, I mean, we've learned a lot on how we can work a little differently. And we're taking all those lessons to heart, that will make us better. It'll make us even more attractive company to work for. It'll make our employees even more engaged. It'll make us leaner. But it won't change our outlook on how we grow. And again, I think we're very well situated for all of that.\nSean Eastman: Yes, that makes sense. Good answer. And next, I just wanted to give Brian the floor. I mean, congrats on the CFO role. Just curious, over the next 12 months, where you think you're going to be spending the biggest chunk of your time from an operational perspective, what's the big priority as you come into the big seat here?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Well, look, I mean I think the traditional role of the CFO, when you just think about making sure that we have good quality financials, I mean going to be spending obviously my time on that, but even more so when you think about me keeping right the IT department and when we think about our investments in technology, how they're enabling things like our platform, how they're doing things, quite honestly, even on the SG&A and when we think about modernizing our core systems, that's where I'm going to be spending the majority of my time, just to make sure that we set ourselves up well for future growth and enhance profitability.\nSean Eastman: Got it. I appreciate the time and nice work again.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Okay, thanks.\nDon Slager: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. On the call, you mentioned that you're questioning your own real estate footprint. I'm wondering do you have an opinion on the near-term outlook for commercial construction in general and how that might influence your business into 2021?\nDon Slager: Not a strong one given the uncertainty, only that construction has held up pretty well, right if you think about right? If you had you at C&D tons into our landfill or we printed a pretty strong quarter there. And I think in many markets construction has been the bright spot and everything else was shut down and people are sheltering in place. In most markets construction had an exemption. And really strong obviously on the residential side, right construction, probably a lot of current projects getting finished, but we're still seeing new activity in market, so probably too early to tell in terms of the longer-term outlook.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, one thing I would add to that is I\u2019m hearing a lot of people talk about, how they'll use space differently, not necessarily having less space, but having more open space and having more space between cubicles and I know for us for a long time, we need more office space, so we went from the 10 by 8 cubicle to the 8 by 8 cubicle to the 6 by 6 cubicle and just to sort of squeeze people in. So I've heard that from a number of companies that they're going to use this opportunity to maybe maintain some of the space they have and just make it more wide open, more, more sunlight for their people, more meeting space that's required that kind of thing and just to appeal to the next generation of workforce, so I think that's going to be true for a lot of people.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, thank you. And then D&A and tax rate expectations for the full-year 2020. If you didn't give those and then somewhat related the July revenue, month-to-month increase of 1.5. Do you just tell us what the normal seasonality ranges from June to July?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: That's a pretty typical of what we say.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, yes.\nNicole Giandinoto: And then as far as tax rate goes, our assumptions haven't changed from the original guidance that we provided. So we're looking for the full-year\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate of 21%. And then just keep in mind, we also have a tax related non-cash dollar charge that shows up below operating income. We expect that charge to be about $110 million and waited to the fourth quarter.\nDavid Manthey: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Thanks. Hi, Don, Jon, Bill welcome back.\nDon Slager: Hi, Michael.\nJon Vander Ark: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: I'd like to tease out the free cash flow outlook as they lay the pieces out and I think about your typical ratios like you've been tracking at 40%, 42% conversion ratio, your cash flow from ops are 22%, 23% of revenues just sort of teasing all those pieces together to try and figure out what was going on, it feels like this should be better than 11 to 175. So what's our headwinds in the second half, you gave a couple of them earlier, to take if only to give about $4 million of incremental free cash to be at the midpoint?\nDon Slager: Yeah Michael, let me give you a couple of numbers here right. So I talked about in my prepared remarks that we expect the working capital benefit to flip in the second half of the year and quite honestly that's just because we saw really strong DSO and DPO performance in the second half of 2019. So it's not expect that we expect those to step down in the current year. It's just going to anniversary. So we no longer enjoy that working capital benefit in the second half. The real big deal is the cash taxes. So when you take a look at what we expect to spend in cash taxes in the second half, it's over $100 million more than what we spent in the first half. The other thing I'll just point out is just because we had some refunds in the prior year, we would expect cash taxes to at least $100 million more on a full-year basis than in 2019 and just to your final point, cash tax as a percent of provision was about 12% last year, this year we're expecting to be about 70%.\nMichael Hoffman: 17% or 70%?\nDon Slager: 70%. Hey Michael did we mentioned that we reinstated our original free cash flow guidance?\nMichael Hoffman: I know the original guidance is actually $100 million on the upper end, on the higher end. So it feels like maybe that's not actually out of reach.\nDon Slager: Well look, nothing is ever out of reach. How's that?\nMichael Hoffman: Are the ratios I talked about still consistent kind of 40% to 42% of EBITDA or 22% to 23% of cash flow from ops as a present to revenues? Is that the way to think about thing?\nDon Slager: Yeah that's fair and again I think the big impact theirs is just going to be cash taxes with what you're seeing at that 50-plus conversion that we're seeing in the first half versus what a more normalized rate would be.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it and just to close on the acquisition type text $450 million, so that leaves to $200 million to do tuck-in that's kind of what you've spent consistently for decades is $200 million tuck in.\nDon Slager: Yeah I don't know your question unless you're just emphatically agreeing with me but\u2026\nMichael Hoffman: I just feel like there is some confusion and I'm like there is not any confusion.\nDon Slager: Look back through all the years you've known us, we have a really good track record of telling what we're going to do and then doing what we say and we wouldn't tell you what we're telling you if we didn\u2019t have a pretty good handle on it right. So we're very committed to growing through acquisitions but I can't say enough about the team that we have in place. The person leads that team, the amount of time that we spent talking about it and the amount of great companies that we see out there. So we're in that game and we're going to continue to make intelligent investments in growing our business, expanding our business that way and that's going to be, we'll be right in the hunt along with anyone else and hopefully because of relationships because of our style, because of our ability to get things done we'll get more than our fair share.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead/\nMichael Feniger: And Don if you could take a step back for very long time, there was the goal for public to get back to its prior peak margins in that 30% to 31% range, it's been out there for a while and some investors were frustrated, they didn't know if the maintenance and one fleet these initiatives were actually going to benefit. I think put up this quarter and I know that like Brian said it's macroeconomic driven, but focusing on retainer weights, but Don maybe you can kind of talk about how you think about those margin targets? We haven\u2019t heard about that in a while. The maintenance expenses seem like it's really under control this quarter landfill cost, I am just curious how you view this quarter in the context of getting and what you guys talk about the market on a full year basis this year in the context of those prior peak margins?\nDon Slager: Sure let me start by stating that the 30% margin goal is still very much in our minds and very, very real. There are two main things that have sort of in our nemesis there. One was the CPI escalator built into all of our contracts for decades that we've been overcoming and John mentioned in his remarks the great progress that the team has made in moving away from that archaic element of our contract into something that is more relevant and the teams are doing a great job there. And so that's just another way of showing that once remind something we move the needle, we move the market. We did that with the recovery fee, we're doing it now with alternative index and then the other thing that's our nemesis is recycling right and again we have really put a stake in the ground here. We talk about recycling measure we're second 2.0, the team has made an incredible improvement in progress in moving off all the old way of pricing and sharing in the risk and getting that risk appropriately balanced and that's more to come. So not only are we getting it done with our customers, because our customers value what we do and are willing to pay and understand the fairness of it, but the market is moving right. We're seeing that become more and more of a norm because it's just common sense to do it that way and so again and as that -- as those two things continue to shift as we close the gaps on that alternative index and on the recycling sharing arrangement, those by themselves go a long way toward getting us to 30%. Now just those two things and again if you look at the progress just trend them out in and the team is fighting hard and Jon is committed his eye and to get that done and believes that he will. Now again on top of that again some of things, some of the learings through COVID-19, some of the way we think about how we'll move forward and some of the -- pudding those learings to work the way we work differently remote working even the I think we can maintain some of our safety performance and some of our productivity performance as Jon said, the teams is committed to do that. Now to layer in rights, the teams has been hard at work getting that put into the business and we've got a great percentage of it implement and that's just the first phase and then this is going to be the gift that keeps on giving right. Once we get sort of digitized there and we get the initial benefits then it's going to be one chapter after another of new opportunity that, that will present to us right and so look there are a lot of great supplement horizon. You can't take all that obviously into the remainder of 2020, but as we get further along as we always do, and I told with the preliminary outlook and that we'll share some of those details with you in as the world starts to settle down too right. Then we'll start sharing some of that in February next year. But we think the outlook is very bright and 30% margin is very much in our minds and very reasonable goal in our perception.\nMichael Feniger: And just lastly, over the years your volumes were a little lighter than your peers and you guys were shutting business, there were talks about non-regrettable losses. Is your book of business now higher quality than it was a few years ago to help get through a time like that. You guys haven\u2019t talked about those non-regrettable losses in a while, but I'm just curious if you could help us with the context you guys going through that process and where that leaves you now in this tough backdrop. Thanks Don.\nDon Slager: Yeah we spend a lot of time understanding the customer. Not all customers are equal and they are all going to have the same need. So we specifically put a lot of time and energy targeting customers that are willing to pay and willing to stay. Loyalty is a big part of our strategy and where we invest our time and energy and to your point, we had some optimization across the portfolio and a little bit of that will happen all the time as we acquire some more top gains bits and pieces of that business but we feel very, very good about our portfolio. In terms of customers who are willing to pay at all levels from initial subscription all the way up to national accounts and everybody has got to pay their fair share. We feel really good about the progress we've made.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Henry Chien with BMO. Please go ahead.\nHenry Chien: Have, good afternoon thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to dig in a little bad and ask you about the pricing dynamic it's been very strong and yeah I was a bit curious if you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that and how much of that is structural supply shortage, if you will willing in disposal capacity and how much of it is like what you're saying before and just proving more value to your customers and what that is that's keeping that price at a pretty solid rate?\nDon Slager: For sure let's start with this notion of being an essential service right. We really are an essential service and with all the work we've done as John just mentioned to understand customers what they want, what they value, what do they want to pay for, that reliability is top of mind right and just like when you go to turn the faucet you expect the water to come out and you go to flip the light switch, you expect the lights to come on, when you roll the cart to the street, you expect it to be gone that same day within the same window of time. The work we've been doing operationally with one fleet -- fleet helpfully reliability is paying dividends today. The work we've done around a workforce planning and our employee engagement and route readiness, all those things right are coming to bear today. Employee engagement now it makes us safer but it makes our entire organization think about how we better serve the customer right. And so we got about NPS going up towards the nine points or very much wired around that. So when we think we have a service that is valued by our customers, when we show up the way we do with that relentless attitude to get the job done and then we do that even in a difficult time, we feel like we can continue to price through that event and we did that and our customers rewarded us for our hard work. If you back all the way up to the macro right, you have a rational environment out there, when you think about the cost of disposal, the limited amount of ample space even though we have a lot of years ahead of us, it's more and more difficult to get that space permitted and so on. All those things continue to play into just a strong environment and I am really encouraged when we think about and we talk about this for the call, the strength of American business and the business mentality of people all the way back, the strengthen of the free market, not to get too patriotic, but the American spirit right. When we see our own people showing up every day that's happening in other companies as well, that happening in other businesses, that happening with our customers and people have a much more positive outlook I think in the world than what you read in the headlines right. And we're seeing right here in our numbers. We're seeing it right here in the consumption, in the waste generation rates, our story tells a different story than what you might read if you just read the newspaper. So look that strength on the business model and our pricing tools and the way our field leaders work with our pricing meters here and that what we do is really important and has value and what I am telling you like the digital tools will further enhance that relationship. We're going to connect cabs to customers. We're going to further improve the quality of the product and that's going to give us continued pricing power as we move ahead.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Don, you mentioned a couple of times the digital investment in RISE, you started to roll that out last year and at least just the initial folks is really about really about improving effect efficacy and real-time routing information and data visualization. You mentioned that you had implemented a fair amount of that in pandemic, then the pandemic hit and first I would imagine the new variables into the mix to your operations and test that pipeline. So how does it perform? What impact did it make or benefit that you see. How does that experience and form your current your digitalization plans going forward.\nDon Slager: Yeah it performed well just through from a plumbing standpoint, right. The IT team did an incredible job that everything right we move people around and included the right platform right operating without a hitch. So the technical side of it operated very well and the performance side operated well to capacity. One those that had it implemented already, used it to really reconfigure the operations, right? As weight got heavy on residential and there was more demand there, and then things got contained or constricted in small container, large container, we were able to optimize routes in a great way and then the deployment itself back to your cost of what goes away. Our deployment was a typically hand to hand combat model where we would go out and spend a couple of weeks, working shoulder to shoulder. COVID didn\u2019t allow us to do that. So we've deployed those things entirely remotely. We did stop the pace. We kept going and the performance in a remote deployment has been on par, the deployment and the in person deployment. So as we think about continue to put tablets in the cab and all the further ways of digital operations, our ability to do that both from a cost and a steep standpoint improves and that's a great learning coming out go.\nJon Vander Ark: Look when you think about that from a change management perspective, we've gone from sort of push to pull right, the things that we're producing here are value added in the minds of our frontline leaders and they're anxious to get those tools in their hands. So they're very willing and able to implement that but they're pulling that capability and so I am hopeful that our speed to change, the more and more we do these things, our speed of change can actually increase as well.\nNoah Kaye: That's great color and maybe just one more and you mentioned that a couple times here, the progress on moving the CPI book of business to an alternative pricing mechanism, now if I go back three years, you basically do you want to double your revenue exposure to an alternative index, but just given that you're highlighting that as one of the keys to continue move the margin profile up, can you share with us any targets a benchmark that you're really hoping to get to say over the next couple of years, how you want investors judge that progress and frankly how does what's happening now the current environment impact that?\nJon Vander Ark: We haven\u2019t actually shared the absolute goal and look I would just ask you to look at the progress we've made as a testament to the ability to do it. There are a lot of factors, when contracts come due, the size of contracts and just the pace of change, the dynamic of the market, all those things are variables to get to work through but I'll tell you that again we're committed, we see the market moving and we're going to stand here every quarter and tell you about the progress we're making and you can hold us for that.\nDon Slager: Yeah I think the progress we've made during this pandemic is a good indication of our result and commitment. Because our municipal sales team is pretty busy at City hall because we still have some customers from a recycling standpoint that we need to get into a different risk in relationship with, still some work to do on alternative index, obviously. And as more people work from home and we're are going to envision probably being a little heavier those initial contracts completed, we're going to have a dialogue about getting pace of the work we do and that's going to be a very important piece. Again fairness is on our side. All we're trying to do is get paid for the work we do and we've got a pretty good track record when that's the argument our customers working with us. That's great and again that's upside.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nDon Slager: Thank you, Grant. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and we're well positioned as volume continues to recover. Despite volume declines, we grew earnings, delivered double-digit free cash flow, expanded adjusted EBITDA margins. We also reinstated full year adjusted free cash flow guidance, which includes the low-end of our original 2020 guidance range and then we mentioned that we raised our dividend for 16 years straight. That's a lovely stat.\\ Once again, I'd like to thank all Republic employees for their ongoing hard work, commitment and indication to our customers and communities each of our employees truly embodies the committed to serve spirit. Have a good evening and stay safe.",

            "name": "Don Slager",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased with our second quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the resiliency of our business, the power of our operating model and the strength of our cash flow. We delivered strong results in the second quarter by leveraging the solid foundation we built over the last decade. During the quarter we increased adjusted earnings per share, delivered double-digit growth and adjusted free cash flow and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points to 29.6%. I'm proud of the results the team delivered and truly inspired by their dedication to the Republic way. Our leaders are working tirelessly to keep our people safe, adjust our operations to changing demand and ensure consistent, reliable service to our customers. Our front-line employees continue to show every day for customers and each other and our support personnel quickly adjusted to new way of working. It was the collective effort of all 36,000 employees that delivered these results. Our economic outlook is positive. Since April, total volume has increased month-over-month through July. In our small container business, we are seeing a similar volume trend. Additionally, container weights increased sequentially through July indicating steady improvement in consumption and economic activity. As always, we are running our business for the long-term and continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience, improve the efficiency of our operations and strengthen our market position. These investments will position us well for future growth. In the second quarter, we continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to shareholders. Year-to-today we've invested $124 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and grow free cash flow. Our deal pipeline continues to be strong and we remain on track to invest $600 million to $650 million in acquisitions this year. In July, our board approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend. The consistent growth in the dividend demonstrates the stability and predictability of our cash flows as well as our confidence in delivering future cash flow growth and year-to-today we've returned $99 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and have approximately $600 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We now have greater clarity on how the pandemic impacts our business and how we can continue to adjust operations and effectively manage spending. As a result, we are reinstating our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.175 billion. Our ability to achieve the low-end of our original free cash flow guidance, demonstrates the tenacity of our team, the flexibility of our operating model and the strength and stability of our free cash flow. As an essential service provider, we play a critical role in our communities. This starts by providing uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances and being a responsible and ethical partner in the community. This quarter we were recognized for our efforts and were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the first time. For this list, 1,000 of the largest US public companies were evaluated and ranked based on transparency and performance across 141 environmental, social and governance factors. Lastly, we recently published our 2019 sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making on our most significant opportunities to positively impact our customers, employees, communities, shareholders and the environment. I would encourage you to give it a look, it's a great read. Now call over to Jon. As we said right, we have a positive outlook on the trend right and we feel good about a couple of things. One, residential weight increases have stabilized right and now small container weights are resuming right. So again strength of American business, consumption rates, the consumer we think is getting stronger, people are adjusting to a new way of doing things, you see that all around you right. So we've a very positive outlook. Exactly when it will go positive, we can't put our finger on that and so the guidance we give is around cash flow which we think is strong. We chose in April, we thought we know saw a scenario we can catch by the end of range and now we're telling you we're even more confident than that and all the trends are positive and Jon gave you a lot of great trends on cost management and CapEx and people paying their bills the whole nine yards so to speak. So when it goes positive we'll have more full year in the next quarter and hopefully that will be another good news story we can share with everybody. Right like Jon mentioned, safety is a bright spot, employee engagement is at all-time high. We expect that to continue. We're still doing great work to take care of our front-line people. But look the acquisition pipeline being full we're talking about tuck-ins obviously we're tucking in into current markets that's a margin enhancement in and of its own. We talk about running business for the long term and sort of the depths of COVID, we were busy adapting to new wave of doing business, but we're back at long-term planning in the business. Jon and his team are still rolling out the RISE platform across the organization, the digital tools. We're well underway there. So we're back at it and all of those things are going to be margin enhancers as we go forward. So there's a lot of good news we'll be talking about here as we get ahead this next couple of quarters off. Yeah, there is one big deal out there right that we've talked about but there are some others. Again I continue to say look there are a number of really nice companies out there well run and good markets, good people getting to a place in their life cycle where talking those makes sense. We're engaged in some other good conversations. So we've a lot of confidence in the pipeline, but there is one big deal out there that will carry forward for that. Look, they're paying us a fair price, and they're paying us on time. And I think to Jon's point, I think they value the service, and rewarding us for the hard work and the effort our frontline people are putting out so. Well, I think, even Jon just said, with the pipeline, not only strong for the remainder of the year, the $600 million to $650 million range, we've given what we think is strong into next year. So do I have an outlook for the next 10 years, I don't, but I would tell you just based on where we are, in this point of history again, there's a lot of great companies out there. We know where they are, who they are, we have ongoing conversations, we think that a sort of a robust pipeline of deals and a continued appetite for good deals, good companies is going to be somewhat of a regular diet for us, at least into the future here, we can see and certainly, we have the appetite, we have the ability and the team continues to demonstrate their ability to very efficiently integrate these things. And after we get everything up to start a company standard really turn into cash flow on that, we think that generate. And as we look back at the deals we've done, we've got a high degree of confidence in what they've delivered. So we know that, we're paying the right price for deals and making the right assumptions on the way in. So it gives us all more competence to keep ongoing. Thank you, Brian. So look, our strategy around market position hasn't changed, right. We strive to be number one or number two in the markets we serve, we strive to be vertically integrated. And again, the results you see there are result of decades of building around that pillar of our strategy. We want to get in front of the growth, right. We want to be where people are. And so when you think about the Sunbelt that we talked about from Portland, Seattle, Washington, down the coast across Texas, up into the Carolinas, and all the little pockets that people are moving into hotspots like Nashville, right, we're there. We've got a great business mix, a great business portfolio of urban centers which sort of picks-up some of the growth around sort of the urbanization trend. We've got a great business position in secondary markets, right. And so look, you won't see especially winder in the markets. We're not in and do startups, just because they're hotspots for people. But if we can take a number one or number two position in an adjacent market that we're not in currently but next door or brand new market, we'll do that. And we've done that, we've done that over the last couple of years, you've seen us go into some, some new secondary markets because we were able to take a nice position. So again, we've got a great pipeline, we've got a great M&A team, a great leader in that group. And again, we've got the balance sheet to continue to grow that way. Great thing about our business, again as population grows, as business formation grows around that, we're very well situated with our portfolio and the fact that we're East and West and North and South kind of insulates us when they're sort of micro pockets of bad news, right. So while there may be a couple of cities right now where the epidemic still on the upswing where plenty of cities where the numbers are going the other way, and so we're getting that balanced benefit. So again, that's the strength of the portfolio, the power of the portfolio. And so one thing that will change in our outlook is just as Jon said, I mean, we've learned a lot on how we can work a little differently. And we're taking all those lessons to heart, that will make us better. It'll make us even more attractive company to work for. It'll make our employees even more engaged. It'll make us leaner. But it won't change our outlook on how we grow. And again, I think we're very well situated for all of that. Thank you. Not a strong one given the uncertainty, only that construction has held up pretty well, right if you think about right? If you had you at C&D tons into our landfill or we printed a pretty strong quarter there. And I think in many markets construction has been the bright spot and everything else was shut down and people are sheltering in place. In most markets construction had an exemption. And really strong obviously on the residential side, right construction, probably a lot of current projects getting finished, but we're still seeing new activity in market, so probably too early to tell in terms of the longer-term outlook. Hi, Michael. Yeah Michael, let me give you a couple of numbers here right. So I talked about in my prepared remarks that we expect the working capital benefit to flip in the second half of the year and quite honestly that's just because we saw really strong DSO and DPO performance in the second half of 2019. So it's not expect that we expect those to step down in the current year. It's just going to anniversary. So we no longer enjoy that working capital benefit in the second half. The real big deal is the cash taxes. So when you take a look at what we expect to spend in cash taxes in the second half, it's over $100 million more than what we spent in the first half. The other thing I'll just point out is just because we had some refunds in the prior year, we would expect cash taxes to at least $100 million more on a full-year basis than in 2019 and just to your final point, cash tax as a percent of provision was about 12% last year, this year we're expecting to be about 70%. 70%. Hey Michael did we mentioned that we reinstated our original free cash flow guidance? Well look, nothing is ever out of reach. How's that? Yeah that's fair and again I think the big impact theirs is just going to be cash taxes with what you're seeing at that 50-plus conversion that we're seeing in the first half versus what a more normalized rate would be. Yeah I don't know your question unless you're just emphatically agreeing with me but... Look back through all the years you've known us, we have a really good track record of telling what we're going to do and then doing what we say and we wouldn't tell you what we're telling you if we didn't have a pretty good handle on it right. So we're very committed to growing through acquisitions but I can't say enough about the team that we have in place. The person leads that team, the amount of time that we spent talking about it and the amount of great companies that we see out there. So we're in that game and we're going to continue to make intelligent investments in growing our business, expanding our business that way and that's going to be, we'll be right in the hunt along with anyone else and hopefully because of relationships because of our style, because of our ability to get things done we'll get more than our fair share. Sure let me start by stating that the 30% margin goal is still very much in our minds and very, very real. There are two main things that have sort of in our nemesis there. One was the CPI escalator built into all of our contracts for decades that we've been overcoming and John mentioned in his remarks the great progress that the team has made in moving away from that archaic element of our contract into something that is more relevant and the teams are doing a great job there. And so that's just another way of showing that once remind something we move the needle, we move the market. We did that with the recovery fee, we're doing it now with alternative index and then the other thing that's our nemesis is recycling right and again we have really put a stake in the ground here. We talk about recycling measure we're second 2.0, the team has made an incredible improvement in progress in moving off all the old way of pricing and sharing in the risk and getting that risk appropriately balanced and that's more to come. So not only are we getting it done with our customers, because our customers value what we do and are willing to pay and understand the fairness of it, but the market is moving right. We're seeing that become more and more of a norm because it's just common sense to do it that way and so again and as that -- as those two things continue to shift as we close the gaps on that alternative index and on the recycling sharing arrangement, those by themselves go a long way toward getting us to 30%. Now just those two things and again if you look at the progress just trend them out in and the team is fighting hard and Jon is committed his eye and to get that done and believes that he will. Now again on top of that again some of things, some of the learings through COVID-19, some of the way we think about how we'll move forward and some of the -- pudding those learings to work the way we work differently remote working even the I think we can maintain some of our safety performance and some of our productivity performance as Jon said, the teams is committed to do that. Now to layer in rights, the teams has been hard at work getting that put into the business and we've got a great percentage of it implement and that's just the first phase and then this is going to be the gift that keeps on giving right. Once we get sort of digitized there and we get the initial benefits then it's going to be one chapter after another of new opportunity that, that will present to us right and so look there are a lot of great supplement horizon. You can't take all that obviously into the remainder of 2020, but as we get further along as we always do, and I told with the preliminary outlook and that we'll share some of those details with you in as the world starts to settle down too right. Then we'll start sharing some of that in February next year. But we think the outlook is very bright and 30% margin is very much in our minds and very reasonable goal in our perception. Yeah we spend a lot of time understanding the customer. Not all customers are equal and they are all going to have the same need. So we specifically put a lot of time and energy targeting customers that are willing to pay and willing to stay. Loyalty is a big part of our strategy and where we invest our time and energy and to your point, we had some optimization across the portfolio and a little bit of that will happen all the time as we acquire some more top gains bits and pieces of that business but we feel very, very good about our portfolio. In terms of customers who are willing to pay at all levels from initial subscription all the way up to national accounts and everybody has got to pay their fair share. We feel really good about the progress we've made. For sure let's start with this notion of being an essential service right. We really are an essential service and with all the work we've done as John just mentioned to understand customers what they want, what they value, what do they want to pay for, that reliability is top of mind right and just like when you go to turn the faucet you expect the water to come out and you go to flip the light switch, you expect the lights to come on, when you roll the cart to the street, you expect it to be gone that same day within the same window of time. The work we've been doing operationally with one fleet -- fleet helpfully reliability is paying dividends today. The work we've done around a workforce planning and our employee engagement and route readiness, all those things right are coming to bear today. Employee engagement now it makes us safer but it makes our entire organization think about how we better serve the customer right. And so we got about NPS going up towards the nine points or very much wired around that. So when we think we have a service that is valued by our customers, when we show up the way we do with that relentless attitude to get the job done and then we do that even in a difficult time, we feel like we can continue to price through that event and we did that and our customers rewarded us for our hard work. If you back all the way up to the macro right, you have a rational environment out there, when you think about the cost of disposal, the limited amount of ample space even though we have a lot of years ahead of us, it's more and more difficult to get that space permitted and so on. All those things continue to play into just a strong environment and I am really encouraged when we think about and we talk about this for the call, the strength of American business and the business mentality of people all the way back, the strengthen of the free market, not to get too patriotic, but the American spirit right. When we see our own people showing up every day that's happening in other companies as well, that happening in other businesses, that happening with our customers and people have a much more positive outlook I think in the world than what you read in the headlines right. And we're seeing right here in our numbers. We're seeing it right here in the consumption, in the waste generation rates, our story tells a different story than what you might read if you just read the newspaper. So look that strength on the business model and our pricing tools and the way our field leaders work with our pricing meters here and that what we do is really important and has value and what I am telling you like the digital tools will further enhance that relationship. We're going to connect cabs to customers. We're going to further improve the quality of the product and that's going to give us continued pricing power as we move ahead. Yeah it performed well just through from a plumbing standpoint, right. The IT team did an incredible job that everything right we move people around and included the right platform right operating without a hitch. So the technical side of it operated very well and the performance side operated well to capacity. One those that had it implemented already, used it to really reconfigure the operations, right? As weight got heavy on residential and there was more demand there, and then things got contained or constricted in small container, large container, we were able to optimize routes in a great way and then the deployment itself back to your cost of what goes away. Our deployment was a typically hand to hand combat model where we would go out and spend a couple of weeks, working shoulder to shoulder. COVID didn't allow us to do that. So we've deployed those things entirely remotely. We did stop the pace. We kept going and the performance in a remote deployment has been on par, the deployment and the in person deployment. So as we think about continue to put tablets in the cab and all the further ways of digital operations, our ability to do that both from a cost and a steep standpoint improves and that's a great learning coming out go. Yeah I think the progress we've made during this pandemic is a good indication of our result and commitment. Because our municipal sales team is pretty busy at City hall because we still have some customers from a recycling standpoint that we need to get into a different risk in relationship with, still some work to do on alternative index, obviously. And as more people work from home and we're are going to envision probably being a little heavier those initial contracts completed, we're going to have a dialogue about getting pace of the work we do and that's going to be a very important piece. Again fairness is on our side. All we're trying to do is get paid for the work we do and we've got a pretty good track record when that's the argument our customers working with us. That's great and again that's upside. Thank you, Grant. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and we're well positioned as volume continues to recover. Despite volume declines, we grew earnings, delivered double-digit free cash flow, expanded adjusted EBITDA margins. We also reinstated full year adjusted free cash flow guidance, which includes the low-end of our original 2020 guidance range and then we mentioned that we raised our dividend for 16 years straight. That's a lovely stat.\\ Once again, I'd like to thank all Republic employees for their ongoing hard work, commitment and indication to our customers and communities each of our employees truly embodies the committed to serve spirit. Have a good evening and stay safe."

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks Don. In the second quarter, we remain focused on our priorities putting our people first, keeping our facilities running smoothly and taking care of our customers. By staying focused on these priorities, we successfully executed our plan and delivered strong financial and operational results. These results clearly demonstrate we're well-positioned to come out of this pandemic stronger and better than before. As expected, revenue decreased in the quarter due to customer's temporarily suspending or reducing service levels. Volume decreased 7.4% versus the prior year. The volume decline was steepest in April and sequentially improved throughout the quarter. In April, total volume decreased 10.2%. In Just, volume improved to a 5.4% decline versus the prior year. The decline in volume and pace of recovery varies by line of business and by market. Landfill special waste volume was impacted the most, decreasing 17% versus the prior year. Special waste volumes were down 22% in April and in June were down 13%. The decrease in special waste volume was primarily due to jobs being deferred, not canceled and the pipeline remained strong. In the second quarter, landfill MSW volume decreased 3.5% and landfill C&D volume was essentially flat. Second quarter small container volume decreased by 8.8%. In April, small container volume was down 10.5%. By June volume sequentially improved 300 basis points and was down 7.5% versus the prior year. Second quarter large container volume decreased 12.4%. In April, large container volume was down 17.3% and by June volume was down 7.2% versus the prior year. We expect volume to continue to recover over the remainder of the year. During the quarter we weigh contractual terms to support our customers in their time of need. We made pausing and resuming service simple and easy. We waived late fees and offered flexible payment plans to our most loyal customers in need of assistance. Our results demonstrate that customers appreciate our efforts and value our service. Our net promoter score increased nine point from the prior year and we maintained our customer churn of 7%. Additionally, we successfully executed our pricing program to cover our cost and inflation. This enabled us to continue to deliver the essential services we provide while being mindful of the challenges our customers faced. Total core price was 4.7%. This included open market pricing of 5.5% and restricted pricing of 3.4%. Core price represents price increases to our same-store customers net of rollbacks. Average yield was 2.5%. Average yields measures the changes -- the change in average price per unit and taken into account the impact of customer churn. Thanks for the team's relentless efforts, we effectively managed our cost and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin a 170 basis point versus the prior year. Due to our investments in innovative routing and workforce planning tools, we were able to quickly adjust our routes for changes in demand. This enabled us to reduce over time by 25% versus the prior year and increase productivity across our entire collection business. For example, in our large container line of business, productivity improved approximately 230 basis points. Throughout the quarter our drivers remain engaged and focused. Attendance remained at all-time high and turnover was at multiyear lows. We all decreased safety-related expenses by 19% or 13 basis point of revenue -- 30 basis points of revenue compared to the prior year. We achieved the best safety performance in the company's history, reducing safety incidences by approximately 20% versus the prior year. During the quarter, we continue to partner with our municipal customers and discuss the impact of COVID on our business. In the second quarter, residential weights were up 10.1% versus the prior year. Weights tapered down during the quarter and by June, residential weights were up 7.6% versus the prior year. We also continue to renegotiate contracts with favorable pricing terms. We now have $850 million of annual revenue or 34% of our CPI based book of business tied to a waste index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. Next, turning to environmental services, during the quarter, environmental services revenue decreased 26% from the prior year. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and a delay of in-plant project work. The decrease in environmental services revenue resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. We expect this headwind to continue in the second half of the year. Turning to recycling, during the second quarter, recycled commodity prices increased 29% to $101 per ton compared to $78 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher cycle commodity prices was partially offset by 11% decrease in inbound recycling volume. Finally, preliminary results for July indicate total revenue increased approximately 1.5% from June. We typically see July revenue increase from June due to seasonality. Total revenue in July was down approximately 3% from the prior year. For reference purposes, total revenue in June was down 3.5% from the prior year. With that, I will now to the call over to Brian. Let me give you a couple of thoughts there. So there were certainly some macroeconomic benefits that we realized. In the second quarter we kind of talked about that. So for example some of the things we saw around container weight, we would expect those to -- those benefits I would say to moderate as we look forward, but I'd say that being said, we do expect to be more profitable as we look for, we've learned things about ourselves on how we can operate differently, one within cost of operations as well as within SG&A and we would expect those benefits to accrue to the P&L in future periods. It's very geographic to your point Tyler. We've looked at a lot of productivity data and circumstance to understand, we love traffic obviously, we're more efficient in getting the recycling in the garbage off the ground and surprisingly we're seeing pretty steady trend across both rural and urban markets and you think you get a much bigger advantage in urban markets and we're seeing kind of the same advantage across all of those markets which to Brian's earlier point gives us some confidence that some of the cost that we've captured on the way down, we're going to keep that on the way back in those productivity improvements and I wouldn't -- again we haven't -- we're not releasing this data, but I haven't seen dramatic differences between urban, suburban and rural right in terms of the activity levels in volume. I think one of the bright spots for this is when we explode down pricing deals right in the decline here I understand what demand was going to happen. We never stopped conversation and our acquisition pipeline remains very robust, very active and we now are starting to write deals with sellers as we've got a lot more confident in our outlook and there's and feel really confident going forward for the rest of this year and next year in terms of that one. Yes, I would sit there and say it's what you just mentioned quite honestly. So from where fuel prices are right now, we think sequentially that steps down about 40 basis points. So starting with our 29.6 in the second quarter, there would be a sequential decline of 40 basis points. And then commodity prices would be another 20, right. So you're already down 60 basis points just with those two, and I talked about the container weight, right. And we saw those lighter by 20% in April, and actually by July, that's down to about 6%. So that benefit that we enjoyed in the second quarter, we don't expect that to repeat at the same level, going forward. But quite honestly, while it's a near-term cost headwind, it's actually a good sign, right. It's a really good sign for the health of our small business customer. Yes, so that's something we have to overcome. Yes, which is just a timing thing. Look as I said, we've got $600 million remaining on the authorization, we continue to look at the intrinsic value of the business. Again, we look at that based on our three-year outlook and our three-year plan, right. So we're looking at real actionable plan against what, how we think the stock will perform. You look at our track record, we've always taken a balanced approach with that intrinsic mindset. At the same time, we've said look we will flex buyback based on opportunity in the market as it relates to M&A and maintain the optimal leverage ratio of call it right around three times and so all those things are in play. We've got a lot of flexibility. We got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. So we're in a good place. And if the market allows it and we see an opportunity, we'll buy opportunistically just as we have. And frankly, I think we'd beat the market year-in and year-out. So the balanced approach won't change. But we'll continue to look to put our money to work and return to shareholder is the best way that we can, we think we do it as efficiently as anybody. Yes, it's gradual. Again, there's some timing things year-over-year. So some of our fees are impacted by fuel declines. There's a year-over-year decline on that, but our core pricing philosophy is not changing. We want to send a fair price with the hard work that we do, and customers reward and value that and pay us. Thanks Brian. No, we're not giving that level of detail on July. But steady recovery across that, and I would say that we have a little bit of a geographic headwind that we've had to overcome as the COVID cases initially started out in the Northeast and we're heavily impacted, or we have a lighter footprint, the heavier caseload in the last couple of months has been in the South and Southwest. So Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arizona, California, we have significant market positions in all of those markets. And yet we're still seeing volumes recover. So that gives us a lot of optimism. But the outlook is positive. There's still uncertainty of course, there's going to be puts and takes across different geographies. And week-to-week, we're running the business for the long-term, but we feel like we certainly far more than exceeded the floor, and we're on our way to a nice day recovery. And the only thing I will add about, our CapEx plan is naturally pulls back when we don't have the volume, 10% of our annual CapEx typically is for volume growth. And we're not seeing that growth, we're naturally not going to spend that CapEx, what we see decline in some of our replacement schedules for trucks naturally push out, we're still investing in the business. We're still working on projects, still investing in our digital operations platform which is rise and run the business for the long-term. So the team's done a great job in the face of a pandemic, not just working the quarter but working for our multi-year plan. And Kyle as I mentioned, the midpoint of right around $1.1 billion, the range is $1.075 billion to $1.15 billion. Hi, Michael. Look when you think about that from a change management perspective, we've gone from sort of push to pull right, the things that we're producing here are value added in the minds of our frontline leaders and they're anxious to get those tools in their hands. So they're very willing and able to implement that but they're pulling that capability and so I am hopeful that our speed to change, the more and more we do these things, our speed of change can actually increase as well. We haven't actually shared the absolute goal and look I would just ask you to look at the progress we've made as a testament to the ability to do it. There are a lot of factors, when contracts come due, the size of contracts and just the pace of change, the dynamic of the market, all those things are variables to get to work through but I'll tell you that again we're committed, we see the market moving and we're going to stand here every quarter and tell you about the progress we're making and you can hold us for that."

            "content": "Thanks Jon. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $743 million an increase of approximately 20% over the prior year. Free cash flow growth was driven by an improvement in working capital, which was partially offset by a $51 million increase in capital expenditures when compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditures demonstrates our commitment to invest throughout the pandemic, which will protect and improve the long-term health of our business. The contribution from working capital includes a one-day improvement in DSL, a two-day improvement in DPO and a $35 million payroll tax deferral under the Cares Act. We expect a total payroll tax deferral of approximately $100 million in 2020, which will flip over the next two years. To date cash collections have remained strong. We believe our DSO performance reflects our customer's willingness to pay with a high quality service we provide and the essential nature of our business. We expect the working capital benefit from DSO and DPO to anniversary in the second half of the year since we saw improvement in these metrics in the latter part of 2019. With respect to EBITDA margin, the 170 basis points of expansion over the prior year included 110 basis points of improvement from favorable net fuel and higher recycled commodity price and 60 basis points of improvement in the underlying business. The business absorbed $31 million of COVID-related costs during the quarter. These costs related to the investment made in our commitment-to-serve initiative to recognize our front-line employees and support our small business customers, additional PPE and enhanced facility cleaning to help keep our people safe and supplemental paid time off and enhanced medical benefits for employees and their families. EBITDA margin expansion resulted from reducing operating and SG&A cost by a combined $151 million or 8%. This completely offset the $151 million or 5.8% decline in revenue. Most of the cost reductions resulted from effective cost management that positively impacted nearly all P&L line items. Our focus on cost control will enable us to gain leverage on volume growth as demand returns. Some of the cost improvement resulted from macroeconomic factors that positively impacted results. For example, transfer and disposal costs were down 80 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower container weights in our small container business. Container weights were at their lowest level in April and progressively got heavier throughout the quarter. While we are not providing specific EBITDA margin guidance, we expect second half margin to be at or slightly above the second half of last year. This would result in full year margin expansion. During the quarter, total debt decreased to $8.7 billion and total liquidity increased to $2.3 billion. Interest expense in the second quarter was $92 million and included $16 million of non-cash amortization. Our leverage ratio was approximately three times.. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.1% and in line with our expectations. Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reinstating full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion $1.175 billion. This guidance assumes continued gradual improvement in economic activity through the remainder of the year. And with that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Yeah so Tyler of the original $100 million that we were spending it's probably going to be $60 million. So $40 million of that will roll into 2021. Yeah I'll give you three Hamzah, real estate is certainly one of them and we're reevaluating what roles should always be in the office, what roles can be permanently at home and what roles will have some flexibility to them and therefore we capture real estate savings on the ones that home or the ones that are flexible. I think travel is another one, the tools that we use to work remotely, we have spent far more connected and efficient than we expected. There will be roles, there is a role for travel going forward. So operating completely virtual is not a norm that we'll have but we'll certainly be spending less on T&E as we go forward, as we kind of think about that's both worlds. And then just in terms of labor productivity, I think our ability to flex labor and move people cross-train, move people across different lines of business has allowed us to serve customers really well as well as manage cost the same time and we'll certainly carry some of those forward as we recover from the pandemic. Yeah. So we look at a range of options. Obviously, they're given with an unprecedented event and definitely want to be empathetic to customers who were their businesses were changing dramatically. So as I talked about, we let people break contracts to suspend service. And were in constant communication with them about when they could come back at a time that was right for them. We were flexible on payment terms with some of our customers and certainly offered that too many more, that didn't take us up on it, and then spent a lot of time and energy on committed reserve. So we put money in the hands of our frontline people to serve our customers. So our philosophy was that customers while they maybe need a little cost relief, what they really needed is customers and revenue, when we got our local teams engaged and energized to power our small business customers through a very difficult time and got a lot of positive feedback from our customers on that front and listen, we are out there every day in a tough environment, picking up the recycling and the garbage and doing a hard job and our customers are noticing it, and they're paying us a fair price for the hard work that we're doing. So I think that's the primary reason we've been able to sustain it. And going forward, I think we see more of the same obviously, there's some puts and takes in terms of year-over-year and some fees that might change year-over-year, but the philosophy is not changing. And we expect a strong pricing performance in the second half. I think in Jon's prepared remarks, he mentioned seasonality, right. So we actually are seeing some seasonality in the business. And so with all that Jon just mentioned overcoming what's happening out there again, that leads us to our positive outlook. Yes, we actually in our guidance, we provided the various components including, what we expect from a cash from operations as well as our CapEx. So you can actually see the various components in our 8-K filing. If you kind of take the midpoint of the range though, what we're kind of thinking, it's approximately $1.1 billion of CapEx. Again it just reiterates the flexibility we have in the business model, when these things happen, we've got the ability to flex very quickly and still produce the cash flow and meet our obligations. So again, I think it's the great outcome of a lot of great work from the team. But again, it just really shines right light and conversely, the business model is. Well, look, I mean I think the traditional role of the CFO, when you just think about making sure that we have good quality financials, I mean going to be spending obviously my time on that, but even more so when you think about me keeping right the IT department and when we think about our investments in technology, how they're enabling things like our platform, how they're doing things, quite honestly, even on the SG&A and when we think about modernizing our core systems, that's where I'm going to be spending the majority of my time, just to make sure that we set ourselves up well for future growth and enhance profitability. Okay, thanks. Yes, one thing I would add to that is I'm hearing a lot of people talk about, how they'll use space differently, not necessarily having less space, but having more open space and having more space between cubicles and I know for us for a long time, we need more office space, so we went from the 10 by 8 cubicle to the 8 by 8 cubicle to the 6 by 6 cubicle and just to sort of squeeze people in. So I've heard that from a number of companies that they're going to use this opportunity to maybe maintain some of the space they have and just make it more wide open, more, more sunlight for their people, more meeting space that's required that kind of thing and just to appeal to the next generation of workforce, so I think that's going to be true for a lot of people. That's a pretty typical of what we say."

When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.\nDon Slager: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I hope you are doing well and staying safe and healthy. This is of course an unprecedented time for all of us. So before we get into a discussion of our results, I want to first review the steps we are taking in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.As you know, Republic Services provides an essential service. Our team is working tirelessly to serve our customers and communities. And I want to sincerely thank them for all their efforts. As always, the safety and well-being of our people is our top priority. And we are supporting them by continuing to provide all field employees with role specific PPE and masks, implementing enhanced cleaning protocols, adjusting processes, procedures and physical spaces to enable proper social distancing, rebalancing the workload to keep all people working by reducing overtime, providing supplemental paid time off and enhancing medical benefits to cover all COVID related out of pocket costs; and finally, finding new and creative ways to keep our 36,000 employees engaged, motivated and connected.Last month, we launched our $20 million Committed to Serve initiative to recognize our frontline employees, while also helping to support our small business customers and the communities we serve. We are providing weekly on site meals to employees and have sent home weekly dinners for their families. These meals are being purchased from our local small business customers. We are also providing $400 worth of gift cards to each frontline employee to help them and their families. We're encouraging them to use these cards with our small business customers. In doing so, we're not only supporting our people but also our customers by providing them with what they need most, additional revenue.Lastly, we are donating $3 million to the Republic Services Charitable Foundation. Through its National Neighborhood Promise program, the foundation is focused on rebuilding, revitalizing and restoring local communities. The $3 million will be used to fund the foundation's long-term non-profit partners who support local neighborhoods and small businesses as part of their mission.I'm not surprised by our team's ability to quickly mobilize in a time of crisis. Over the past decade, we've been investing in our business to advance our strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. Some of these investments include: developing standardized processes, implementing innovative technology, consolidating our customer service operations, and building a world class procurement organization and business continuity function.Through these investments, we\u2019ve built a solid foundation, and even more -- and even a more resilient business. These investments were the driving force behind our superior results in 2019, and our strong start to 2020. Importantly, these foundational improvements have enabled us to be more agile as we navigate the current environment. For example, through our investment in innovative routing and workforce planning tools, we've been able to quickly adjust our routes for changes in demand. And our investment in technology and collaboration tools allowed us to successfully transition approximately 6,000 of our people to work-from-home in a matter of days. And we did so without disruption to our customers, or productivity.As you can see, our company was well prepared. Furthermore, our management and business continuity teams are experienced in navigating difficult times. For example, during the great recession, we successfully adjusted our business to changes in demand and continued to generate strong cash flow. And following some of the most tragic weather events such as hurricanes Harvey and Maria, we were the first waste company back up and running in our markets. Fast forward till today, the investments in our people, processes and technology have better prepared us to manage through this unprecedented time. Next, I'd like to give you some perspective of what we are currently seeing in the business.We started the year strong in January and February. In mid March, some customers in our large container and small container businesses began adjusting their service by decreasing the frequency of pickup or temporarily pausing service. Service decreases continued in late March through mid April and have moderated since then. In the last couple of weeks, we've begun to see customers re-engage with us as they plan to reopen their businesses.Assuming these trends continue, we believe the worst is behind us and volumes will sequentially improve from here. This perspective is consistent with current GDP consensus estimates, which call for a decline in the second quarter, and sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters. With this outlook, we can expect to generate over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2020.Lastly, before turning the call over to Jon, I'd like to briefly discuss capital allocation. Despite the current pandemic, our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. We continue to believe that disciplined investment in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value.After investing in growth, we will continue to return our remaining cash flow to shareholders through dividends, and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested over $60 million in acquisitions. Our deal pipeline remains strong, and conversations with potential sellers continue to be active.With that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Don. Because we are an essential service provider, we have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of service. As a result, we were well prepared to face the challenges of pandemic. Our priorities are simple and remain unchanged: put our people first, keep our facilities running smoothly, and take care of our customers. By doing so, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term value for our stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities and shareholders.As Don discussed, we acted quickly to ensure our employees\u2019 well-being. I'm immensely proud of how well all of our employees have adjusted to these changes. For example, our drivers have remained engaged and focused during this potentially distracting time. Attendance is at an all time high, and April was our best safety month ever. Productivity and service reliability have also improved. In just three days, we transitioned 98% of our customer service representatives to work-from-home with no disruption to our service to customers.In fact, since moving to an at-home working environment, we've seen a meaningful increase in their productivity. Our first quarter results were strong, despite the headwind in March from the pandemic. We increased revenue 3.4% and expanded underlying EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. In the first quarter, average yield was 2.9% and volumes during the quarter increased 40 basis points. Excluding the benefit from an additional workday in the quarter versus the prior year, volumes decreased by 10 basis points. This included a 70 basis point increase in January and February, which was more than offset by a 1.8% decrease in March.In April, volumes decreased versus the prior year, but the magnitude and rate of change vary by line of business.Looking first at our small container business. In March, as shelter-in-place orders were implemented across the country, service decreases began to outpace service increases. Additionally, container weights started to decline. In April, total yards collected decreased by approximately 11% and container weight decreased by approximately 20%. It's important to note that in the last two weeks, trends have become more favorable. Container waste has started to increase and customers are beginning to resume service as they plan for reopening. In fact, last week, services increases fully offset services decreases.In response to these changes in demand, our local teams are leveraging existing tools and technology to adjust routes and rebalance the workload daily. Impressively, productivity in our small container business improved and over time was down approximately 45%, a true testament to the amazing work that our team is doing.Turning to our large container collection business. In April, recurring large container hauls decreased 19% versus the prior year. And temporary large container hauls decreased 14% versus the prior year. Given the decrease in demand, our teams effectively rebalanced the routes and reduced over time by approximately 50%.Next, turning to our residential collection business. In this line of business, we bill customers based on the container size and frequency of pickup rather than on the weight of the container. As a result, given we are continuing to operate as normal, the pandemic has had minimal impact on our revenue. However, as residents consume more at-home and create more recycling and solid waste, our processing and disposal costs will increase. For the month of April, average container waste increased approximately 15% versus the prior year.Regarding our disposal business. In April, third-party tons decreased by approximately 20% and included a decrease in special waste of 34%, a decrease in C&D of 11% and a decrease in MSW of only 7%. Importantly, the rate of decline has begun to moderate and last week total landfill tons were only down 15% versus the prior year.Turning to recycling. During this crisis, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the environment. Thanks to the hard work and resourcefulness of our procurement and operations teams, I\u2019m proud to report that we've been able to continue to operate our recycling processing centers across the country without any disruption. In a time like this, when e-commerce activity is increasing and the demand for fiber is increasing, it is more important than ever to keep our operations up and running safely. We've implemented social distancing and are providing necessary PPE to keep our people safe and our facilities operational. In those areas where employees are stationed less than [40 to par], we've installed plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe.Regarding our environmental services business. In April, U.S. rig counts and associated drilling activity continued to decrease sequentially from the first quarter. As a result, we expect revenues in the upstream E&P portion of our environmental services business to decrease sequentially. In the downstream portion of this business, we are also seeing headwinds, though not as severe. Downstream operators, including refineries and petrochemical companies usually benefit from lower crude prices providing a natural hedge to the volatility in the upstream portion of our business. However, given the unprecedented low demand for fuel, we expect utilization rates to come down and activity in the downstream portion of our business to decrease sequentially.Finally, turning to expense and CapEx. As we continue to operate during this uncertain time, we are adjusting our cost structure to align with real time changes in volume. Importantly, we estimate approximately 60% of our total cost structure, including cost of operations, SG&A and depreciation and amortization is variable. We are closely managing these variable costs. For example, we've put labor management strategies in place to redistribute the workload. As a result, we've reduced total overtime hours by approximately 37%. We are also reducing discretionary spending such as travel and are scaling back on capital expenditures. For example, approximately 10% of our capital budget or a little over $100 million is for growth capital, which we will no longer need to spend this year.Additionally as volumes decrease, the replacement cycle of our assets naturally extends. Therefore, we are intelligently scaling back our replacement capital to align with changes in demand including the construction of landfill airspace and the purchase of replacement trucks, containers, and equipment. Overall, we have been quickly adapting our operations based on changes in customer demand. As always, we will continue to manage the business for the long-term. We've been very nimble during this rapidly-evolving period and we'll be equally ready as the economy begins to grow again.With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our first quarter results.\nChuck Serianni: Thanks, Jon. In the first quarter, total revenue increased by 3.4%. This included average yields of 2.9% and volume growth of 40 basis points. Core price net of rollbacks was 5.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $24 million or 3.4% versus the prior year. Normalizing for an additional workday in the quarter, EBITDA increased 4.8%. Underlying EBITDA margins increased by 30 basis points.Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $267 million and decreased by $82 million versus the prior year. This decrease in free cash flow was due to the timing of capital expenditures in cash taxes. Capital expenditures in the first quarter increased $74 million and cash taxes increased $25 million versus the prior year. Normalizing for these two items, free cash flow would have increased 4.9% versus the prior year. During this unprecedented time, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will continue to have ample liquidity of $1.9 billion.Looking forward, the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy remains uncertain, in particular, the pace and timing of the recovery. As a result, we have decided to suspend our detailed financial guidance for 2020.But as Don and Jon discussed, recent trends are encouraging. The rate of volume declines is slowing and we're beginning to see customers plan for reopening. Our employees have rapidly adjusted to new ways of working to stay safe and are as engaged as ever. Our operations teams are adjusting routes daily to maintain productivity and minimize costs. We're increasing customer loyalty by continuing to provide great service to our customers and investing in our communities. And finally, we are prudently managing spending while continuing to invest for the long-term. Assuming these recent trends continue, we would still expect to generate over $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2020.In closing, we mentioned numerous times the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. But we are all facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty. One thing you can be certain of is the stability and resiliency of Republic Services. In my 20-plus year history with Republic, I've seen many ups and downs, from the great recession to the longest economic expansion in history. What I have learned is that the essential nature of our business doesn't change and what is our ability to generate strong, predictable free cash flow. Remember, the economic environment we're currently in is temporary. And when the economy returns to some level of normalcy, we will emerge stronger than ever.With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] . Your first question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: My first question here is on pricing behavior. I know you gave some indication on April tendencies on volume. But can you elaborate a little bit on how pricing behavior among some of your competitors have changed as we've gone into the second quarter during the April period?\nDon Slager: So, pricing, our pricing perspective remains consistent. We're continuing to invest in our employees and we're continuing price for the quality and committed work that we do with our customers. We have not seen any meaningful change in the market. Now, there's always pockets of behavior here and there, but that's true regardless of where we're at in the economic cycle and again our policies and approaches have remained very consistent.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, a follow up question here is on residential volume. You noted that we've seen a pickup in the in the amount of volume that -- volume increases compared to last year. Is there any sense that -- or is there any opportunity here going forward that you can reconstitute your contracts going forward to include a degree of volume pickup. How difficult is that to do? Could that be one of the changes? If you look out to your industry post COVID, if you're looking at any substantial shift in the overall industry, could that be one area where your company could focus and industry overall could focus in terms of pricing residential contracts?\nDon Slager: Certainly, it'll definitely be something we're talking about. And right now, as we've kind of come through into May, April has been all about kind of stabilizing the business, making sure that the service level, quality stays high, working with municipalities and any sort of scheduled changes that we need to accomplish. As we assess the additional tons that we have absorbed, we'll begin to talk to municipalities about what that means and look for some help. It's too early to tell yet. We'll give you more color on that once we get into reporting a second quarter.\nJon Vander Ark: The only other thing I'd add in that is we have a small number of programs that is based on the weight, they\u2019re bag programs, and the industry and we've also migrated away from those programs over the years because they're not easy for the consumer. Having one bin that they pull out to the curb, and having that automated has been safer for us, has been better for the consumer. And you've seen the industry move in that direction. And so whatever we do going forward, we want to make sure that it's still effortless for the customer.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, so Jon, appreciate all the color on April. Very helpful. But if we were to aggregate it all together, is there any way you can just be a little more specific, just basically, what did total revenue do in April just for simplicity purposes?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, well, unfortunately, Tyler we will probably cover that in July when we talk about Q2. So we can't get into overall April trends. But I would reinforce that in most of the places we think we've seen the bottom and we're starting to see recovery. So it's been a really good sign. And also I\u2019d say that bottom has been a much higher floor than I think we initially expected on that front. So we're feeling pretty positive about the outlook.\nTyler Brown: Yes, yes, agree there. So Chuck, I know there's a ton of moving pieces, but is the best way to think about it that in aggregate, the decremental margins, let's say ex the commitment to serve should be around 40%. I know it's going to vary by line, specifically, collection versus landfill. But is that probably the best way to kind of think about it?\nChuck Serianni: Yes, you're right, Tyler that 40% is accurate.\nTyler Brown: Okay. And are you guys seeing any changes in cash collection? Are you seeing an uptick in bad debts? I think you're already thinking working capital would be a drag this year. I'm just -- thoughts of maybe what's that working capital draw might look like?\nDon Slager: Yes. So we're not seeing anything as of yet. As a matter of fact the DSO went down by half a day, year-over-year, so nothing here in the first quarter. We are thinking that DSO will trickle up during the year and that's already contemplated in our cash flow guidance for the year.\nTyler Brown: Okay, and then my last one, from a quick modeling perspective, are you guys still expecting about a 1% contribution from M&A? And would that be inclusive of possibly closing Santek?\nDon Slager: Well, I think we said, we still expect to do about a 600, 650 of M&A this year, right?I think somewhere in that area, right? So you can do the math on that. It could be more. I mean we'll see how companies come through this pandemic, but the pipeline is full, our people are involved, Santek is on track. So, we will be good.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Just on that point, I think, obviously that deal is not closed yet. It's going through regulator review. We typically wouldn't comment. But other people have put that out there but we're confident we're going to close that deal in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question is around volume. You've talked about volume stabilizing, services increase offset decreases last week. When we do sort of come back in terms of commercial volume coming back, do you see any structural changes, positive or negative in terms of the shape of the recovery for the waste space, given social distancing or any other things that you think sort of, we see sort of a U-shape recovery on the volume side, any thoughts just structurally post-COVID what to expect in terms of changes around your business?\nDon Slager: Yes. Thanks, Hamzah. I think you'll see the pace of the recovery be differentiated based on geography and based on SIC code. So, you could imagine things like hospitality are going to be under pressure and that recovery is going to be a bit slower than manufacturing, which we're already seeing factories start to come back online and reopen and production ramp up. So again, we're going to see differences in that capacity as we go forward.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just a follow up question. Back in 2012, municipal residential was a weak spot and it was driven by budgetary constraints that all these municipalities had. They're probably having budgetary constraints again. Do you think that -- are you seeing that at all or I guess the Federal Government can bail them out? But, is there any sense that you're seeing in your conversations with municipalities that muni, resi pricing maybe an issue or you're not seeing that today?\nJon Vander Ark: No, Hamzah, we're not seeing that today, and obviously something we're looking into actively but don't anticipate any credit or collections issues on that side of the business. You know these are long cycle contracts. So, if there's any pressure, it would show up kind of years from now in a bid cycle. And as we've been holding line in that part of the business, making sure that we get a fair return for all the work that we do.\nDon Slager: Yes, let me add to that. That was a much different situation too, right? So that was caused by housing but caused by property values crashing, caused by property taxes dropping. The tax base of these municipalities was under pressure. To your point, Hamzah, depending on how this thing bounces back. But if it is some type of a decent U-shape recovery, we're not going to see that kind of an issue, we don't believe.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKyle White: I may have missed it, but appreciate all of the details on small container. I was just wondering if you could provide some more level of details regarding to your large container business. How are trends throughout April, was the exit rate any better, any signs of improvement both on permanent and temporary?\nDon Slager: On that we think we've absolutely found the bottom and that\u2019s stabilized and starting to see kind of trends of recovery here. You could imagine a temp for example, construction shutdown, Seattle was shutdown, reopened about 10 days ago, the Bay area was shut down in construction, and that begins to ramp up. And we're seeing a number of places that are just going gangbusters. And to Jon's point, while construction was a huge weak spot in the last recession and downturn, I think this is going to turn out to be one of the brighter spots given the housing starts already were at a modest pace and commercial construction still is pretty strong. So, we feel pretty optimistic about that part of the business.\nKyle White: Just next one is on capital return. I know you're committed to the balanced approach. But just curious are you still targeting around the 400 million in share buybacks this year. Is there any change to kind of the dividend policy, I know typically you look to increase it in July, just any thoughts there?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. No change to the dividend policy. We've been paying the dividend now for 18 years and that's not going to change. We always say that we would like to deploy our capital by purchasing EBITDA and Don mentioned that our pipeline is very robust right now, our acquisition pipeline. So looking for our capital to work by buying businesses to take advantage of what might be a pretty good opportunity right now. And then finally, returning the rest of the cash that we generate to the shareholders in the form of a share repurchase. So, our capital allocation strategy really hasn't changed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: I wanted to circle back to your commercial business. I don't know if you can parse this out for you, but even at a high level, this will be helpful. What percentage of your clients you think are just putting their service either on hold or reducing frequency, as opposed to those clients that might not come back?\nDon Slager: I think we've seen there's three things going on. There's customers who have permanently closed and we've seen very little of that, although in fairness still some shifting and sorting out as the economy starts to get some steam back in it. We're seeing customers who have temporarily suspended their service, as they have had shelter-in-place orders and they\u2019ve had eventually temporarily closed their business. And then we've seen people who have decreased their service where restaurant will be a great example who doesn't have in-room dining but does have takeout. So they may have scaled back their service. We're seeing those customers who have temporary paused their service come back online, and we're seeing now those service increases outpace service decreases in small container, which is a very positive by the way.\nJeff Silber: And then you mentioned some of the productivity improvements. You cited the reduction in overtime. Are you seeing anything else in terms of just greater route efficiency, fuel cost savings, any color on those areas would be helpful? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, certainly fuel cost savings is there as oil is at a very low historic level. I would say one of the reasons we've been successful in this environment and the productivity improved is all the hard work and the foundation that we\u2019ve built. So, we've worked really, really hard to keep our people working and employed and that meant everybody had to give up some overtime so everybody could get work and that means people picking up different routes and our different stops. And again, the customer service has improved, the productivity has improved. So real testament to our COO, Tim Stuart and the operating team for how they've done that with operations. And I'd also say this, we've benefited a bit from traffic, right, as people sheltered in place, traffic is down, especially in urban areas, our ability to get around and get to and back from the recycling side of the landfill has certainly improved.\nDon Slager: But as Jon said in his comments, right, attendance is at an all time high. Safety, that\u2019s our best safety month ever, and engagement is strong, right? And all those things will be benefits for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: If I could just go back to the earlier question on price and just be more specific. Can you talk about the take rate that you saw on price increases? And any pushback that you might have gotten on price increases, as we went through the last couple of months? Did you lose any meaningful customers due to your pricing discipline? Just curious if you can put some more detail around that.\nDon Slager: A very strong first quarter in pricing, again. Very consistent with our historic approach and making sure we get paid for the work we do. And have maintained that approach here in the last six, seven weeks, and have not seen meaningful levels of pullback on pricing. Now, our outlook anticipates some of that as people shift through their business as well. So I'm sure we'll see a little bit of that, but I don't anticipate large movements on that front.\nNoah Kaye: And then you kind of kept your expectations on M&A intact for the year, you talked about the strong activity. I'm curious if this is a obviously a different environment we're all in now versus a couple of months ago, maybe you could speak to if you\u2019ve seen any change in behavior from potential sellers, or whether that's indicative of lesser or greater opportunity for now or the more medium term, and any maybe short-term air pocket to expect just from a diligence perspective? Can you give some color there would helpful.\nDon Slager: Yes. I don't think it's a material change. Diligence, for deals we had near closing, diligence has been more difficult because we're not travelling, right? So we've had to maybe slow some of those things down and do some things remotely. That just require a little bit of innovation. But as far as new opportunity goes, I think frankly, as we've said, there are a lot of really good companies out there that we'd like to look at and talk to, some of we already have in the pipeline, there may be some more that come to market, I think for the most part companies have just been busy getting their businesses stabilized.Trying to figure this thing out. And as the market starts to come back, people will start to decide, whether they\u2019re still in this for the long-term or not. We know that we are, and we know we've got the balance sheet and the know how to get it done. So we'll be here to have conversations if there are people who want to otherwise. So we think, it'll still be a good year for us in the M&A department.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Great. And if I could ask one more, the Committed to Serve $20 million initiative. I guess first I just want to commend you for this initiative and supporting your employees first. You called out I think about $3 million in business reduction costs from COVID-19 as an adjustment, safety equipment, cleaning. Does that kind of cost fall under this program? Should we think about the sort of $3 million a month being kind of the right level of spend on those things for the near-term, just kind of expectations for an elevated cost of doing business there?\nChuck Serianni: Yes. So, the $3 million that we incurred during the first quarter were associated with just keeping our employees safe. The commitment to serve actually is a little bit different than that. That's helping the employees, but it's also helping the communities. So, how much we incurred these costs that we carved out in Q1 going forward, really depends on the duration of the pandemic, and how quickly the economy rebounds. It's a little bit too really to be able to forecast that at this point.\nDon Slager: Most of those costs were one-time in nature. So, hundreds of thousands of masks we purchased. We talked about putting some structural changes into our hauling companies to promote social distancing, screening, et cetera. So, feel really good about that. We've already always used masks on our recycling centers. So, yes, we have a little more hand sanitizer spend going forward, certainly will for a long period of time. But that's not meaningful in the overall economics.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Could I get, Chuck, what the percent of your labor costs, you all are doing a very good job of giving line item costs and OpEx. And in 2019, what percent of that labor number was overtime?\nChuck Serianni: It's about 15% Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: And when we think about how you've rolled that back, about half of that's come out. Is that what I sort of discerned through all of JVA's comments?\nChuck Serianni: Yes. A little less than that, probably closer to 40%.\nDon Slager: And keep in mind, Michael, not much came out in resi. Resi, we're working harder than ever. So, almost half in large container and small container.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Okay. That helps. And then it's terrific to hear this is a higher low than you thought it was going to be. You mentioned Jon that you were seeing less lost business, I'm trying to say this smoothly and I'm not sure I'm doing a very good job. How many customers you think don't return in the commercial business percentage wise?\nJon Vander Ark: Small, I couldn't give you a absolute number or the percentage number. I think it will be small, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: Small less than 10%.\nJon Vander Ark: It\u2019s hard to forecast exactly what the shape of the recovery is, right? If we're in an L-shape recovery, which I don't think any of us are seeing in our side of the business, yes, it could be that number. But in a kind of a steady rebound here. But I would expect less, but it's hard to say yet.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. All right. May I ask one more, if I can? You said $100 million in growth capital spending is not spent, but what is the growth capital spending -- or the total capital spending assumption if you exceed $1 billion of free cash?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. So, we'll give you more information on that, Michael as we work our way through the year here. It really depends upon the duration of the downturn, how quickly we come back, right? We talked about the growth capital. The remaining capital is really replacement, and it just depends on the utilization of our assets, which includes landfills, right? Building additional landfills airspace, and that's all predicated upon tons that we're receiving into landfill. So, much more information to come here in Q2.\nDon Slager: Yes. Look, Michael, as you know, there is a lot of moving parts, right? So, as I said already in April was all about sort of stabilizing the business, right, working with our people, keeping everybody safe. May will be about keeping everybody sort of enthusiastic and ready to return, we're already seeing all these positive signs that Jon laid out. I mean, there's positivity across all lines of business, all market verticals, there's just a lot of really great stories. If we had 4 hours earnings call we can share, we can find really great stuff, it\u2019s too soon to trend it. Right. So, that's the difficulty, there's just so many moving pieces. And the fact is that we know that we can make changes in decisions in and around CapEx and other areas of spending, which we've done and are doing and will continue to adjust. But there's still a chance right depending on how this return occurs, then we can still catch the bottom edge of our original cash flow guidance, which is over $1 billion, right.So, we're going to be making adjustments every day, every week for near the end of the year. The leadership team gets together every day at 11:00 AM and reviews every piece of data we have, and it's making decisions daily. And that'll continue under Jon's leadership. So it's been really a great process so far and it seems it\u2019s responding great. So, in July we have a lot more data and we'll have some trend information that will be more meaningful, but I would say we're focused on the cash flow and that just really underscores -- helps stability of the business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: First one from me just on labor, helpful color on the OT reductions. Just wondering if there's been any offsets there with any potential temporary increases for any employees and maybe just rounding it out with trends in retention, turnover, things like that would be helpful discussion?\nDon Slager: Sure, maybe I'll start the secondary part of your question. So, retention is at an all time high. We have some natural attrition in the business of retirements and other things, but we don't have a lot of people leaving us for bigger, better opportunities, in part because we have done extraordinary job of taking care of our people, which ties into the first part of your question. The Committed to Serve program was done for a few reasons. One, it was to honor and celebrate our frontline people, right? They perform an essential service and it's a noble purpose, and unfortunately, society doesn't do a great job of recognizing them all the time and this is their moment. This is our opportunity to elevate them and appropriately celebrate them. And then connecting that in with customers, right? Customers obviously are looking for some cost relief, what they really needed revenue and we're allowing our people and empowering our people to go support local small businesses that are our customers and when we do that we support the community. So, we think all of those things are connected and tied together.\nSean Eastman: And I'm just curious with OCC really spiking here. Does the typical sensitivity to EBITDA there hold or is there nuances on the volume or operating costs that we should be considering as we kind of flow through the recycled commodity price movement we've been seeing?\nDon Slager: Yes. The only thing I would say is that keep in mind as -- and we talk about our commodities to basket and OCC is a portion of that basket about 25% also included in there is aluminum and plastics and the pricing on that has actually gone down. Heavy metal, sensitivity really hasn\u2019t changed. Our basket of good $10 change for the year is about $0.03 of EPS.\nSean Eastman: Okay, helpful. And just last quick one from me. I'm just curious on the residential dynamic, you guys highlighted some specific numbers around container rate increases. I'm just curious if you're able to help us understand what that means for the margin profile you guys are getting on that business relative to normalized, this time last year say?\nDon Slager: Yes. So because the disposal is going to be compressed a little bit, but we think it's a temporary issue. And we'll work our way out of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Feniger: This is kind of asked earlier, I might have not heard properly. When a customer opens up, which sounds like you started to see at the end of the month, are they decreasing service levels and pickups versus where they were pre-COVID and are they asking for a relief on that price point? And on this topic, it may be too early, but Chuck, can we see small mom and pop start to get aggressive on that line of business when the economy opens back up?\nDon Slager: Yes. So we're seeing people call back in. We're not seeing meaningful changes when they come back or they're coming back at the same service level. Obviously, it's a mix as we go forward. We've not seen any kind of movement in terms of expecting a different price point. If we have customers who are under contract, and we've allowed them to temporarily pause that contract given the kind of once in a 100 year nature of this phenomenon, and they've been appreciative that we've allowed them to do that.And they\u2019re mindful of their timing and their opening back up, they're eager to get back to business, right? And their first point of interest is not the price point of their waste in recycling service. It's getting their employees back safely and working and getting customers in their door on that front. And then could we see people be aggressive? Yes, we could, we see that all the time in select markets, there always be a player who does a -- how to do a volume grab here or there at a specific time. I think it's too early to tell whether that's going to be a broad trend, but we've not seen any meaningful uptick in that activity in the last six, seven weeks.\nMichael Feniger: Okay, good to hear. And I might have misheard this comment, is the decremental EBITDA margins, do you think 40%, is that the total company, is that collection, disposal, both, in the April comment, I was hoping if you just flush that out for us?\nChuck Serianni: Yes that\u2019s pretty entire company. So if you think about we're losing our volumes on the residential side of the business, right? It's on small container and on the landfill side, and those have the highest margins in the company. So the decremental margins are approximately 40%.\nNicole Giandinoto: But Michael, keep in mind, too, I mean we haven't fully closed the books for April. So, we're talking theoretically what that incremental margin will be. And we'll get more guidance kind of in the second quarter around all the numbers that we've been talking about here.\nMichael Feniger: And just lastly, you mentioned the pipeline with M&A. Are you in active discussions? Are you seeing a recalibration of the multiples in that pipeline? So clearly, the trailing EBITDA gets a haircut post-COVID or in this new environment. I understand that portion. So I'm just curious if you think there's been a recalibration of just the multiples on net EBITDA or that potential future cash flow?\nDon Slager: I'll start and let Jon finish. I would say, first it depends on the deal. It depends on the makeup of the revenue, right? So, yes, we're smart enough to look at that. But it depends on what is the makeup of the business.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. So, our activity remains higher than ever. We're in continued dialogue and discussions. We are not snapping the chalk line on pricing those deals, but we're giving sellers an expectation of ranges. But we're waiting to sit through both things where the economy nets out and what the future demand profile is going to be for those assets. And then, overtime, do multiple expectations come down because there's more willing sellers, because their life has changed and it might be a little tougher to run the business in this environment, we'll see.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Maguire: And appreciate all the detail on trends in April with all the fluid situation here. And I know, guidance has been pulled, it\u2019s a very tough environment to be able to provide any. So, I appreciate given the sort of $1 billion free cash flow marker there. But I'm trying to just reconcile some sort of conflicting talent versus numbers. It seems like April's not as bad as we could have feared, but still obviously not immune to the environment. But really, I'm getting a lot of optimism out of you guys about the pace of the recovery, the ability to maybe even clip the low end of the original free cash range and it's great that sequentially and maybe on a week-over-week basis, things are starting to improve a little bit. But I guess sitting here, how can you have any confidence that we're going to get back to anything close to normal in the back half of the year? I guess, kind of embedded in the question is, there's no way you get to 1 billion kind of at the current run rate, right? I mean, you need a healthy kind of recovery in 3Q and 4Q to get there. So, is there's something you guys are seeing that we're missing that just would explain the heightened confidence to kind of get to whatever level you need to get to even talking about clip in the low end of the prior range?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Look, I'd say the obviously economic outlook broadly, there's still some uncertainty to it, right? And so, if we get into a double dip, right, because we have a reemergence at broad scale and have widespread sheltering in place in the fall, that would be a different scenario. But based on what we're seeing now, and based on we're kind of consensus is going in the macro environment that we're going to have a tough Q2 and start to see growth in Q3 and Q4, coupled with what we're seeing, which is again, relatively high floor to what some of the early predictions were and already seeing that flatten out and starting to see it move upward. I think those are all positive signs and that's what's embedded in our perspective.\nDon Slager: So furthermore, right, for years, decades as we've talked to you, the market about what's great about the waste business. We talk about the same things. We talk about our market position being number one or number two in 90% percent of the revenue. We talk about the fact that we're essential service. We talked about the fact that 80% of our customers are under some type of contract. We talk to you about the fact that in our small container business, even in our residential business, the cost per household in the residential businesses generally sub $35 a month, the cost of small container is sub 400. These are not giant spends, these are not the numbers that keep them awake at night. These are not the major parts of their budgets, right. That's what makes the business great. In fact everyone needs us. Okay. And everyone pays us mostly in advance, right, for the service that we provide and that's one of the reasons that we get to get strong pricing. 4% to 5%, poor pricing or a 3% yield is really a small dollar amount for any business, right. All those things are true, when we talked about 1 billion, how we can flex our cash flow or our spending in times like this to still produce pretty strong free cash and maintain a strong balance sheet and have a balanced approach to cash allocation. All those things that we've been telling you that frankly, we proved in the 2001 economic decline, in the great recession, and we'll prove again now. All those things started to -- that's the truth that we've been telling you. And frankly, I think is maybe going overlooked by some people during the last call it seven, eight weeks of this [madness], but we're going to continue to do that and that's not anything -- that's inconsistent with what we've done or what we\u2019ve said in the past.\nBrian Maguire: And would you tend to agree with you on all those points and just none of us have lived through this and underlying assumption is that those businesses are coming back and continue to operate and that's kind to Michael's question earlier just seems like the big wildcard I think we'd all say. Just on OCC, the price has run up and I just wonder what you could say about volumes and how much of the move higher has been supply shock driven with the new collections from brick and mortar retail and establishment where is usually very higher recovery rates and more consumers through the e-commerce channel and maybe lower recovery rates there. Just kind of really a supply shock driving it higher from what you can tell?\nDon Slager: I mean keep in mind that we're still down slightly, right, because resi\u2019s way up, commercial or small container is down, right. I mean, there's just less economic activity going on right now overall from the supply standpoint. And then obviously from the demand side, the demand signal out of the back door for second process centers, big pull for fiber, both to support e-commerce but also to support all of the Kleenex and paper towel and toilet paper and wipes and everything else you got some of those are just a pull forward of surge in demand. Some of those I would argue are more permanent. Wipes for example, paper towel. I think we're going to have a elevated level of demand for months or probably years to come.\nBrian Maguire: Okay, and just last one from me, I can't remember if somebody already asked it, but just on the capital reallocation, thoughts on the share repo. I think you sound like you're still committed to do M&A although maybe the stuff that due diligence you can't travel. But on the share repo, so expecting to kind of continue at a similar pace or does the uncertainty out there maybe pull back a little bit on that?\nDon Slager: Yes, so I would tell you, first of all our stock is a bargain today, right and we should be buying more of it. But with the uncertainty in the world right now, the prudent thing for us to do is conserve cash, right. So, Chuck talked about having plenty of cash on hand and having plenty of capacity in the revolver. That's the prudent thing for us to do at this moment. Of course, we'd much rather buy more businesses, do more M&A than buy your shares, that's still the best use of cash. So, we're going to take a little wait and see approach. And, as chuck said, we've been paying dividend every quarter for 18 years. So while we don't have an exact dividend policy, we do have a practice that we've honored. So we think we're in a good position from a cash allocation perspective. We look at the intrinsic value of the company today. And if it weren't for some of the uncertainly around COVID-19 we'd be buying a little more of our stocks but we're just going to kind of take a wait and see approach.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Just one from me. Just wondering, as you hope your commercial customers restart here, I suspect a lot of them or some of them are probably facing more financial duress. How do you manage the counter party risk during the event that they can't make it all the way through, are you changing payment terms at all, or like what are you doing to make sure that it don't become an elevated bad debt expense sometime down the road?\nChuck Serianni: Yes, good question. So our perspective does anticipate some elevated bad debt expense that will inevitably be some customers who don't make it through that. I think that's obvious to everybody on the call. But we have a differentiated approach and a very thoughtful one. So customers with good credit ratings get a little bit of help through this, and we will extend terms of those customers. The longer they've been with us, obviously, we'll replay that loyalty to them, and help them get through this time. On that front, feels pretty good about our approach. We have trained all of our people, both in credit collections and all of our customer service representatives, on all those policies and also the approach. People are going through a very dramatic experience. And we start with a human centered approach understanding what they're going through working with them and getting to a good outcome and we have long and loyal customers, over seven years our customers are with us. And so I'm pretty confident we're going to work through this together.\nOperator: At this time, it appears to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nDon Slager: Thank you, Rachel. In closing, given the foundational investments we've made in the business, we've been operating from a position of strength and we will continue to do so through the recovery and beyond. Our diversified footprint across the broad mix of markets nationwide position us well to benefit at each stage of the recovery.We look forward to working together with our customers and our communities, for they resume operations. Once again, I'd like to thank all of the Republic employees for their ongoing hard work, commitment and dedication to our customers and communities. Each of our employee truly embodies that Committed to Serve spirit. Have a good evening everyone and stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Don Slager",
            "content": "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I hope you are doing well and staying safe and healthy. This is of course an unprecedented time for all of us. So before we get into a discussion of our results, I want to first review the steps we are taking in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.As you know, Republic Services provides an essential service. Our team is working tirelessly to serve our customers and communities. And I want to sincerely thank them for all their efforts. As always, the safety and well-being of our people is our top priority. And we are supporting them by continuing to provide all field employees with role specific PPE and masks, implementing enhanced cleaning protocols, adjusting processes, procedures and physical spaces to enable proper social distancing, rebalancing the workload to keep all people working by reducing overtime, providing supplemental paid time off and enhancing medical benefits to cover all COVID related out of pocket costs; and finally, finding new and creative ways to keep our 36,000 employees engaged, motivated and connected.Last month, we launched our $20 million Committed to Serve initiative to recognize our frontline employees, while also helping to support our small business customers and the communities we serve. We are providing weekly on site meals to employees and have sent home weekly dinners for their families. These meals are being purchased from our local small business customers. We are also providing $400 worth of gift cards to each frontline employee to help them and their families. We're encouraging them to use these cards with our small business customers. In doing so, we're not only supporting our people but also our customers by providing them with what they need most, additional revenue.Lastly, we are donating $3 million to the Republic Services Charitable Foundation. Through its National Neighborhood Promise program, the foundation is focused on rebuilding, revitalizing and restoring local communities. The $3 million will be used to fund the foundation's long-term non-profit partners who support local neighborhoods and small businesses as part of their mission.I'm not surprised by our team's ability to quickly mobilize in a time of crisis. Over the past decade, we've been investing in our business to advance our strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. Some of these investments include: developing standardized processes, implementing innovative technology, consolidating our customer service operations, and building a world class procurement organization and business continuity function.Through these investments, we've built a solid foundation, and even more -- and even a more resilient business. These investments were the driving force behind our superior results in 2019, and our strong start to 2020. Importantly, these foundational improvements have enabled us to be more agile as we navigate the current environment. For example, through our investment in innovative routing and workforce planning tools, we've been able to quickly adjust our routes for changes in demand. And our investment in technology and collaboration tools allowed us to successfully transition approximately 6,000 of our people to work-from-home in a matter of days. And we did so without disruption to our customers, or productivity.As you can see, our company was well prepared. Furthermore, our management and business continuity teams are experienced in navigating difficult times. For example, during the great recession, we successfully adjusted our business to changes in demand and continued to generate strong cash flow. And following some of the most tragic weather events such as hurricanes Harvey and Maria, we were the first waste company back up and running in our markets. Fast forward till today, the investments in our people, processes and technology have better prepared us to manage through this unprecedented time. Next, I'd like to give you some perspective of what we are currently seeing in the business.We started the year strong in January and February. In mid March, some customers in our large container and small container businesses began adjusting their service by decreasing the frequency of pickup or temporarily pausing service. Service decreases continued in late March through mid April and have moderated since then. In the last couple of weeks, we've begun to see customers re-engage with us as they plan to reopen their businesses.Assuming these trends continue, we believe the worst is behind us and volumes will sequentially improve from here. This perspective is consistent with current GDP consensus estimates, which call for a decline in the second quarter, and sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters. With this outlook, we can expect to generate over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2020.Lastly, before turning the call over to Jon, I'd like to briefly discuss capital allocation. Despite the current pandemic, our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. We continue to believe that disciplined investment in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value.After investing in growth, we will continue to return our remaining cash flow to shareholders through dividends, and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested over $60 million in acquisitions. Our deal pipeline remains strong, and conversations with potential sellers continue to be active.With that, I'll turn it over to Jon. So, pricing, our pricing perspective remains consistent. We're continuing to invest in our employees and we're continuing price for the quality and committed work that we do with our customers. We have not seen any meaningful change in the market. Now, there's always pockets of behavior here and there, but that's true regardless of where we're at in the economic cycle and again our policies and approaches have remained very consistent. Certainly, it'll definitely be something we're talking about. And right now, as we've kind of come through into May, April has been all about kind of stabilizing the business, making sure that the service level, quality stays high, working with municipalities and any sort of scheduled changes that we need to accomplish. As we assess the additional tons that we have absorbed, we'll begin to talk to municipalities about what that means and look for some help. It's too early to tell yet. We'll give you more color on that once we get into reporting a second quarter. Yes. So we're not seeing anything as of yet. As a matter of fact the DSO went down by half a day, year-over-year, so nothing here in the first quarter. We are thinking that DSO will trickle up during the year and that's already contemplated in our cash flow guidance for the year. Well, I think we said, we still expect to do about a 600, 650 of M&A this year, right?I think somewhere in that area, right? So you can do the math on that. It could be more. I mean we'll see how companies come through this pandemic, but the pipeline is full, our people are involved, Santek is on track. So, we will be good. Yes. Thanks, Hamzah. I think you'll see the pace of the recovery be differentiated based on geography and based on SIC code. So, you could imagine things like hospitality are going to be under pressure and that recovery is going to be a bit slower than manufacturing, which we're already seeing factories start to come back online and reopen and production ramp up. So again, we're going to see differences in that capacity as we go forward. Yes, let me add to that. That was a much different situation too, right? So that was caused by housing but caused by property values crashing, caused by property taxes dropping. The tax base of these municipalities was under pressure. To your point, Hamzah, depending on how this thing bounces back. But if it is some type of a decent U-shape recovery, we're not going to see that kind of an issue, we don't believe. On that we think we've absolutely found the bottom and that's stabilized and starting to see kind of trends of recovery here. You could imagine a temp for example, construction shutdown, Seattle was shutdown, reopened about 10 days ago, the Bay area was shut down in construction, and that begins to ramp up. And we're seeing a number of places that are just going gangbusters. And to Jon's point, while construction was a huge weak spot in the last recession and downturn, I think this is going to turn out to be one of the brighter spots given the housing starts already were at a modest pace and commercial construction still is pretty strong. So, we feel pretty optimistic about that part of the business. I think we've seen there's three things going on. There's customers who have permanently closed and we've seen very little of that, although in fairness still some shifting and sorting out as the economy starts to get some steam back in it. We're seeing customers who have temporarily suspended their service, as they have had shelter-in-place orders and they've had eventually temporarily closed their business. And then we've seen people who have decreased their service where restaurant will be a great example who doesn't have in-room dining but does have takeout. So they may have scaled back their service. We're seeing those customers who have temporary paused their service come back online, and we're seeing now those service increases outpace service decreases in small container, which is a very positive by the way. But as Jon said in his comments, right, attendance is at an all time high. Safety, that's our best safety month ever, and engagement is strong, right? And all those things will be benefits for us. A very strong first quarter in pricing, again. Very consistent with our historic approach and making sure we get paid for the work we do. And have maintained that approach here in the last six, seven weeks, and have not seen meaningful levels of pullback on pricing. Now, our outlook anticipates some of that as people shift through their business as well. So I'm sure we'll see a little bit of that, but I don't anticipate large movements on that front. Yes. I don't think it's a material change. Diligence, for deals we had near closing, diligence has been more difficult because we're not travelling, right? So we've had to maybe slow some of those things down and do some things remotely. That just require a little bit of innovation. But as far as new opportunity goes, I think frankly, as we've said, there are a lot of really good companies out there that we'd like to look at and talk to, some of we already have in the pipeline, there may be some more that come to market, I think for the most part companies have just been busy getting their businesses stabilized.Trying to figure this thing out. And as the market starts to come back, people will start to decide, whether they're still in this for the long-term or not. We know that we are, and we know we've got the balance sheet and the know how to get it done. So we'll be here to have conversations if there are people who want to otherwise. So we think, it'll still be a good year for us in the M&A department. Most of those costs were one-time in nature. So, hundreds of thousands of masks we purchased. We talked about putting some structural changes into our hauling companies to promote social distancing, screening, et cetera. So, feel really good about that. We've already always used masks on our recycling centers. So, yes, we have a little more hand sanitizer spend going forward, certainly will for a long period of time. But that's not meaningful in the overall economics. And keep in mind, Michael, not much came out in resi. Resi, we're working harder than ever. So, almost half in large container and small container. Yes. Look, Michael, as you know, there is a lot of moving parts, right? So, as I said already in April was all about sort of stabilizing the business, right, working with our people, keeping everybody safe. May will be about keeping everybody sort of enthusiastic and ready to return, we're already seeing all these positive signs that Jon laid out. I mean, there's positivity across all lines of business, all market verticals, there's just a lot of really great stories. If we had 4 hours earnings call we can share, we can find really great stuff, it's too soon to trend it. Right. So, that's the difficulty, there's just so many moving pieces. And the fact is that we know that we can make changes in decisions in and around CapEx and other areas of spending, which we've done and are doing and will continue to adjust. But there's still a chance right depending on how this return occurs, then we can still catch the bottom edge of our original cash flow guidance, which is over $1 billion, right.So, we're going to be making adjustments every day, every week for near the end of the year. The leadership team gets together every day at 11:00 AM and reviews every piece of data we have, and it's making decisions daily. And that'll continue under Jon's leadership. So it's been really a great process so far and it seems it's responding great. So, in July we have a lot more data and we'll have some trend information that will be more meaningful, but I would say we're focused on the cash flow and that just really underscores -- helps stability of the business. Sure, maybe I'll start the secondary part of your question. So, retention is at an all time high. We have some natural attrition in the business of retirements and other things, but we don't have a lot of people leaving us for bigger, better opportunities, in part because we have done extraordinary job of taking care of our people, which ties into the first part of your question. The Committed to Serve program was done for a few reasons. One, it was to honor and celebrate our frontline people, right? They perform an essential service and it's a noble purpose, and unfortunately, society doesn't do a great job of recognizing them all the time and this is their moment. This is our opportunity to elevate them and appropriately celebrate them. And then connecting that in with customers, right? Customers obviously are looking for some cost relief, what they really needed revenue and we're allowing our people and empowering our people to go support local small businesses that are our customers and when we do that we support the community. So, we think all of those things are connected and tied together. Yes. The only thing I would say is that keep in mind as -- and we talk about our commodities to basket and OCC is a portion of that basket about 25% also included in there is aluminum and plastics and the pricing on that has actually gone down. Heavy metal, sensitivity really hasn't changed. Our basket of good $10 change for the year is about $0.03 of EPS. Yes. So because the disposal is going to be compressed a little bit, but we think it's a temporary issue. And we'll work our way out of it. Yes. So we're seeing people call back in. We're not seeing meaningful changes when they come back or they're coming back at the same service level. Obviously, it's a mix as we go forward. We've not seen any kind of movement in terms of expecting a different price point. If we have customers who are under contract, and we've allowed them to temporarily pause that contract given the kind of once in a 100 year nature of this phenomenon, and they've been appreciative that we've allowed them to do that.And they're mindful of their timing and their opening back up, they're eager to get back to business, right? And their first point of interest is not the price point of their waste in recycling service. It's getting their employees back safely and working and getting customers in their door on that front. And then could we see people be aggressive? Yes, we could, we see that all the time in select markets, there always be a player who does a -- how to do a volume grab here or there at a specific time. I think it's too early to tell whether that's going to be a broad trend, but we've not seen any meaningful uptick in that activity in the last six, seven weeks. I'll start and let Jon finish. I would say, first it depends on the deal. It depends on the makeup of the revenue, right? So, yes, we're smart enough to look at that. But it depends on what is the makeup of the business. So furthermore, right, for years, decades as we've talked to you, the market about what's great about the waste business. We talk about the same things. We talk about our market position being number one or number two in 90% percent of the revenue. We talk about the fact that we're essential service. We talked about the fact that 80% of our customers are under some type of contract. We talk to you about the fact that in our small container business, even in our residential business, the cost per household in the residential businesses generally sub $35 a month, the cost of small container is sub 400. These are not giant spends, these are not the numbers that keep them awake at night. These are not the major parts of their budgets, right. That's what makes the business great. In fact everyone needs us. Okay. And everyone pays us mostly in advance, right, for the service that we provide and that's one of the reasons that we get to get strong pricing. 4% to 5%, poor pricing or a 3% yield is really a small dollar amount for any business, right. All those things are true, when we talked about 1 billion, how we can flex our cash flow or our spending in times like this to still produce pretty strong free cash and maintain a strong balance sheet and have a balanced approach to cash allocation. All those things that we've been telling you that frankly, we proved in the 2001 economic decline, in the great recession, and we'll prove again now. All those things started to -- that's the truth that we've been telling you. And frankly, I think is maybe going overlooked by some people during the last call it seven, eight weeks of this [madness], but we're going to continue to do that and that's not anything -- that's inconsistent with what we've done or what we've said in the past. I mean keep in mind that we're still down slightly, right, because resi's way up, commercial or small container is down, right. I mean, there's just less economic activity going on right now overall from the supply standpoint. And then obviously from the demand side, the demand signal out of the back door for second process centers, big pull for fiber, both to support e-commerce but also to support all of the Kleenex and paper towel and toilet paper and wipes and everything else you got some of those are just a pull forward of surge in demand. Some of those I would argue are more permanent. Wipes for example, paper towel. I think we're going to have a elevated level of demand for months or probably years to come. Yes, so I would tell you, first of all our stock is a bargain today, right and we should be buying more of it. But with the uncertainty in the world right now, the prudent thing for us to do is conserve cash, right. So, Chuck talked about having plenty of cash on hand and having plenty of capacity in the revolver. That's the prudent thing for us to do at this moment. Of course, we'd much rather buy more businesses, do more M&A than buy your shares, that's still the best use of cash. So, we're going to take a little wait and see approach. And, as chuck said, we've been paying dividend every quarter for 18 years. So while we don't have an exact dividend policy, we do have a practice that we've honored. So we think we're in a good position from a cash allocation perspective. We look at the intrinsic value of the company today. And if it weren't for some of the uncertainly around COVID-19 we'd be buying a little more of our stocks but we're just going to kind of take a wait and see approach. Thank you, Rachel. In closing, given the foundational investments we've made in the business, we've been operating from a position of strength and we will continue to do so through the recovery and beyond. Our diversified footprint across the broad mix of markets nationwide position us well to benefit at each stage of the recovery.We look forward to working together with our customers and our communities, for they resume operations. Once again, I'd like to thank all of the Republic employees for their ongoing hard work, commitment and dedication to our customers and communities. Each of our employee truly embodies that Committed to Serve spirit. Have a good evening everyone and stay safe."

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Don. Because we are an essential service provider, we have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of service. As a result, we were well prepared to face the challenges of pandemic. Our priorities are simple and remain unchanged: put our people first, keep our facilities running smoothly, and take care of our customers. By doing so, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term value for our stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities and shareholders.As Don discussed, we acted quickly to ensure our employees' well-being. I'm immensely proud of how well all of our employees have adjusted to these changes. For example, our drivers have remained engaged and focused during this potentially distracting time. Attendance is at an all time high, and April was our best safety month ever. Productivity and service reliability have also improved. In just three days, we transitioned 98% of our customer service representatives to work-from-home with no disruption to our service to customers.In fact, since moving to an at-home working environment, we've seen a meaningful increase in their productivity. Our first quarter results were strong, despite the headwind in March from the pandemic. We increased revenue 3.4% and expanded underlying EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. In the first quarter, average yield was 2.9% and volumes during the quarter increased 40 basis points. Excluding the benefit from an additional workday in the quarter versus the prior year, volumes decreased by 10 basis points. This included a 70 basis point increase in January and February, which was more than offset by a 1.8% decrease in March.In April, volumes decreased versus the prior year, but the magnitude and rate of change vary by line of business.Looking first at our small container business. In March, as shelter-in-place orders were implemented across the country, service decreases began to outpace service increases. Additionally, container weights started to decline. In April, total yards collected decreased by approximately 11% and container weight decreased by approximately 20%. It's important to note that in the last two weeks, trends have become more favorable. Container waste has started to increase and customers are beginning to resume service as they plan for reopening. In fact, last week, services increases fully offset services decreases.In response to these changes in demand, our local teams are leveraging existing tools and technology to adjust routes and rebalance the workload daily. Impressively, productivity in our small container business improved and over time was down approximately 45%, a true testament to the amazing work that our team is doing.Turning to our large container collection business. In April, recurring large container hauls decreased 19% versus the prior year. And temporary large container hauls decreased 14% versus the prior year. Given the decrease in demand, our teams effectively rebalanced the routes and reduced over time by approximately 50%.Next, turning to our residential collection business. In this line of business, we bill customers based on the container size and frequency of pickup rather than on the weight of the container. As a result, given we are continuing to operate as normal, the pandemic has had minimal impact on our revenue. However, as residents consume more at-home and create more recycling and solid waste, our processing and disposal costs will increase. For the month of April, average container waste increased approximately 15% versus the prior year.Regarding our disposal business. In April, third-party tons decreased by approximately 20% and included a decrease in special waste of 34%, a decrease in C&D of 11% and a decrease in MSW of only 7%. Importantly, the rate of decline has begun to moderate and last week total landfill tons were only down 15% versus the prior year.Turning to recycling. During this crisis, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the environment. Thanks to the hard work and resourcefulness of our procurement and operations teams, I'm proud to report that we've been able to continue to operate our recycling processing centers across the country without any disruption. In a time like this, when e-commerce activity is increasing and the demand for fiber is increasing, it is more important than ever to keep our operations up and running safely. We've implemented social distancing and are providing necessary PPE to keep our people safe and our facilities operational. In those areas where employees are stationed less than [40 to par], we've installed plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe.Regarding our environmental services business. In April, U.S. rig counts and associated drilling activity continued to decrease sequentially from the first quarter. As a result, we expect revenues in the upstream E&P portion of our environmental services business to decrease sequentially. In the downstream portion of this business, we are also seeing headwinds, though not as severe. Downstream operators, including refineries and petrochemical companies usually benefit from lower crude prices providing a natural hedge to the volatility in the upstream portion of our business. However, given the unprecedented low demand for fuel, we expect utilization rates to come down and activity in the downstream portion of our business to decrease sequentially.Finally, turning to expense and CapEx. As we continue to operate during this uncertain time, we are adjusting our cost structure to align with real time changes in volume. Importantly, we estimate approximately 60% of our total cost structure, including cost of operations, SG&A and depreciation and amortization is variable. We are closely managing these variable costs. For example, we've put labor management strategies in place to redistribute the workload. As a result, we've reduced total overtime hours by approximately 37%. We are also reducing discretionary spending such as travel and are scaling back on capital expenditures. For example, approximately 10% of our capital budget or a little over $100 million is for growth capital, which we will no longer need to spend this year.Additionally as volumes decrease, the replacement cycle of our assets naturally extends. Therefore, we are intelligently scaling back our replacement capital to align with changes in demand including the construction of landfill airspace and the purchase of replacement trucks, containers, and equipment. Overall, we have been quickly adapting our operations based on changes in customer demand. As always, we will continue to manage the business for the long-term. We've been very nimble during this rapidly-evolving period and we'll be equally ready as the economy begins to grow again.With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our first quarter results. The only other thing I'd add in that is we have a small number of programs that is based on the weight, they're bag programs, and the industry and we've also migrated away from those programs over the years because they're not easy for the consumer. Having one bin that they pull out to the curb, and having that automated has been safer for us, has been better for the consumer. And you've seen the industry move in that direction. And so whatever we do going forward, we want to make sure that it's still effortless for the customer. Yes, well, unfortunately, Tyler we will probably cover that in July when we talk about Q2. So we can't get into overall April trends. But I would reinforce that in most of the places we think we've seen the bottom and we're starting to see recovery. So it's been a really good sign. And also I'd say that bottom has been a much higher floor than I think we initially expected on that front. So we're feeling pretty positive about the outlook. Yes. Just on that point, I think, obviously that deal is not closed yet. It's going through regulator review. We typically wouldn't comment. But other people have put that out there but we're confident we're going to close that deal in the second half of the year. No, Hamzah, we're not seeing that today, and obviously something we're looking into actively but don't anticipate any credit or collections issues on that side of the business. You know these are long cycle contracts. So, if there's any pressure, it would show up kind of years from now in a bid cycle. And as we've been holding line in that part of the business, making sure that we get a fair return for all the work that we do. Yes. No change to the dividend policy. We've been paying the dividend now for 18 years and that's not going to change. We always say that we would like to deploy our capital by purchasing EBITDA and Don mentioned that our pipeline is very robust right now, our acquisition pipeline. So looking for our capital to work by buying businesses to take advantage of what might be a pretty good opportunity right now. And then finally, returning the rest of the cash that we generate to the shareholders in the form of a share repurchase. So, our capital allocation strategy really hasn't changed. Yes, certainly fuel cost savings is there as oil is at a very low historic level. I would say one of the reasons we've been successful in this environment and the productivity improved is all the hard work and the foundation that we've built. So, we've worked really, really hard to keep our people working and employed and that meant everybody had to give up some overtime so everybody could get work and that means people picking up different routes and our different stops. And again, the customer service has improved, the productivity has improved. So real testament to our COO, Tim Stuart and the operating team for how they've done that with operations. And I'd also say this, we've benefited a bit from traffic, right, as people sheltered in place, traffic is down, especially in urban areas, our ability to get around and get to and back from the recycling side of the landfill has certainly improved. Small, I couldn't give you a absolute number or the percentage number. I think it will be small, Michael. It's hard to forecast exactly what the shape of the recovery is, right? If we're in an L-shape recovery, which I don't think any of us are seeing in our side of the business, yes, it could be that number. But in a kind of a steady rebound here. But I would expect less, but it's hard to say yet. Yes. So, we'll give you more information on that, Michael as we work our way through the year here. It really depends upon the duration of the downturn, how quickly we come back, right? We talked about the growth capital. The remaining capital is really replacement, and it just depends on the utilization of our assets, which includes landfills, right? Building additional landfills airspace, and that's all predicated upon tons that we're receiving into landfill. So, much more information to come here in Q2. Yes. So, our activity remains higher than ever. We're in continued dialogue and discussions. We are not snapping the chalk line on pricing those deals, but we're giving sellers an expectation of ranges. But we're waiting to sit through both things where the economy nets out and what the future demand profile is going to be for those assets. And then, overtime, do multiple expectations come down because there's more willing sellers, because their life has changed and it might be a little tougher to run the business in this environment, we'll see. Yes. Look, I'd say the obviously economic outlook broadly, there's still some uncertainty to it, right? And so, if we get into a double dip, right, because we have a reemergence at broad scale and have widespread sheltering in place in the fall, that would be a different scenario. But based on what we're seeing now, and based on we're kind of consensus is going in the macro environment that we're going to have a tough Q2 and start to see growth in Q3 and Q4, coupled with what we're seeing, which is again, relatively high floor to what some of the early predictions were and already seeing that flatten out and starting to see it move upward. I think those are all positive signs and that's what's embedded in our perspective."

            "name": "Chuck Serianni",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. In the first quarter, total revenue increased by 3.4%. This included average yields of 2.9% and volume growth of 40 basis points. Core price net of rollbacks was 5.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $24 million or 3.4% versus the prior year. Normalizing for an additional workday in the quarter, EBITDA increased 4.8%. Underlying EBITDA margins increased by 30 basis points.Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $267 million and decreased by $82 million versus the prior year. This decrease in free cash flow was due to the timing of capital expenditures in cash taxes. Capital expenditures in the first quarter increased $74 million and cash taxes increased $25 million versus the prior year. Normalizing for these two items, free cash flow would have increased 4.9% versus the prior year. During this unprecedented time, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will continue to have ample liquidity of $1.9 billion.Looking forward, the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy remains uncertain, in particular, the pace and timing of the recovery. As a result, we have decided to suspend our detailed financial guidance for 2020.But as Don and Jon discussed, recent trends are encouraging. The rate of volume declines is slowing and we're beginning to see customers plan for reopening. Our employees have rapidly adjusted to new ways of working to stay safe and are as engaged as ever. Our operations teams are adjusting routes daily to maintain productivity and minimize costs. We're increasing customer loyalty by continuing to provide great service to our customers and investing in our communities. And finally, we are prudently managing spending while continuing to invest for the long-term. Assuming these recent trends continue, we would still expect to generate over $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2020.In closing, we mentioned numerous times the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. But we are all facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty. One thing you can be certain of is the stability and resiliency of Republic Services. In my 20-plus year history with Republic, I've seen many ups and downs, from the great recession to the longest economic expansion in history. What I have learned is that the essential nature of our business doesn't change and what is our ability to generate strong, predictable free cash flow. Remember, the economic environment we're currently in is temporary. And when the economy returns to some level of normalcy, we will emerge stronger than ever.With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions. Yes, you're right, Tyler that 40% is accurate. Yes. So, the $3 million that we incurred during the first quarter were associated with just keeping our employees safe. The commitment to serve actually is a little bit different than that. That's helping the employees, but it's also helping the communities. So, how much we incurred these costs that we carved out in Q1 going forward, really depends on the duration of the pandemic, and how quickly the economy rebounds. It's a little bit too really to be able to forecast that at this point. It's about 15% Michael. Yes. A little less than that, probably closer to 40%. Yes that's pretty entire company. So if you think about we're losing our volumes on the residential side of the business, right? It's on small container and on the landfill side, and those have the highest margins in the company. So the decremental margins are approximately 40%. Yes, good question. So our perspective does anticipate some elevated bad debt expense that will inevitably be some customers who don't make it through that. I think that's obvious to everybody on the call. But we have a differentiated approach and a very thoughtful one. So customers with good credit ratings get a little bit of help through this, and we will extend terms of those customers. The longer they've been with us, obviously, we'll replay that loyalty to them, and help them get through this time. On that front, feels pretty good about our approach. We have trained all of our people, both in credit collections and all of our customer service representatives, on all those policies and also the approach. People are going through a very dramatic experience. And we start with a human centered approach understanding what they're going through working with them and getting to a good outcome and we have long and loyal customers, over seven years our customers are with us. And so I'm pretty confident we're going to work through this together."

Our fourth quarter performance capped off a very strong year financial results and operational execution. We outperformed expectations throughout the year and exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance. During 2021, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.17, which increased 17% over the prior year, produced $1.52 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which increased 23% over the prior year. Expanded EBITDA margin 60 basis points to 30%, improved free cash flow conversion 350 basis points to 44.8% and increased customer retention rates to an all-time high of 95%. Profitable growth remains our strategic priority. And we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long term value. In 2021, we invested over a $1 billion of acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increased free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in recycling and solid waste, and environmental solutions. Yesterday we announced our agreement to acquire US Ecology. This acquisition propels Republic into a leading position in the environmental solutions space, and as a platform of high quality assets and difficult to replicate infrastructure. I will discuss this strategic acquisition in more detail before we open up the call for Q&A. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we returned $800 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We delivered outsized growth and profitability by executing our strategy. Our strategy is supported by three differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. With respect to customer zeal, our customer retention rate remained at a record setting level of 95% and NPS remains well above pre pandemic scores. During the fourth quarter, we deliver an outsize revenue growth throughout the business. Core price reached an all-time high of 5.4% and average yield increase to 3.4%. Volumes increased 3.6% compared to the prior year, and acquisitions contributed an incremental 490 basis points to total revenue growth. Full year combined yield and volume of 6.7% was the highest level in company history, and over 200 basis points above the next highest year of performance. Turning to digital, we continue to make meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of the RISE platform. We've now implemented tablets in approximately 90% of our large and small container fleet. With these new capabilities, we generated operational efficiencies, and delivered over 1 million automated proactive notifications to customers last year. We will begin to point tablets to the residential fleet early this year, and expect to be complete by mid-2023. Next, turning to sustainability. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We expect four of these projects to be completed this year. With another 14 in our pipeline expected to be completed over the next couple of years. We see an opportunity for another 40 projects beyond the current pipeline. We're also making recycling investments beginning in 2022 to afford integrate in the plastics value chain. These investments will provide a platform for future revenue growth with attractive returns and drive a more sustainable role for future generations. We will absorb these investments when our normal level of capital spending. Our sustainability performance continues to be well regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year. Additionally, our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to an A, which is the highest rating in our industry. One of the primary factors leading to the upgrade was an increase in our human capital management score. This reflects our strong culture that embraces inclusion and diversity. These strong financial and operational results would not have been possible without our dedicated employees. In appreciation of their hard work throughout the pandemic, we paid each frontline employee $500 Committed to Serve Award in the fourth quarter. Combined with the award paid in January of 2021, our frontline employees received an additional $1,000 during the year. This brings our total support provided through our Committed to Serve initiative to $50 million since the beginning of the pandemic. This strength of our 2021 results clearly demonstrates our ability to create sustainable value and provides the foundation from which we will continue to grow. That said we expect another strong year of performance in 2022. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.58 to $4.65 and generated adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents high single digit to low double digit growth over our 2021 performance. It's important to note that this guidance as well as any assumptions we discussed in today's call, do not contemplate the impact from the pending acquisition of US Ecology. We will provide updates to our guidance if needed once the transaction closes. I will now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price during the fourth quarter was 5.4%, which included open market pricing of 7% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.6%, large container of 5.6% and residential of 4.8%. Average yield was 3.4%, which represents a 20 basis point increase from our third quarter performance. In 2022, we expect average yield of approximately 3.4%. This is an increase of 50 basis points over our full year 2021 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 3.6%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 4.6% and increase in large container of 3.7% and an increase in landfill of 6.7%. We expect organic volume growth in a range of 1.5% to 2% in 2022, which remains well above our long-term average. Moving on recycling. Commodity prices were $218 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compares to $110 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 110 basis points to internal growth during the fourth quarter. We are assuming $187 per ton for recycled commodities in 2022, which is consistent with the full year 2021 average. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $65 million from the prior year. This was driven by organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same store basis Environmental Solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 28.1%. This compared to 29.9% in the prior years, margin performance during the quarter was impacted by a 70 basis point headwind from higher incentive compensation expense, and we expect incentive compensation expense will return to target levels. Margin performance also included a 50 basis point dilutive impact from recent acquisitions, which included deal and transition costs. It should be noted that we pulled forward certain integration costs originally planned for 2022. The remaining impact of margin was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in risk management costs. The current period includes a one-time true up for an insurance captive net increased expense 20 basis points in the prior year included a 30 basis point favorable reduction in reserves which did not repeat. We expect risk management expense in 2022 to be relatively flat with our full year 2021 performance. For reference purposes, fourth quarter margin performance at target levels of incentive compensation and excluding the one-time Committed to Serve payment would have been 29.4%. The remaining difference to prior your margin performance relates to the impact of recent acquisitions. SG&A during the fourth quarter was 10.6% of revenue. This represents an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, which was driven by higher incentive compensation approvals previously discussed. Full year 2021 EBITDA margin up 30% expanded 60 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from pricing levels in excess of cost inflation and effective cost management, which demonstrates our ability to gain operating leverage in the business. To put our operating leverage in the context, we estimate wage inflation net of productivity was approximately 3%. Our average yield of 3.4% more than covers this level of cost inflation, which is why labor and maintenance were both down as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter and for the year. In 2022, we expect EBITDA margin will continue to improve and our targeting margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points over our full year 2021 performance. The components of expected margin expansion include pricing in excess of cost inflation, adding 60 to 70 basis points, and incentive compensation expense returning to target levels, adding 50 basis points, partially offset by acquisitions decreasing margin by 40 basis points and net fuel decreasing margin by 40 basis points. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.2% for the year. We expect DD&A as a percentage of revenue of approximately 11.5% in 2022. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.52 billion and increased $279 million or 23% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and a reduction in interest expense resulting from refinancing debt. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion increased 350 basis points to 44.8%. We are targeting high 40% level conversion within the next couple of years. Total debt was $9.6 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio was 2.9x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and noncash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 24% during the fourth quarter. This was in line with our expectations and resulted in a 26% equivalent tax impact for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2022, made up of an effective tax rate of 21% and approximately $120 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Let me now turn it back over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Brian. Before we open up a call, let me provide a little more color on our recent announcement. With the addition of US Ecology\u2019s national footprint of vertically integrated assets, leading disposal infrastructure and comprehensive capabilities, we are better positioned to serve our customers with one of the most complete sets of products and services. This strategic acquisition provides a platform for additional organic and acquisitive growth, with cross selling opportunities for existing customers who want a single partner to manage their environmental service\u2019s needs. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and free cash flow and to create significant value with double digit returns for our shareholders. We are excited to welcome Us Ecology\u2019s talented employees to the Republic team and expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter of this year. Expanding our environmental solutions business is a strategic priority. And this acquisition is a key addition. That said the investments we are making are not limiting growth or reducing focus in the traditional recycling and solid waste businesses. This is not an either or but both and approach. We plan to make outsize investments in both businesses to accelerate growth and create lasting value. We remain disciplined allocators of capital and will only make investments in organic growth opportunities and M&A that increases intrinsic value and improves returns. With that operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks so much. I'm sure there'll be a bunch of questions about US Ecology. But I'd like to focus on the core business for now. And starting with pricing. Notice the yield was really strong, especially at a full year basis. But that core price you called out at an all-time high with noting, the yield was very strong in collection. Just what's your view on post collection pricing and yield going into 2022? Do we start to see that a nudge up as well? Because certainly there's rising operating expenses there just like there is everywhere else.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, certainly, you'll see some momentum in the first couple of quarters. And I think you'll see that momentum accelerate in the second half of the year, a lot of those customers are attached to CPI or something a derivative CPI. And like our collections business, there's 12 to 18 month lag, so that elevated print from the last year will then start to flow through, and you'll see really nice economics on the yield side, especially in Q3 and Q4.\nNoah Kaye: That's super helpful. And that leads into next question was really how to think about the readability or the cadence of yield trends over the course of the year. I know you're not like some peers, and you tend to do your PIs rapidly through the year. So is that 3.4%, full year number, since you're doing 3.4% here in the fourth quarter, is that fairly smooth and stable over the balanced years? Anything that you would call out?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, the same thing, which is the portion of our book that's attached to CPI or something related to that, you will get more momentum in the second half. So I think you'll see really good pricing numbers here in Q1 and Q2. And then you'll see that start to accelerate in Q3 and Q4, the open market side will end up being more ratable, with the caveat that we're living in a very dynamic world, right, and we see inflationary costs inflationary pressure, right, the core thesis of this business is that we are going to price ahead of our cost, right? We did a great job of that last year as costs start to accelerate in pockets. And we'll do the same thing this year. Nothing broad based, right. We look at every market uniquely and dynamically and make sure that our people are getting paid. And then again, we're pricing ahead of our costs.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. And one more to sneak in. And Brian, you call this out. But I want to go back to because I think it's important, just around the margins and the impact from the hire incentive comp and the bonuses, I think, you said it was 130 bps.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes.\nNoah Kaye: So just, a, was that, and how much of that was anticipated and b, when you talk about that sort of being a tailwind to March this next year, I guess how do you think of that in the context of continued support for the labor force given the tight labor market and of course ongoing support amid the COVID pandemic, which is still, although easing with us.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, let me kind of talk about the incentive compensation piece first and then we can talk about the Committed to Serve award. So clearly, from an incentive compensation perspective, we put a plan together that assumes target, right. And as you've seen all year long, we've outperformed. And with that came additional incentive compensation accruals which will be expensed or were expensed in \u201821, the cash for that will be paid in \u201822, which is one of the reasons when you take a look at our free cash flow, the growth on a more normalized basis is actually even in excess of what we're presenting, because we've got to absorb that extra cash payment in the first quarter. On the Committed to Serve again, that was a discretionary item, right, that we decided to do, certainly in recognition for the hard work that our frontline employees did during the pandemic. But we are not planning on making any of those additional or incremental awards of going forward.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Largely because that's baked into the plan, right, we've got elevated increases for all of our frontline people given it\u2019s an inflationary environment. And again, we're pricing ahead of that. And even with that plan, we're planning to expand margins. So that's why we assume that, again, as the situation moves and becomes dynamic, we'll adjust accordingly.\nNoah Kaye: Dynamic is definitely the right word. I\u2019ll turn it over Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Can talk about the cadence of the margin expansion that you folks are looking for over the course of the year, obviously the fourth quarter will have the easy comp that you just mentioned. But what about as we head into the first quarter, if we apply normal seasonality, it looks like your margins might be starting to year down 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter unless we get outsized pricing contribution, is that right? Can you just talk about the cadence of the year-over-year margin performance that you're looking for?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, Jerry, you're on the right path there. I would say in 2022, we're expecting normal seasonality with respect to both the revenue as well as the EBITDA margin, I think when you look at the last two years, right, so \u201820, and \u201821, you had anything but normal, right? So you really have to go back and look at that seasonal cadence prior to that, which again, when you think about a seasonally we tend to see our highest revenue margin performance in the third and second quarters, Q4 thereafter. And then usually Q4 is a little bit the lightest for the year, really, for two reasons, you've got the winter months. So you're not seeing that uptick in particular landfill volumes, as well as you've got the highest percentage of taxes in the first quarter. Payroll taxes, right, yes.\nJerry Revich: Yes, appreciate it. And then separately on the acquisition announcement, can you talk about the path to get to double digit returns what amount of bolt-on activity do we need? Or how much more do we have to go from a synergy standpoint to earn that double digit return that typically for transactions that size takes most companies at least three to five years to get to.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, no, that double digit return is based on the current pro forma, which again, is on the $40 million of cost synergies, which don't include any of the revenue synergies including cross-sell, or bolt-on acquisitions, which we have a number in the pipeline down the road, so that would all those things will be opportunities to accelerate, get to double digit more quickly and then accelerate the overall returns to even higher level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon. Just real quick, Brian, but to be clear, the margins in \u201822 are assuming a normal like 100% incentive comp accrual?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: That's correct.\nTyler Brown: Okay.\nJon Vander Ark: Hold the fire. Yes, we'll take, Tyler, but we're planning on 100% that is correct.\nTyler Brown: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then I know while we're on the talk of margin here, I know in the US Ecology release, you laid out that 47% free cash flow conversion by \u201824. But you didn't really make any mention of the margin targets. Now I get it that US Ecology is probably, I'm going to say 70-80 basis points dilutive to margins, but that does \u2013 does anything preclude you from a treat achieving those call it 32% margins longer term? And is that something that investors should still think could be a reasonable expectations like mid-decade?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, Tyler, absolutely in the solid waste and recycling side, right? We're on our marks, right? And we're going to get there. And you're right, this acquisition right in this space in general has a slightly different value creation formula a little bit lower margins, but less capital intensity, right. And so that starts to converge more into free cash flow conversion, you'll see us move later in the year to segment reporting, right, that calls those things out and really makes it clear to the investment community, what kind of progress we're making on each front. And so just arithmetically right, we'll get there just slightly slower than we would have otherwise. But our sights are still set toward that target overtime.\nTyler Brown: Okay, yes, segment detail would be helpful. And then Jon, I think it was only 90 days ago, though, you mentioned that you wanted to get environmental services up to $1 billion franchise, over I think the next like three years, clearly pro forma, this is going to get you there. You mentioned a platform for deals in the release, you mentioned it again, on this call, but like, where do you envision the business longer term? Are you targeting a certain percentage of sales that you maybe don't want to exceed or just big picture there?\nJon Vander Ark: No, listen, we're -- this deal, right, is a very unique set of assets, right? And gives us a really attractive position, right? And we don't think there's deal of a size or scale right out there in the future, and we're certainly going to take this, should we be able to close it and integrate it, get our people connected the systems, right, make sure that we're executing above the pro forma, right. And then along the way, of course, there's other deals that can fold into this, while we're aggressively growing, right, the solid waste and recycling business. So we don't have any defined target of what percentage of the business this is. But the bulk of this business, just arithmetically is going to be our traditional recycling and solid waste business. And we're going to continue to kind of grow both sides of that as we move forward.\nTyler Brown: Okay, and then by last one, just real quick. You talked about the $40 million of synergies from the deal, but you never really put a finer point there. So where exactly are these synergies coming from? Are they more SG&A? Are they other operating costs? Are they even CapEx?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: No, it's too broad fronts, think about half of it as a duplicative corporate costs, right? This is costs of being a public company, IR treasury and all the normal things that you would think to take out and then the other $20 million would come more at the field level because you see, we have a Gulf Coast region, right? We have a Northeast Region and environmental solutions business, right. They have a national footprint. And we'll obviously think about harmonizing and integrating those. Right, that's a relatively small number, right? When you think about it in terms of cost takeout, because we think this is a huge platform for growth for us, right? We're not going into cut and flip or buying to keep and build. Now, as we go and we learn more, if there's more opportunities to do things a bit more efficiently, we'll certainly take advantage of that.\nTyler Brown: Okay, all right. Appreciate the time.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes and I think Tyler the other thing we do just the $40 million is exclusively cost synergies, there are no revenue synergies baked into the plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much. How to ask two questions and get 10 of a minute. You ended the year at 44% free cash flow conversion, your guidance is up almost nine. But cash flow from ops are only up about 5.5, capital spending is almost flat. So I'm trying to understand what's happening in capital spending. What do you think the cash conversion ratio does in \u201822? And is the cash flow from ops as a percentage of revenues kind of the same in \u201822? As it was in \u201821? How was that to combine on question?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, so Mike, let me kind of put it to you this way here. And I mentioned that we've got the additional cash incentive compensation that we're paying in \u201822. That's related to \u201821 performance. It's about $40 million of extra cash, which impacts free cash flow conversion by 100 basis points. So we think we're going to be able to from overall perspective, get to that 45% plus even absorbing that $40 million extra that extra 100 basis points of free cash flow conversion.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And that'll show up in the cash flow from ops number.\nJon Vander Ark: That\u2019s cash for ops, right and working capital where you see it.\nTyler Brown: Right. And then what -- why is capex relatively flat year-over-year?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, remember we talked about in the current year, right? So again, if you take a look at our original guide, and then what we ultimately spent at the midpoint of that we were kind of $90 million more of CapEx. So we had the ability one to fund additional growth. So again, let's take a look at our volume performance. So from an organic perspective, we had additional growth opportunities, as well as pulled forward some capital that was originally going to be spent in \u201822. So that's why it's relatively flat in \u201822, is because some of that spending actually happened in \u201821.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it. That's what I thought it was. Just wanted to make sure that was clear. And then, Jon, I think it is important for everybody to understand that don't focus on margins focus on the discipline of Republic's cash on cash returns. And just to put it in perspective, I mean you now have about $1.3 billion in ES revenues. And what do you got maybe, two, if you get US Ecology close, two and a $2.5 billion invested. And all like-to-like basis, the same investment is probably 2x on a per revenue basis in garbage. So that's the way people want to put it in perspective, am I thinking about that correctly.\nJon Vander Ark: Well, I probably have to do a little math offline, Michael to confirm or deny your thesis. But I think broadly speaking, you're in the right zone, which is people get very caught up in the margin. And listen, we understand the margin as a way to measure the business. And we don't run away from that, we own that. And we've done a great job of expanding margins the last couple years, right, kind of creeping up on 300 basis points as we get into next year, right. But we don't run the business for the core, we don't run it for any single metric, we run it for the long term and intrinsic value. So that's where cash on cash returns. And that's where value creation comes in. And so business that might have a slightly different optics, which is structurally a little less, lower margin. And then but less capital intensity, that free cash flow conversion is a better metric that serves to harmonize those two things, and get much closer to returns or a view toward returns. And, look, we think there's margin opportunity in this business, right? We think that we're going to continue to look for efficiencies, and we're going to think about make sure that we take our mindset around revenue management and our skills and capabilities and our belief that we have to price out of our cost, right and be expanding margins that allows us to reinvest in the business, right and take care of our customers over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So just touching on that. I know, you just kind of said it. The answer to my question being how do you grow margin? And how do you take advantage of that margin opportunity in the environmental services business? You said, both synergy and pricing, but if you were to kind of frame it, is it 50:50? Or is it really a business that needs to be repriced and properly priced to get those margins up? And/or is it more on the cost energy side that you're looking to get those margins higher?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I talked about the $40 million that we have right in front of us. And then of course, as we go, and we'll look for opportunities, now, we're acquiring not just assets we are acquiring deep expertise, right in the hazardous waste value chain, and around compliance and operations and commercial capabilities. And so we're very, very mindful of that. And the last thing I want to do is step over a $20 bill to grab a nickel. So we're not going to be very short term focus, we're going to think about long term. And as we find more and learn more, right, we'll certainly report out on that. On the revenue side, but we haven't put anything into the pro forma, right, we see opportunities across multiple fronts. And strategically, the reason that we're into this business is because of the connectivity of solid waste, and recycling customers that have asked us to go here, they want a one stop shop, they want somebody who we now think we will have the leading set of products and services in the environmental services space to serve our customers. So the cross-sell opportunities become immediate, and we've seen that with ACV and any other previous acquisition that we've done in this space. We talked about the following acquisitions and that being a real opportunity. We think there are really interesting capital investment opportunities on the post collection side of that business that allow us to compete more broadly right across incineration some other parts of the value chain we're excited about. And then plus we will bring our skill and capability of revenue management to the table understanding that there is no work for free. So we'll look at every individual job that we do and make sure there's sufficient returns on that over time again, that becomes important to allow us to pay our people and to reinvest in the business. And we haven't quantified any of those yet, right, because we're thinking concentrate, and hopefully closing this transaction and integrating our colleagues. But we think there's a lot of upside over time.\nWalter Spracklin: That's great color. And then my second question here is on scalability of future acquisitions, what solid waste versus the environmental services side? Is environmental services, is that a much more scalable? Where integration of acquisitions, future acquisitions is better, it's easier to integrate, it's much more upside, is that rather that way on solid waste more. So I'm looking to gauge where your opportunity set and incremental dollar will be spent now, if there's a lot bigger opportunity in one of the buckets through acquisitions than the other one?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, I think the great news is that we're not capital constrained, right? So that we don't to have $1 and choose where to put it. We look strategically, where's the fit? And does it meet our discipline returns criteria. And then if it's both we invest in both over time, I think this space looks very similar to what's always in recycling look like a decade or more ago where there's a lot of fragmentation. And we've already seen this rolling in smaller players, right provides a ton of synergy. And we've got a pipeline that we see some sometimes building on a regional footprint, sometimes it's adding even further adding your product and service offering that will be great fits. And our pipeline and acquisitions is robust on both fronts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to make sure I understand the price versus underlying inflation expectations over the course of the year. So if we're expecting 60 to 70 bps of margin expansion from pricing ahead of cost inflation, the average yield guidance is 3.4%. Does that mean we have 2.75% inflation kind of assumed or maybe just helped me understand that -- those assumptions?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, so Sean, remember one of the things you have to remember when we disclose average yield, we're using total revenue as the denominators, when you take a look about where we price and you look in that solid waste business, if you did an unrelated business, it would actually be 70 basis points higher than our 2021 performance and about 20 to 30 basis points higher than on total revenues. So that's the way you have to put it into context. So the 3.4%, you got to make 3.6% or 3.7% call it based on related revenues. And you look at that pricing in excess of cost inflation that would imply closer to a 3%, inflation, cost inflation.\nSean Eastman: Okay.\nJon Vander Ark: Kind of wage and benefit number, there's probably slightly higher, keep in mind, we're not talking a lot about it, but we're still getting a lot of productivity benefits to RISE. And that's one of the great stories through the pandemic is it's allowed us to pay keep paying our people as their bills go up, while managing the cost structure because we're just getting more efficient at the work.\nSean Eastman: Okay, great. Yes, I'm glad we flesh that out, very helpful. And maybe just on Us Ecology, in light of your comments around environmental solutions, being less capital intensive, but also mentioning that there are some interesting CapEx opportunities around this particular acquisition. I mean and then there's been seems like, there's been a lot of noise around the US Ecology, capital spending historically. So, I mean, what should we expect as a baseline and sort of variability around CapEx from Us Ecology?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, look, I think there's been some elevated capital with respect to building out right, some landfill. So through the cycle, we would expect the capex to run circa 9% of revenue or so on that business. And again, it's going to be less than that in that 4% to 5% range on the field services piece and a little bit more on that Waste Solutions piece. But on average call about 9%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, thank you very much. I just had a question around as you think about synergies on revenue, from haz waste and solid waste, do you have a sense of how many customers can subscribe to sort of both services? And then also in the past there's been people that have looked at medical waste and solid waste together. And that hasn't worked quite worked out. What's different about this space? Do you have a lot of manufacturing customers that sort of, are asking you to do both? Just give us a sense of revenue synergies? You don't have to quantify it just help us understand that?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. So I think versus your previous thesis, I think, when you start with this sounds like an interesting bundle, let me try to go sell it right, that may or may not work, right, we start with asking the customer, what they want, what they need, and how they want to buy, and have worked our way back into this. So it's true, certainly for our broad set of industrial customers, right, who produce an ongoing recurring set of waste streams. And this really has accelerated over the last decade, they want fewer people into their plants. And second, they're like taking a very hard look at the sustainability footprint of their supply base, right, that's a big part of their sustainability story. And so people who have the ratings we have who have the record, we have become really meaningful for them. And keep in mind, we're still a very, very small percentage of their overall cost structure. So the idea that they'd be willing to pay a little bit more for somebody who can handle their needs compliantly and provide the speed they need, right? That's the value proposition. And that's what we've seen proven out with the ACB transaction immediately, right. And we think we'll get that to just at a much bigger scale with a US Ecology transaction. It also applies to some event type work. I think about the infrastructure bill and brownfield sites remediation, the same thing, you have a contractor there, but who's really unwatched to understand speed, and a single provider that can handle all the different waste streams becomes a really big strategic advantage.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. So can you give us a sense of post US Ecology? What is your market share in haz waste? And where do you think it can go? And do you -- I know Us Ecology is heavy on landfills, they're heavy on event work. They have this NRG business that they over levered to buy, how are you thinking about the portfolio? Does incineration matter or not? Does haz waste landfills mean more? Is NRG a good business? Just walk us through like how you're thinking about the portfolio? Because they do have a few businesses? And haz waste is obviously, a very big market that has a number of other players and also the captive incinerators. It's very different than solid waste, as you obviously already know.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, sure. So I mean, it starts with their historic bid, this was a really in the post collection, hazardous landfill site, they have TFTs intended bands and other things around that. But those five sites, right, give them about a 36% market share position, right in hazardous post collection, right? That's when the strength of their business really, really strong. And we're excited about that. They bought a company called NRC, which has largely field services, which the thesis of which is getting close to the customer, we believe and agree with that thesis, right. And we've seen that and prove that out that that works. Right. We were there with the ACD deal. And we see that in our Gulf Coast region as well over time, that NRC transaction brought with it a couple of other types of businesses, they've got a little bit business in Europe, and they've got some things, marine standby business focuses on oil spill recovery, right? Those are things that we'll go in and quickly take a look at and evaluate and understand, hey, what is the -- what's the fit with the rest of the business? Is it connected from a customer standpoint, from an asset sharing standpoint, I take a very fair view of this something we think we can build and grow will be excited about it. Or if this is something that might be a little more standalone and not very scalable, and somebody else might be the more natural owner of that will of course evaluate that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Chang with CIBC.\nKevin Chang: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question here. You [Indiscernible] out, you talked about some of these revenue synergies and as you build up your environmental solutions, capabilities, the vertical integration, and I guess you spoke a little bit about this. What does the customer get out of it? It sounds like you might give them better service under one umbrella? And maybe it's just not clear to me why that would be. But do they also have like a cost savings? Like does a bundle program offer a level of pricing discount that they wouldn't get it? These are two different vendors, just what does the customer get out of this having this all come out of Republic versus maybe dealing with Us Ecology and Republic separately, let's say?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I know the thesis and it's true in some industries, where hey, the more you put together, the more you bundle, the more price pressure you could be under. And we see this in our business today, actually, that the more products a customer and services a customer buy the average price per product or service goes up, not down, right. And keep in mind waste and recycling broadly, are a very, very, very small portion of a customer's cost structure. If you run a manufacturing facility, you think first about all of your direct costs could be steel, or copper, anything else, and then you think about your labor, and then you think about your SGA costs of IT and everything else. Waste and Recycling, right? We're talking about basis points, right on someone's overall cost structure. So a small price premium on a very small number is still a very, very small number. So for them, it's around compliance, right? Think about producer liability, right? When they produce a waste stream, especially more complex and complicated ones, they have the liability of that forever. So having somebody who's going to handle that in a sustainable and appropriate manner is of enormous value to them, the speed right of being able to get things out of their facility, and keep the container empty, because a full container can sometimes shut down the manufacturing process. So there's enormous value created by speed, ease of service, right, digital interface, and billing. And those are all pieces that we start to put together for people. So that's the value proposition for customers.\nKevin Chang: No, that's a great clarification answer. And as you know, the compliance has got to be a big part of the value proposition. My second question, maybe it's more of a philosophical question. But the industry and you're seeing it yourself, you're getting strong pricing, the covering inflation, the churn is at record lows as well, so you kind of get the best of both worlds. But I guess what trend level would force you to reevaluate your pricing strategies, you said 95%, I think it\u2019s a Q4 number like, at what point or what level of churn would you read things the pricing, you're putting out into the market in order to maintain a certain level of market share or volume?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, we look at that all the time, right, we understand and we're very sophisticated pricing, both pricing new customers, as well as pricing existing customers. And the latter becomes more important for us, obviously, because we have such a long customer tenure, right? That's what that high customer retention drives are underneath that is long customer tenure. And so we have all kinds of experiences with customers around test and learn, right, we take A and B sampling, in terms of understanding a price that customers are willing to pay, and then at what price does that start to drive churn, right and start to drive defection. And there's an incredible amount of science underneath that process that's been developed over the last two decades. So it's really not the top down number we look at. And if we go 92, we change pricing across the board or the opposite direction, right? It's much more surgical almost at a customer by customer level, right. And that's what produces the pricing number while driving great volume growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Yes, thank you very much. Two quick ones here. Jon, you mentioned at the beginning something about forward integrating into the plastics supply chain, could you tell me what that means? I'm completely clueless about that. And second, on the eco deal. It looks like margins, free cash flow and returns are lower than core Republic were out of the box here, organic growth may be a little bit more attractive and the platform for bolt-on acquisitions seems to be one of the best attributes of it. Could you just compare and contrast sort of the pipeline at eco, you've gone through your due diligence, talk to them about deals versus what you know about the average MSW deal.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, sure. So on plastics, listen, the world has a single use plastics problem, right? And you don't have to read too many websites or magazines or watching the television shows to figure that out. Now, it's very different nature of those firms are very different across geography. But in the US, the problem is right circularity right, we produce single use water bottles or anything else. And we don't capture enough of those. And that plastic ultimately gets lost or gets downgraded, right. And there's huge pressure on the CPG companies to drive more reusable product. And rather than just using virgin plastic, and the constraint, and all this is aggregation, and supply. And so we are uniquely positioned in the value chain, because we have that material. Today, that value chain isn't very well constructed. So you have products that moves very inefficiently, we sell that product for a relatively low value for what it's ultimately worth, when it returns into the hands of the CPG companies. So a lot of dialogue, a lot of discussion going on across every stage of the value chain, right. But we think where we've got an opportunity to take a next step, and move forward with some pretty simple processing, that is going to allow us to capture a higher selling price, and take more volatility right out of those sales through longer term contracting. I'm not going to get any more detail right now than that. But stay tuned here, because I think in the next few months, you're going to hear far more color on that topic And then on Us Ecology, listen, we have a really robust and capable business development team, both out and geographically dispersed, as well as here in Phoenix that maintains a perspective on every company big and small, and builds a pipeline. So we've been working on this for years on the environmental solution side of the business. And have we're very disciplined buyers, very patient, but we've had discussions right with dozens of companies. So this isn't talking to Us Ecology and saying what's in your pipeline, of course, we'll do that. But we have our own robust pipeline, right that we know will fit in well, right to the US Ecology platform, right post closing. At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll now turn back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Sara. In closing the strength of our 2021 performance demonstrates the power of our platform, and the value our strategic investments are creating. We exceeded our upwardly revised financial goals by delivering double digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. We continue to manage the business well to create long-term value for all stakeholders and expect continued profitable growth in 2022. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our customers. Results like these are made possible by our team of dedicated employees. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter performance capped off a very strong year financial results and operational execution. We outperformed expectations throughout the year and exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance. During 2021, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.17, which increased 17% over the prior year, produced $1.52 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which increased 23% over the prior year. Expanded EBITDA margin 60 basis points to 30%, improved free cash flow conversion 350 basis points to 44.8% and increased customer retention rates to an all-time high of 95%. Profitable growth remains our strategic priority. And we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long term value. In 2021, we invested over a $1 billion of acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increased free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in recycling and solid waste, and environmental solutions. Yesterday we announced our agreement to acquire US Ecology. This acquisition propels Republic into a leading position in the environmental solutions space, and as a platform of high quality assets and difficult to replicate infrastructure. I will discuss this strategic acquisition in more detail before we open up the call for Q&A. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we returned $800 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We delivered outsized growth and profitability by executing our strategy. Our strategy is supported by three differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. With respect to customer zeal, our customer retention rate remained at a record setting level of 95% and NPS remains well above pre pandemic scores. During the fourth quarter, we deliver an outsize revenue growth throughout the business. Core price reached an all-time high of 5.4% and average yield increase to 3.4%. Volumes increased 3.6% compared to the prior year, and acquisitions contributed an incremental 490 basis points to total revenue growth. Full year combined yield and volume of 6.7% was the highest level in company history, and over 200 basis points above the next highest year of performance. Turning to digital, we continue to make meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of the RISE platform. We've now implemented tablets in approximately 90% of our large and small container fleet. With these new capabilities, we generated operational efficiencies, and delivered over 1 million automated proactive notifications to customers last year. We will begin to point tablets to the residential fleet early this year, and expect to be complete by mid-2023. Next, turning to sustainability. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We expect four of these projects to be completed this year. With another 14 in our pipeline expected to be completed over the next couple of years. We see an opportunity for another 40 projects beyond the current pipeline. We're also making recycling investments beginning in 2022 to afford integrate in the plastics value chain. These investments will provide a platform for future revenue growth with attractive returns and drive a more sustainable role for future generations. We will absorb these investments when our normal level of capital spending. Our sustainability performance continues to be well regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year. Additionally, our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to an A, which is the highest rating in our industry. One of the primary factors leading to the upgrade was an increase in our human capital management score. This reflects our strong culture that embraces inclusion and diversity. These strong financial and operational results would not have been possible without our dedicated employees. In appreciation of their hard work throughout the pandemic, we paid each frontline employee $500 Committed to Serve Award in the fourth quarter. Combined with the award paid in January of 2021, our frontline employees received an additional $1,000 during the year. This brings our total support provided through our Committed to Serve initiative to $50 million since the beginning of the pandemic. This strength of our 2021 results clearly demonstrates our ability to create sustainable value and provides the foundation from which we will continue to grow. That said we expect another strong year of performance in 2022. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.58 to $4.65 and generated adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents high single digit to low double digit growth over our 2021 performance. It's important to note that this guidance as well as any assumptions we discussed in today's call, do not contemplate the impact from the pending acquisition of US Ecology. We will provide updates to our guidance if needed once the transaction closes. I will now turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Brian. Before we open up a call, let me provide a little more color on our recent announcement. With the addition of US Ecology's national footprint of vertically integrated assets, leading disposal infrastructure and comprehensive capabilities, we are better positioned to serve our customers with one of the most complete sets of products and services. This strategic acquisition provides a platform for additional organic and acquisitive growth, with cross selling opportunities for existing customers who want a single partner to manage their environmental service's needs. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and free cash flow and to create significant value with double digit returns for our shareholders. We are excited to welcome Us Ecology's talented employees to the Republic team and expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter of this year. Expanding our environmental solutions business is a strategic priority. And this acquisition is a key addition. That said the investments we are making are not limiting growth or reducing focus in the traditional recycling and solid waste businesses. This is not an either or but both and approach. We plan to make outsize investments in both businesses to accelerate growth and create lasting value. We remain disciplined allocators of capital and will only make investments in organic growth opportunities and M&A that increases intrinsic value and improves returns. With that operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Yes, certainly, you'll see some momentum in the first couple of quarters. And I think you'll see that momentum accelerate in the second half of the year, a lot of those customers are attached to CPI or something a derivative CPI. And like our collections business, there's 12 to 18 month lag, so that elevated print from the last year will then start to flow through, and you'll see really nice economics on the yield side, especially in Q3 and Q4. Yes, the same thing, which is the portion of our book that's attached to CPI or something related to that, you will get more momentum in the second half. So I think you'll see really good pricing numbers here in Q1 and Q2. And then you'll see that start to accelerate in Q3 and Q4, the open market side will end up being more ratable, with the caveat that we're living in a very dynamic world, right, and we see inflationary costs inflationary pressure, right, the core thesis of this business is that we are going to price ahead of our cost, right? We did a great job of that last year as costs start to accelerate in pockets. And we'll do the same thing this year. Nothing broad based, right. We look at every market uniquely and dynamically and make sure that our people are getting paid. And then again, we're pricing ahead of our costs. Yes, let me kind of talk about the incentive compensation piece first and then we can talk about the Committed to Serve award. So clearly, from an incentive compensation perspective, we put a plan together that assumes target, right. And as you've seen all year long, we've outperformed. And with that came additional incentive compensation accruals which will be expensed or were expensed in \u201821, the cash for that will be paid in \u201822, which is one of the reasons when you take a look at our free cash flow, the growth on a more normalized basis is actually even in excess of what we're presenting, because we've got to absorb that extra cash payment in the first quarter. On the Committed to Serve again, that was a discretionary item, right, that we decided to do, certainly in recognition for the hard work that our frontline employees did during the pandemic. But we are not planning on making any of those additional or incremental awards of going forward. Yes, Jerry, you're on the right path there. I would say in 2022, we're expecting normal seasonality with respect to both the revenue as well as the EBITDA margin, I think when you look at the last two years, right, so \u201820, and \u201821, you had anything but normal, right? So you really have to go back and look at that seasonal cadence prior to that, which again, when you think about a seasonally we tend to see our highest revenue margin performance in the third and second quarters, Q4 thereafter. And then usually Q4 is a little bit the lightest for the year, really, for two reasons, you've got the winter months. So you're not seeing that uptick in particular landfill volumes, as well as you've got the highest percentage of taxes in the first quarter. Payroll taxes, right, yes. Yes, no, that double digit return is based on the current pro forma, which again, is on the $40 million of cost synergies, which don't include any of the revenue synergies including cross-sell, or bolt-on acquisitions, which we have a number in the pipeline down the road, so that would all those things will be opportunities to accelerate, get to double digit more quickly and then accelerate the overall returns to even higher level. Hold the fire. Yes, we'll take, Tyler, but we're planning on 100% that is correct. No, listen, we're -- this deal, right, is a very unique set of assets, right? And gives us a really attractive position, right? And we don't think there's deal of a size or scale right out there in the future, and we're certainly going to take this, should we be able to close it and integrate it, get our people connected the systems, right, make sure that we're executing above the pro forma, right. And then along the way, of course, there's other deals that can fold into this, while we're aggressively growing, right, the solid waste and recycling business. So we don't have any defined target of what percentage of the business this is. But the bulk of this business, just arithmetically is going to be our traditional recycling and solid waste business. And we're going to continue to kind of grow both sides of that as we move forward. Yes and I think Tyler the other thing we do just the $40 million is exclusively cost synergies, there are no revenue synergies baked into the plan. Yes, so Mike, let me kind of put it to you this way here. And I mentioned that we've got the additional cash incentive compensation that we're paying in \u201822. That's related to \u201821 performance. It's about $40 million of extra cash, which impacts free cash flow conversion by 100 basis points. So we think we're going to be able to from overall perspective, get to that 45% plus even absorbing that $40 million extra that extra 100 basis points of free cash flow conversion. That's cash for ops, right and working capital where you see it. Well, remember we talked about in the current year, right? So again, if you take a look at our original guide, and then what we ultimately spent at the midpoint of that we were kind of $90 million more of CapEx. So we had the ability one to fund additional growth. So again, let's take a look at our volume performance. So from an organic perspective, we had additional growth opportunities, as well as pulled forward some capital that was originally going to be spent in \u201822. So that's why it's relatively flat in \u201822, is because some of that spending actually happened in \u201821. Well, I probably have to do a little math offline, Michael to confirm or deny your thesis. But I think broadly speaking, you're in the right zone, which is people get very caught up in the margin. And listen, we understand the margin as a way to measure the business. And we don't run away from that, we own that. And we've done a great job of expanding margins the last couple years, right, kind of creeping up on 300 basis points as we get into next year, right. But we don't run the business for the core, we don't run it for any single metric, we run it for the long term and intrinsic value. So that's where cash on cash returns. And that's where value creation comes in. And so business that might have a slightly different optics, which is structurally a little less, lower margin. And then but less capital intensity, that free cash flow conversion is a better metric that serves to harmonize those two things, and get much closer to returns or a view toward returns. And, look, we think there's margin opportunity in this business, right? We think that we're going to continue to look for efficiencies, and we're going to think about make sure that we take our mindset around revenue management and our skills and capabilities and our belief that we have to price out of our cost, right and be expanding margins that allows us to reinvest in the business, right and take care of our customers over time. Yes, I talked about the $40 million that we have right in front of us. And then of course, as we go, and we'll look for opportunities, now, we're acquiring not just assets we are acquiring deep expertise, right in the hazardous waste value chain, and around compliance and operations and commercial capabilities. And so we're very, very mindful of that. And the last thing I want to do is step over a $20 bill to grab a nickel. So we're not going to be very short term focus, we're going to think about long term. And as we find more and learn more, right, we'll certainly report out on that. On the revenue side, but we haven't put anything into the pro forma, right, we see opportunities across multiple fronts. And strategically, the reason that we're into this business is because of the connectivity of solid waste, and recycling customers that have asked us to go here, they want a one stop shop, they want somebody who we now think we will have the leading set of products and services in the environmental services space to serve our customers. So the cross-sell opportunities become immediate, and we've seen that with ACV and any other previous acquisition that we've done in this space. We talked about the following acquisitions and that being a real opportunity. We think there are really interesting capital investment opportunities on the post collection side of that business that allow us to compete more broadly right across incineration some other parts of the value chain we're excited about. And then plus we will bring our skill and capability of revenue management to the table understanding that there is no work for free. So we'll look at every individual job that we do and make sure there's sufficient returns on that over time again, that becomes important to allow us to pay our people and to reinvest in the business. And we haven't quantified any of those yet, right, because we're thinking concentrate, and hopefully closing this transaction and integrating our colleagues. But we think there's a lot of upside over time. Well, I think the great news is that we're not capital constrained, right? So that we don't to have $1 and choose where to put it. We look strategically, where's the fit? And does it meet our discipline returns criteria. And then if it's both we invest in both over time, I think this space looks very similar to what's always in recycling look like a decade or more ago where there's a lot of fragmentation. And we've already seen this rolling in smaller players, right provides a ton of synergy. And we've got a pipeline that we see some sometimes building on a regional footprint, sometimes it's adding even further adding your product and service offering that will be great fits. And our pipeline and acquisitions is robust on both fronts. Yes, so Sean, remember one of the things you have to remember when we disclose average yield, we're using total revenue as the denominators, when you take a look about where we price and you look in that solid waste business, if you did an unrelated business, it would actually be 70 basis points higher than our 2021 performance and about 20 to 30 basis points higher than on total revenues. So that's the way you have to put it into context. So the 3.4%, you got to make 3.6% or 3.7% call it based on related revenues. And you look at that pricing in excess of cost inflation that would imply closer to a 3%, inflation, cost inflation. Kind of wage and benefit number, there's probably slightly higher, keep in mind, we're not talking a lot about it, but we're still getting a lot of productivity benefits to RISE. And that's one of the great stories through the pandemic is it's allowed us to pay keep paying our people as their bills go up, while managing the cost structure because we're just getting more efficient at the work. Yes, look, I think there's been some elevated capital with respect to building out right, some landfill. So through the cycle, we would expect the capex to run circa 9% of revenue or so on that business. And again, it's going to be less than that in that 4% to 5% range on the field services piece and a little bit more on that Waste Solutions piece. But on average call about 9%. Yes. So I think versus your previous thesis, I think, when you start with this sounds like an interesting bundle, let me try to go sell it right, that may or may not work, right, we start with asking the customer, what they want, what they need, and how they want to buy, and have worked our way back into this. So it's true, certainly for our broad set of industrial customers, right, who produce an ongoing recurring set of waste streams. And this really has accelerated over the last decade, they want fewer people into their plants. And second, they're like taking a very hard look at the sustainability footprint of their supply base, right, that's a big part of their sustainability story. And so people who have the ratings we have who have the record, we have become really meaningful for them. And keep in mind, we're still a very, very small percentage of their overall cost structure. So the idea that they'd be willing to pay a little bit more for somebody who can handle their needs compliantly and provide the speed they need, right? That's the value proposition. And that's what we've seen proven out with the ACB transaction immediately, right. And we think we'll get that to just at a much bigger scale with a US Ecology transaction. It also applies to some event type work. I think about the infrastructure bill and brownfield sites remediation, the same thing, you have a contractor there, but who's really unwatched to understand speed, and a single provider that can handle all the different waste streams becomes a really big strategic advantage. Yes, sure. So I mean, it starts with their historic bid, this was a really in the post collection, hazardous landfill site, they have TFTs intended bands and other things around that. But those five sites, right, give them about a 36% market share position, right in hazardous post collection, right? That's when the strength of their business really, really strong. And we're excited about that. They bought a company called NRC, which has largely field services, which the thesis of which is getting close to the customer, we believe and agree with that thesis, right. And we've seen that and prove that out that that works. Right. We were there with the ACD deal. And we see that in our Gulf Coast region as well over time, that NRC transaction brought with it a couple of other types of businesses, they've got a little bit business in Europe, and they've got some things, marine standby business focuses on oil spill recovery, right? Those are things that we'll go in and quickly take a look at and evaluate and understand, hey, what is the -- what's the fit with the rest of the business? Is it connected from a customer standpoint, from an asset sharing standpoint, I take a very fair view of this something we think we can build and grow will be excited about it. Or if this is something that might be a little more standalone and not very scalable, and somebody else might be the more natural owner of that will of course evaluate that as well. Yes, I know the thesis and it's true in some industries, where hey, the more you put together, the more you bundle, the more price pressure you could be under. And we see this in our business today, actually, that the more products a customer and services a customer buy the average price per product or service goes up, not down, right. And keep in mind waste and recycling broadly, are a very, very, very small portion of a customer's cost structure. If you run a manufacturing facility, you think first about all of your direct costs could be steel, or copper, anything else, and then you think about your labor, and then you think about your SGA costs of IT and everything else. Waste and Recycling, right? We're talking about basis points, right on someone's overall cost structure. So a small price premium on a very small number is still a very, very small number. So for them, it's around compliance, right? Think about producer liability, right? When they produce a waste stream, especially more complex and complicated ones, they have the liability of that forever. So having somebody who's going to handle that in a sustainable and appropriate manner is of enormous value to them, the speed right of being able to get things out of their facility, and keep the container empty, because a full container can sometimes shut down the manufacturing process. So there's enormous value created by speed, ease of service, right, digital interface, and billing. And those are all pieces that we start to put together for people. So that's the value proposition for customers. Well, we look at that all the time, right, we understand and we're very sophisticated pricing, both pricing new customers, as well as pricing existing customers. And the latter becomes more important for us, obviously, because we have such a long customer tenure, right? That's what that high customer retention drives are underneath that is long customer tenure. And so we have all kinds of experiences with customers around test and learn, right, we take A and B sampling, in terms of understanding a price that customers are willing to pay, and then at what price does that start to drive churn, right and start to drive defection. And there's an incredible amount of science underneath that process that's been developed over the last two decades. So it's really not the top down number we look at. And if we go 92, we change pricing across the board or the opposite direction, right? It's much more surgical almost at a customer by customer level, right. And that's what produces the pricing number while driving great volume growth. Yes, sure. So on plastics, listen, the world has a single use plastics problem, right? And you don't have to read too many websites or magazines or watching the television shows to figure that out. Now, it's very different nature of those firms are very different across geography. But in the US, the problem is right circularity right, we produce single use water bottles or anything else. And we don't capture enough of those. And that plastic ultimately gets lost or gets downgraded, right. And there's huge pressure on the CPG companies to drive more reusable product.

But we think where we've got an opportunity to take a next step, and move forward with some pretty simple processing, that is going to allow us to capture a higher selling price, and take more volatility right out of those sales through longer term contracting. I'm not going to get any more detail right now than that. But stay tuned here, because I think in the next few months, you're going to hear far more color on that topic And then on Us Ecology, listen, we have a really robust and capable business development team, both out and geographically dispersed, as well as here in Phoenix that maintains a perspective on every company big and small, and builds a pipeline.

But we have our own robust pipeline, right that we know will fit in well, right to the US Ecology platform, right post closing. At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll now turn back over to you for closing remarks. Thank you, Sara. In closing the strength of our 2021 performance demonstrates the power of our platform, and the value our strategic investments are creating. We exceeded our upwardly revised financial goals by delivering double digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. We continue to manage the business well to create long-term value for all stakeholders and expect continued profitable growth in 2022. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our customers. Results like these are made possible by our team of dedicated employees.

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price during the fourth quarter was 5.4%, which included open market pricing of 7% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.6%, large container of 5.6% and residential of 4.8%. Average yield was 3.4%, which represents a 20 basis point increase from our third quarter performance. In 2022, we expect average yield of approximately 3.4%. This is an increase of 50 basis points over our full year 2021 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 3.6%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 4.6% and increase in large container of 3.7% and an increase in landfill of 6.7%. We expect organic volume growth in a range of 1.5% to 2% in 2022, which remains well above our long-term average. Moving on recycling. Commodity prices were $218 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compares to $110 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 110 basis points to internal growth during the fourth quarter. We are assuming $187 per ton for recycled commodities in 2022, which is consistent with the full year 2021 average. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $65 million from the prior year. This was driven by organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same store basis Environmental Solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 28.1%. This compared to 29.9% in the prior years, margin performance during the quarter was impacted by a 70 basis point headwind from higher incentive compensation expense, and we expect incentive compensation expense will return to target levels. Margin performance also included a 50 basis point dilutive impact from recent acquisitions, which included deal and transition costs. It should be noted that we pulled forward certain integration costs originally planned for 2022. The remaining impact of margin was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in risk management costs. The current period includes a one-time true up for an insurance captive net increased expense 20 basis points in the prior year included a 30 basis point favorable reduction in reserves which did not repeat. We expect risk management expense in 2022 to be relatively flat with our full year 2021 performance. For reference purposes, fourth quarter margin performance at target levels of incentive compensation and excluding the one-time Committed to Serve payment would have been 29.4%. The remaining difference to prior your margin performance relates to the impact of recent acquisitions. SG&A during the fourth quarter was 10.6% of revenue. This represents an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, which was driven by higher incentive compensation approvals previously discussed. Full year 2021 EBITDA margin up 30% expanded 60 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from pricing levels in excess of cost inflation and effective cost management, which demonstrates our ability to gain operating leverage in the business. To put our operating leverage in the context, we estimate wage inflation net of productivity was approximately 3%. Our average yield of 3.4% more than covers this level of cost inflation, which is why labor and maintenance were both down as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter and for the year. In 2022, we expect EBITDA margin will continue to improve and our targeting margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points over our full year 2021 performance. The components of expected margin expansion include pricing in excess of cost inflation, adding 60 to 70 basis points, and incentive compensation expense returning to target levels, adding 50 basis points, partially offset by acquisitions decreasing margin by 40 basis points and net fuel decreasing margin by 40 basis points. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.2% for the year. We expect DD&A as a percentage of revenue of approximately 11.5% in 2022. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.52 billion and increased $279 million or 23% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and a reduction in interest expense resulting from refinancing debt. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion increased 350 basis points to 44.8%. We are targeting high 40% level conversion within the next couple of years. Total debt was $9.6 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio was 2.9x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and noncash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 24% during the fourth quarter. This was in line with our expectations and resulted in a 26% equivalent tax impact for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2022, made up of an effective tax rate of 21% and approximately $120 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Let me now turn it back over to Jon. Yes. Largely because that's baked into the plan, right, we've got elevated increases for all of our frontline people given it's an inflationary environment. And again, we're pricing ahead of that. And even with that plan, we're planning to expand margins. So that's why we assume that, again, as the situation moves and becomes dynamic, we'll adjust accordingly. That's correct. Yes, Tyler, absolutely in the solid waste and recycling side, right? We're on our marks, right? And we're going to get there. And you're right, this acquisition right in this space in general has a slightly different value creation formula a little bit lower margins, but less capital intensity, right. And so that starts to converge more into free cash flow conversion, you'll see us move later in the year to segment reporting, right, that calls those things out and really makes it clear to the investment community, what kind of progress we're making on each front. And so just arithmetically right, we'll get there just slightly slower than we would have otherwise. But our sights are still set toward that target overtime. No, it's too broad fronts, think about half of it as a duplicative corporate costs, right? This is costs of being a public company, IR treasury and all the normal things that you would think to take out and then the other $20 million would come more at the field level because you see, we have a Gulf Coast region, right? We have a Northeast Region and environmental solutions business, right. They have a national footprint. And we'll obviously think about harmonizing and integrating those. Right, that's a relatively small number, right? When you think about it in terms of cost takeout, because we think this is a huge platform for growth for us, right? We're not going into cut and flip or buying to keep and build. Now, as we go and we learn more, if there's more opportunities to do things a bit more efficiently, we'll certainly take advantage of that."

I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times, and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities of customer zeal, digital and sustainability to drive growth and value for our stakeholders. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of approximately 14% compared to the prior year, generated adjusting earnings per share of $1.11, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year, and produced $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've invested over $900 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. On August 31, we completed the acquisition of ACV Enviro. This strategic acquisition broadens our capabilities and offerings in the environmental services industry. It also provides us with a platform to pursue additional growth. We are excited to welcome ACB to the Republic team. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in both recycling solid waste and the environmental solutions businesses. We now expect to invest over $1 billion in acquisitions for the full year. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we have returned $622 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to prioritize customer zeal to drive profitable growth. This includes increasing customer loyalty, driving willingness to pay and attracting new volume as the provider of choice. Our customer retention rate remains at a record setting level of 95%. During the third quarter, we delivered outsized revenue growth throughout our business. Total core price remained at an all-time high of 5.2%, and average yield increased to 3.2%. Volume increased 4.3% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations and acquisitions contributed an incremental 350 basis points to total revenue growth. The outlook for organic and acquisition growth for the remainder of the year is strong. Turning to digital, we continue to realize the benefits of our investments in technology. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. We have now implemented tablets and approximately 70% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year, with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2020. Next, turning to our sustainability platform. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We currently have 17 projects in the pipeline with more opportunities thereafter. On top of the royalty revenue these plants will generate a majority of equity investment opportunities to further participate in the project economics. We also recently opened a solar project on one of our closed landfills in Bellevue, Illinois. This project consists of 30,000 solar panels, and will produce enough energy to power 2200 homes annually. We remain committed to increasing the recycling and circularity of key materials as part of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goals. We recently opened the first solar power compost facility in California to further our progress and address the growing community needs. This facility will provide critical organic processing capabilities to residents and businesses in the greater San Diego area. Our strong financial and operational results would not have been possible without our dedicated Republican employees. We continue to invest in developing both existing and new talent and creating innovative solutions for the increased demand for skilled workers. We recently unveiled our Republic Services Technical Institute, which is the industry's first ever diesel technician school. This subsidized program is already building a strong pipeline of high demand technician talent for Republic. Additionally, graduates will have up skilling opportunities to further grow their career with Republic. These types of innovative investments and talent lead to external recognition for our company. Republic was recently certified as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. This is a meaningful achievement, as employee recruiting and retention remains a prominent focus in today's labor market. Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given the continued strength in our business, we now expect to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. Accordingly, we're increasing 2021 full year financial guidance as follows. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of 410 to 413. And adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Core price during the third quarter was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.2%, large container a 5%, and residential of 5%. Average yield was 3.2%, which increased 60 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter volume increased 4.3%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 5.4%, an increase in large container of 3.9% and an increase in landfill of 6.6%. For reference, small container and MSW volumes in the third quarter were both above a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Moving on to recycling, commodity prices increased to $230 per ton in the third quarter. This compares to $99 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 160 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Third quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $27 million from the prior year. This was driven by both organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same store basis environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 30.4% and increased 10 basis points over the prior year. This included a 90 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 50 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 30 basis point headwind from the impact of recent acquisitions, primarily driven by deal and integration costs. SG&A was 10.2% of revenue. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year, which was exclusively due to higher incentive compensation accruals. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion and increased $247 million or 22% compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by EBITDA growth in the business. With respect to our full year cash flow guidance, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. It should also be noted that we increased our expected full year capital spending in our upwardly revised guidance by over $50 million. This increase relates to capital to support growth opportunities. Free cash flow conversion through September continue to track ahead of our original expectations and increase 330 basis points over the prior year. During the quarter total debt was $9.3 billion and total liquidity was $2.4 billion. Interest expense decreased $11 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.8 times. With respect to taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 27% when you include non-cash charges from solar investments. We expect our fourth quarter equivalent tax impact to be approximately 25%. This includes the effective tax rate and non-cash solar charges. I will now turn the call back over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Brian. We continue to create value for our stakeholders by executing our strategic priorities, which drives profitable growth and increases returns. We are expecting the positive momentum in our business to continue to produce profitable growth in 2022. At this point, we anticipate producing above average revenue growth, leading to high single digit adjusted free cash flow growth compared to our full year 2021 performance. As usual, we'll provide full year detailed 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that operator, I would like to open the call to question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nJon Vander Ark: Good afternoon Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Brian, thanks for the detail on the 10 basis point improvement. But one, kind of how should we think about margins in Q4? Will they likely hold sequentially? And the number two, and I know you'll give more details on this, but big picture, you've got a strong CPI rollover, you got a rational open market, do you expect in '22 to make progress on that 32% margin goal?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, Tyler, let me kind of answer the first part of your question there. I think you embedded two or three questions in there. So at least with respect to sequentially, there's a normal step down sequentially from Q3 into Q4, as well as we talked about the fact that we're doing more deals than originally anticipated. So we expect the highest level of deal and transaction and integration costs in the fourth quarter. So again, while we expect to see in the underlying business, we're expecting to continue to see really strong performance, we do expect a sequential step down Q3 to Q4.\nJon Vander Ark: And then on your second part of your question, Tyler, yes, outlook is strong for next year, certainly, we've been strong on pricing in the open market portion of our business already. And we'll continue to do that. And then as some of these escalators kick in the lag effect of 12 to 18 months, so some of them kick in into 2022, that provides more upward pressure on pricing, which we think will lead to margin expansion in 2022.\nTyler Brown: Okay, and then just from a modelling perspective, how much revenue today would likely roll over next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: If you just take a look at the deals that have been completed through September, it's 160 basis points.\nTyler Brown: Okay. And then my last one here, so Jon, it's interesting. If you look at the big three, I think you guys posted actually the best volume growth this quarter and you actually had the toughest comp. So I'm not asking you to necessarily compare and contrast you with the peers. But was there a line or a vertical that just gave you this outside strength that you saw? I'm just kind of trying to - it's not really your strategy to priorities volume over price, I just want to make sure that that's - make sure I've got that all straight?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, you certainly have the last parts, right, which is we're always going to start with price over volume, right. I mean, the thesis broadly of our company and the industry is that we can price ahead of our cost inflation. And I think we've proven to do that in a kind of rapidly changing environment this quarter. So we certainly feel good about that, in the short-term in the long-term over time. And on the volume side, listen, we certainly left some volume on the table. If we had more labor, we would have gone after some more opportunities on that front. So very strong demand environment and I think the GDP print was 2% for the quarter, a lot of that's on the consumer side. I think the industrial side of our economy is very, very strong right now. And so our volume is pretty broad based pretty strong across the board.\nTyler Brown: Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good afternoon. My first question is just on SG&A leverage going forward, maybe you could just walk through any potential COVID related costs that came out of your system that are now coming back? Maybe there's some costs that are permanent in nature pose sort of looking at the business through COVID that you've instituted, just give us a sense of how to think about that going forward?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, I'd say there's some modest puts or takes, and we're already seeing some of that, for example, small container rates are coming back and long-term, that's a good thing, because it's a positive sign for demand. But that's certainly a financial headwind for us in a very short-term period that we already saw some of and we think that modulates over time. Certainly some - with a Delta variant, we had some elevated PTO cost, right in the quarter of people who were sitting out and still getting paid overtime. So that's the headwind that abates over time. Listen, there's traffic patterns come back, does that slow us down a little bit, maybe I would have guessed, we would have seen a lot of that. But our RISE platform is really delivering a lot of productivity into the business. And then more from a central function standpoint we'll shrink our real estate footprint incrementally here as we have some of our more transactional colleagues working from home permanently, but that's pretty modest broad strokes. Again a little bit of travel will come back, but we'll also take advantage of teams and do things in different ways over time. So again, lots of individual puts and takes, but I don't see - certainly I don't see any big structural headwinds that are going to come after us.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah and Hamzah to your question specifically on SG&A, we've had a number of those costs come back into the system as far as some of the travel related costs. So we're seeing that in the current period. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks most of the increase we saw really had to do with incentive compensation really didn't have to do with any of those ongoing SG&A expenses. So we feel pretty good about our performance and our ability to leverage, right, SGA going forward as we continue to grow the top line and migrate towards that 10% of revenue.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it, very helpful. And just my follow up question. You mentioned landfill to gas, you mentioned 17 projects in the pipeline. Historically, I think you've just outsourced and taken royalty revenue. I think you referenced that you have equity stake opportunities. Is that something you've done before? And why not just bring them in house given some of the ROIC and strong sort of margin profile of some of that - some of those projects? Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, that's a great question. So historically, again, we've been more opportunistic and side by side in this. As the world is moving into a more sustainable operation, we're certainly doing our part and hopefully leading the way. This has become more critical for us going forward. So not only do we have 17 project, and we got another slate behind that that we're evaluating. And we'll participate in a different way than we have historically, probably in an equity basis, but probably not full ownership. And why I say this, we have a limited number of landfills. And so this is a great growth opportunity for us to pursue, but there's a ceiling to it, once you've kind of built it out on all the landfills, that makes sense. That's it. We like to put all of our financial capital and our human capital in places that we think grow in an evergreen way. And so that's where we'll put our attention. Combine that with the fact that there's a lot of external financial and human capital resources, who are anxious to partner with us. And we think that's probably going to be the winning combination for us going forward.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. And the other thing too, Hamzah, is that partnering up with a third party, we can actually move faster than if we were to sit there and go our own way. And that's one of the reasons we want to move quickly on this opportunity.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. I just had a clarification question. Historically I think at Q3, you've talked about preliminary 2022 sort of maybe top line, is that a change in sort of how you're thinking about guidance? Or maybe historically you haven't done that?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. No Hamzah, I think we talked in our remarks as well, but we talked about here was providing visibility into where we see free cash flow going at this point. But that said, I think you also hear the tone. We're optimistic about the momentum in pricing. Volume is strong. And there's additional opportunities. And again, when you look at just the acquisition, rollover, as well as the pipeline of acquisitions that are there, we feel that 2022 is going to be very strong on that front as well. So contribution from multiple facets that at least relative to a historical growth weight rate, we feel it's going to be outsized.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley.\nJeff Goldstein: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions here. So labor expense has clearly been a key topic in the quarter. But within your COGS, labor, I noticed actually declined as a percent of revenue year-over-year. So maybe you can just talk about how you've managed to contain that? Is it primarily from raising price? Is there anything around scheduling or maybe doing proactive wage increases that you call out? Maybe just talk a little bit more about the success managing that in the quarter? And then I guess going forward, is there any reason to think you won't be able to manage it as well?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, thanks for your question. I think you have to look way back to low CPI environments. And we've always had this fundamental belief that we want to give our people a fair and certainly steady increase every year. So we were raising their wages that 2% or 2.5%, even in low CPI environments, so people have been focusing in parallel on employee engagement and making sure this is the place that the best people come to work. So you put those two things together, and we think our employee value proposition has been really strong. And while turnover has been elevated, it's been modestly elevated. And we've really - we would have taken more people if we could to pursue some incremental growth opportunities, but our attention has been really strong. Now, that being said, we're facing the same pressures of the macro environment. So we've looked and done surgery and targeted markets where we think we weren't as competitive or maybe turnover was elevated. But you kind of take those costs increases, and you offset it with what we think is our digital ops in our RISE platform, which is really driving productivity, we look at our performance. And in the quarter versus 2019, right, we're just seeing we're getting more work right out of the same labor hour. And that's been really productive. And I think you're seeing it hold in a very challenging environment. And then, on top of that, of course, we're pricing because the market bears it and we're want to support future wage increases for our employees.\nJeff Goldstein: Okay, that that all made sense. And then now that you've had Santek for a few months, I think it closed back in May. I'm curious for the path forward, I'm bringing those margins back up to Republic levels, and any sense of synergies you'd expect out of that business. And then remind me in terms of pricing within the Santek book, was that in a place you were happy with? Or is there room to re-price some of that business as well. Just an update there would be helpful.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, we're really excited about that acquisition, great set of assets, gets us into certainly some geographic markets that we weren't in before. And that creates a basis or a platform for further growth, both organic and additional tuck-in acquisitions. As Brian mentioned, there's always startup costs in the first year. And the bigger the deal, the more the startup costs, because we really don't have to get multiple sites in the systems integrated. And there's a lot of employee benefits and related costs. And we really try to front load all those and get all those done at once. A, to get those behind us, but B, to create a great employee experience. And so if those linger forever, they feel like they're not really part of the company. We think that leads to higher turnover time. So we'd get after that and have a very proactive and intentional plan. And we're ahead of that plan. And I think you'll see in '22, that'll be a nice, certainly tailwind for us as those costs come behind us. And given the nature of that company, the fairly landfill centric, the margins are really attractive.\nJeff Goldstein: Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah, thanks very much operator and thanks for taking my questions, everyone. I'd like to turn back to acquisitions for a moment. When you look at the pipeline, which you mentioned, is quite robust right now. I was wondering if you could be able to provide a little bit of color on the pipeline perhaps discuss whether are these all smaller tuck ins? Are there any larger chunkier targets end markets that interest you? And as a follow up, is the regulatory review and scrutiny at all impacting your ability to do deals in this environment right now? Thanks very much.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. Walter the pipeline is - I mean, the performance has been very strong this year. And the pipeline looking forward is very strong. And I would say the power and characteristic of that is very, very balanced, right. It's balanced, certainly weighted more heavily toward recycling and waste just given that's where the bulk of our business is, but certainly plenty of opportunities in the environmental solutions portion of our business as well. It's certainly balanced across size, plenty of small tuck-ins. I think a number of what we'd call medium sized deals, and then listen, we maintain a perspective on everything. So could there be some larger deals that come through over time? Yeah, those are obviously more episodic, and can be - could be challenging from regulatory review. On balance, we have a very crystal clear point of view of where the regulation sits. And so if we think there's a deal that really is not going to get through, we just don't spend energy and time pursuing that opportunity. And or if we do have limited regulatory scrutiny on a deal, we've baked that right in, we understand what we probably have to divest and we go right to the regulators and say, here's our perspective. And then they can draw their own perspective. But we plan that right into the model. So we're never surprised on the back end of that. So, yes, there is heightened scrutiny versus four or five years ago on larger transactions, but more broadly, it's not slowed us down at all from I think, what is a different level of acquisition than we've historically done.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. And here's my follow up on special waste, it looks like it was a good quarter for you on special waste. Had some nice tailwind there, but it can be lumpy business. How do you look at contribution from special waste from quarter-to-quarter? And is there any flags that you would give us in terms of how we model it in quarter to next? Are you fairly confident that that's going to be a good tailwind for you here over the next several quarters?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, I think it's a good tailwind, again, we saw kind of - we were acted as ever. We saw times of uncertainty. I think if you go back 20, 25 years, special waste typically pushes right, jobs get sold and they get confirmed, but they just don't drop and get delivered. And so I think what you're seeing now is those things are starting to move. And so feel good about that. The pipeline is very robust going forward. It's a project based business. So by definition, right, there's going to be quarters that are a little higher versus others. But I think the outlook for the next 12 to 18 months is very, very strong.\nWalter Spracklin: That's fantastic. Appreciate the time as always. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. The challenge, when you have two is can you actually ask a question with 14 different questions in it?\nJon Vander Ark: You're quite good at that, Michael, I trust you.\nMichael Hoffman: My attempt to do that is on organic growth. Thinking about a baseline exit momentum going into '22. You parse price and volume would - are we in the right neighborhood as we're starting with a three handle on twice and then volume, ex special waste lumpiness, still has momentum from new business formation, service interval trends being positive, but we haven't seen a peak in that activity, so that creates tailwind. That's the right way to think about going into '22.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. Certainly on the pricing, we would expect something starting with a three and then on volume look, we're coming out of a - we're in a V shaped recovery. And obviously, as the further along, you get this arithmetically, right, that slope starts to flatten. But I think there's still plenty of momentum, I talked about the labor side of being a little constrained there versus a pre pandemic year, you're going to see outsized volume growth in 2022 to for months.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. And the follow up to that, though, is probably not as high, though, as what we're going to see in '21. It's somewhere in between.\nMichael Hoffman: I couldn't hear you're Brian, could you say that again?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: No, I just said to Jon's point, most of '21 was a recovery of units that were lost during the pandemic. My only point was that the volume at least the way we're thinking about it right now, would be somewhere in between what we're doing in '21, or what we're going to deliver and '21 and that hit historical average.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it. And then last one for me is on free cash flow. And you think about a baseline of a conversion ratio. And you've talked about getting into the mid-40s. It appears that you're going to be there this year. So is that now the new - you've got to it and in that context going forward, you're spending more CapEx this year, but did you pull any forward? Or should I think of CapEx is the same rate of spend percent of revs and '22?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, I think that CapEx is really more a function of growth, incremental CapEx, and these acquisitions with you, oftentimes, there's a plan and there's development projects associated with those, which are great. Those are more one time in nature, right, and then you get the benefit the returns of those in future years. And from a free cash flow conversion standpoint. Yes, right. We think we've hit a new baseline and we have plans to further expand that going into 2022 and beyond.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, so how did I do? Did I get enough question in the two?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: That was excellent.\nMichael Hoffman: Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Can you talk about what pricing announcements you've made to your open market customers in October? And as you folks look at the inflation that everyone across the industry is seeing, how much you feel like you need to push open market pricing over the next couple of months to make sure we've got enough room to execute as we hit the meaty part of the inflation cycle.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, I would say you got to look back, right, we've already done that. We jumped on that pretty much in the mid to end part of the first quarter, understanding where inflation was going and you're seeing our open market not 100 BPS of incremental pricing versus the prior quarters, right because we're pricing not only existing customers, but also new customers, right. Our capture pricing tool, as we saw steel go up for example, on containers, right, we put that right in and so immediately we're selling at different price on the street, right to cover the cost of that incremental steel, right with a return against it. So we're not diluting returns as we price that through so listen, we're putting more price out. That price is being realized in the marketplace. And again, we have a good broad backdrop right when you things like bacon is doubling and all kinds of things are going crazy, rental cars and from just a consumer purchasing standpoint where prices are going or as these price increases are relatively modest against that backdrop, and I think that's a good reason why they're holding. Yeah.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. And Jerry just a follow up there, again, we've been quick to act in the open market. You really haven't seen the contribution yet from the restricted portion of the business. That's still to come in '22 with a rollover benefit in the '23.\nJerry Revich: And just to clarify, so the current level of core price increases for over market 6.5. And obviously, we'll see the restricted acceleration from here, but it is the 6.5 now at a high enough pace to cover this heightened level of inflation? Or should we look for open market increases to be higher than the six and a half we're posting now.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah you could see it incrementally tick up. But we're also managing costs in a way, right, where we're taking the price and the cost inflation expanding margins, right. As we go, not only looking back, right, we're almost a 200 basis point expansion. If you look back a couple years, and we think we've got more room to run in that going forward. Keep in mind, we've price to existing customers, it's not a onetime event, right. We price rapidly kind of an open market, roughly a 12th of the book goes out every month, right. It's our ability to be flex up on that is really, really high.\nJerry Revich: Okay, great. And then you alluded to recycling investment opportunities in the press release. Could you just expand on that? What's the range of opportunities in terms of building facilities organically or seeing recycling rate increases out of your existing footprint versus acquisitions, can I trouble you just to flesh out that opportunities there please?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, we think there's a five or six core markets we're in that we would like to have an asset that was one over time we'll probably build if we could buy it, that would also be an opportunity, but probably something we'll build. Certainly seeing acquisition opportunities, smaller ones for recycling centers as we do some more medium sized deals going forward and apart because we want to make sure we've got a place to take the material off of our back and not always be dependent on a third party in those markets. And apart because we think these resources have increasing value over time, right. In a world where plastics, for example, the consumer packages, companies are really in a need for post-consumer content. And we haven't, and we're an aggregator. So over time, that material is more valued, we think we're going to be able to capture a piece of that as we move forward. And the other thing I'll add Jerry there's plenty of opportunities on our existing facilities, to drive in more automation to kind of change the CapEx and OpEx trade off. Those are tough jobs. Those are higher turnover jobs. And so it allows us to reduce the labor force just incrementally in those facilities, but then also produce a better product with more state of the art equipment.\nJerry Revich: I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jerry.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Good afternoon. Thank you. First off, can you give us some early thoughts on CapEx for 2022? I don't know if you expect that to drop back into 11% to 12% of revenues range. And if you're willing to share with us a couple of your spending priorities for next year.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, David look, we'll get into details when we're back together in February on the components within the free cash flow, but I would sit there and say, as you think about over time, right, as Jon mentioned, we've made really good progress on free cash flow conversion. We expect to continue to make progress and start to drive that free cash flow conversion into the high 40% range, some of that is going to be by reducing our CapEx as a percent of revenue.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, second, how do you think about your commodity basket as you move into next year? I mean, do you budget for flat or do you assume it's going to be lower than that? Just how do you think about the commodity basket broadly as you look to the out year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, just right now, right, what we're kind of looking at is more of in line with a year-to-date average as compared to current pricing. But again, once this plays down, we have a couple more months on our belt, we'll be able to give you a better perspective when we're back together in February.\nDavid Manthey: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team nice quarter. A couple of modelling ones for me. Brian, I think you mentioned 160 basis points of acquisition roll over. Is that a net number or a gross number? And then secondly, I guess it's safe to assume that you guys are going to do something better than that, because you're indicating that next year is going to be an elevated level of deal activity as well. Is that correct?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, so the 160 is essentially, both gross and net, quite honestly. But yes, if you think about - that only includes deals that have been closed through September.\nSean Eastman: Okay, got it. And, okay, so we'll have more upside there by the end of the year, and then whatever you guys do next year, we'll layer on to that. Alright, got it, and then just drilling in on margins. I don't want to put you guys into a box before you're given the guidance, but maybe just thinking about the normative 30 to 50 basis points of operating leverage in the business just naturally. I mean, what would be the moving pieces to think about relative to that? I mean maybe recycled commodities are a tailwind in the first half. I'm not sure. Maybe the acquisitions you've done are modestly diluted into next year. Now, just trying to think through those moving pieces that would be helpful.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, I mean, the core of the business, right, you should think of margin expansion or pricing ahead of our cost inflation, which we're certainly very committed to doing. And then there's some other pieces on that right commodity prices, right could create a drag, depending on whether that basket goes, but fuel was a drag in the quarter, right. You know that, in general, we price fuel and our fuel recovery fee is a pretty good broad hedge to fuel. But we have a little bit of drag as we go up, and then it happens a little bit of lag as we go back down. So depending on where fuel goes, but I'd say there's probably more chance that neutral or tailwind added in the next year. And then acquisitions, right, like I said, right, we kind of load up all those integration costs in the first year. And so we expect that to be a little bit of a headwind to the overall margin for a portion of that - the headwind in the equation, in the next year, but nothing dramatic, right. We're still committed to expanding margins next year with all those pieces put together.\nSean Eastman: Okay, excellent. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. I think your footprints just to align naturally, with some population and demographic trends. And so that may partly playing years, the great organic growth trends we've seen from there. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about new business formation and new business origination for the company. And specifically Jon, how you might be leveraging your digital platform to help drive that new business formation, rather than new business origination for the company? Is there anything that you're doing differently now at Republic than you might have done in years past to help identify and build new business?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, we've certainly advanced the cause with our digital tools, I mean, our sales team is on the sales force platform and got a lot of lead generation tools across the different verticals in our business that populate new leads going forward. And we've certainly seen some of that, frankly, I think there's more of that to come, right, as we get through delta. And consumer confidence even gets higher here. And we quote, unquote, get back to travelling and back to business. So we're optimistic, there's more upside of that going forward. But we think we're getting certainly our fair share of the growth of more because we've got 1000 plus sellers out there working very local market to find opportunities, one at a time.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, and then, I guess, in the context of the ACV Enviro acquisition, I wondered if you're able to share your vision for what kind of scale you want to have in this segment over time and often you've talked about environmental services TAM being around 20 billion and the fact that the customer base wants to consolidate? Who uses for services given sustainability and other drivers, but do you want this to be a billion dollar business with a few years? Is that out of range of what you're thinking? Can you talk a little bit about your ambition?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. No, I think that's actually a really good starting point. I think a billion dollars in three ish years, I think is a reasonable target. We certainly will not race or reach to get there by any means. We certainly wouldn't be afraid to clear that if we think we have the right opportunities going forward. It will be a mix of organic growth and acquisitive growth more acquisitive than organic just in time percentage basis as we scale that business. And listen, that's been a really good fit for us in the early days, not only have they performed well, but we expected to see a lot of integration opportunities with our waste recycling business. And we're seeing a lot of those come through opportunity, internalize disposal, cross sell with customers, and it's just going to strengthen the value proposition of both sides of our business.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, thanks so much.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Noah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to special waste volumes as well as C&D. Just curious have you guys seen any impact on these volumes from the tight labor market and kind of the stressed supply chain across the business and the environment?\nJon Vander Ark: No, not really. I mean, listen, the supply chain is impacting us in weird ways. Like where we have a solar project we're putting in and we can't get them the equipment is trapped on a boat outside of Long Beach. So that project might not go in this year. But those are more incremental one off things and get we're blessed to be in a business that is a service based business, right and not materials based, or we will be probably suffering, like some of the other companies that are, so we feel good about that, but not in a special waste or C&D side. We think there's more demand coming back in that business without question, but I don't think the supply chain disruptions at attach anything to that part of the business right now.\nKyle White: Got it. And then on the solar investments, I think initially you're targeting 125 million for this year, is that still the right target? And should we expect that target to go higher next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: It might be modestly more than that. As Jon mentioned we've got some of these projects right now, it's all based on what gets placed in service by the end of the year. I would say a good number to use through the cycle is in that 150 to 175 range. And that's all - yeah, predicated on some of the tax laws that are in place today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Stinger with Bank of America.\nMichael Stinger: Hey, guys, yeah, thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the outlook raised. But just to put a finer point on it, I might have missed it. Is EBITDA margins up year-over-year on the fourth quarter? Or is there just a lot of integration acquisition costs that kind of creates some noise on the quarter?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. I think it's a couple of things. It's yes, what you said on kind of the integration costs, but also, when you take a look year-over-year, we've consistently seen since the fourth quarter of last year, heavier container weights, that sort of thing. So that that probably will put a drag on the performance relative to the prior year.\nMichael Stinger: Okay, got it. And just to be clear, I'd like - Brian, just on the 32% margin target you guys might have already fleshed out is this - is the track 2024, is that how to think about it, can it be much earlier, or in some inflationary pressure and just a lot of this acquisition? Obviously, it's lower than you integrate, I get it moving higher, like how do we think about the margin in the context of that 32% target?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, it was it, I think it's - we're not going to put a specific year on it. But we are certainly trending in that direction. And I think you're going to see steady ratable improvement, right. I don't think you're going to see any big jump, or I don't think you're going to see us flatten. And it's going to be a consistent set of levers, which is we are going to continue to grow. We're going to price out of our cost inflation and give our people a fair wage increase to drive productivity right alongside that, and listen we're growing in a different way than we ever had before. Over time, we think that gives us leverage on SG&A, which further helps with the margin expansion.\nMichael Stinger: I guess like last, if we could squeeze it in, when I think about these acquisitions for solid waste and environmental services, can you help us - Jon is like the environmental services is this lower than average margin when we think of some of this stuff outside of the oil and gas more the downstream is that lower margin, you guys can bring it up over time to kind of thinking about that portion of the business that you guys are growing relative to like the non-hazardous solid waste.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, so we start with everything on intrinsic value and returns, right. That's where we start from a fundamental standpoint. And any deal we do is going to have to clear that hurdle right individually and then naturally collectively it will over time as a platform. These businesses in general do have a lower margin profile than recycling and solid waste, they also have a different capital intensity. So when you think about free cash flow conversion, right, it looks very similar. And we do think there's certainly an opportunity to raise those margins over time. And, again, we have been incredibly consistent over the last decade on our commitment to pricing, right. And that we won't flinch or back off of that, right as we grow in the broader volume of services space, right, we are going to be able to price because we're going to provide a differentiated service and that supports us not only giving a fair wage increase to our employees, but then expanding margins and providing great returns to our shareholders over time.\nMichael Stinger: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. So I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vander Ark for some closing comments.\nJon Vander Ark : Thank you, Isley. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered double digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value for all stakeholders and expect continued profitable growth in 2022. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our customers. It is our team of dedicated employees that make these results possible. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities of customer zeal, digital and sustainability to drive growth and value for our stakeholders. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of approximately 14% compared to the prior year, generated adjusting earnings per share of $1.11, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year, and produced $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've invested over $900 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. On August 31, we completed the acquisition of ACV Enviro. This strategic acquisition broadens our capabilities and offerings in the environmental services industry. It also provides us with a platform to pursue additional growth. We are excited to welcome ACB to the Republic team. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in both recycling solid waste and the environmental solutions businesses. We now expect to invest over $1 billion in acquisitions for the full year. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we have returned $622 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to prioritize customer zeal to drive profitable growth. This includes increasing customer loyalty, driving willingness to pay and attracting new volume as the provider of choice. Our customer retention rate remains at a record setting level of 95%. During the third quarter, we delivered outsized revenue growth throughout our business. Total core price remained at an all-time high of 5.2%, and average yield increased to 3.2%. Volume increased 4.3% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations and acquisitions contributed an incremental 350 basis points to total revenue growth. The outlook for organic and acquisition growth for the remainder of the year is strong. Turning to digital, we continue to realize the benefits of our investments in technology. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. We have now implemented tablets and approximately 70% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year, with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2020. Next, turning to our sustainability platform. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We currently have 17 projects in the pipeline with more opportunities thereafter. On top of the royalty revenue these plants will generate a majority of equity investment opportunities to further participate in the project economics. We also recently opened a solar project on one of our closed landfills in Bellevue, Illinois. This project consists of 30,000 solar panels, and will produce enough energy to power 2200 homes annually. We remain committed to increasing the recycling and circularity of key materials as part of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goals. We recently opened the first solar power compost facility in California to further our progress and address the growing community needs. This facility will provide critical organic processing capabilities to residents and businesses in the greater San Diego area. Our strong financial and operational results would not have been possible without our dedicated Republican employees. We continue to invest in developing both existing and new talent and creating innovative solutions for the increased demand for skilled workers. We recently unveiled our Republic Services Technical Institute, which is the industry's first ever diesel technician school. This subsidized program is already building a strong pipeline of high demand technician talent for Republic. Additionally, graduates will have up skilling opportunities to further grow their career with Republic. These types of innovative investments and talent lead to external recognition for our company. Republic was recently certified as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. This is a meaningful achievement, as employee recruiting and retention remains a prominent focus in today's labor market. Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given the continued strength in our business, we now expect to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. Accordingly, we're increasing 2021 full year financial guidance as follows. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of 410 to 413. And adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Brian. We continue to create value for our stakeholders by executing our strategic priorities, which drives profitable growth and increases returns. We are expecting the positive momentum in our business to continue to produce profitable growth in 2022. At this point, we anticipate producing above average revenue growth, leading to high single digit adjusted free cash flow growth compared to our full year 2021 performance. As usual, we'll provide full year detailed 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that operator, I would like to open the call to question. Good afternoon Tyler. And then on your second part of your question, Tyler, yes, outlook is strong for next year, certainly, we've been strong on pricing in the open market portion of our business already. And we'll continue to do that. And then as some of these escalators kick in the lag effect of 12 to 18 months, so some of them kick in into 2022, that provides more upward pressure on pricing, which we think will lead to margin expansion in 2022. Well, you certainly have the last parts, right, which is we're always going to start with price over volume, right. I mean, the thesis broadly of our company and the industry is that we can price ahead of our cost inflation. And I think we've proven to do that in a kind of rapidly changing environment this quarter. So we certainly feel good about that, in the short-term in the long-term over time. And on the volume side, listen, we certainly left some volume on the table. If we had more labor, we would have gone after some more opportunities on that front. So very strong demand environment and I think the GDP print was 2% for the quarter, a lot of that's on the consumer side. I think the industrial side of our economy is very, very strong right now. And so our volume is pretty broad based pretty strong across the board. Yeah, I'd say there's some modest puts or takes, and we're already seeing some of that, for example, small container rates are coming back and long-term, that's a good thing, because it's a positive sign for demand. But that's certainly a financial headwind for us in a very short-term period that we already saw some of and we think that modulates over time. Certainly some - with a Delta variant, we had some elevated PTO cost, right in the quarter of people who were sitting out and still getting paid overtime. So that's the headwind that abates over time. Listen, there's traffic patterns come back, does that slow us down a little bit, maybe I would have guessed, we would have seen a lot of that. But our RISE platform is really delivering a lot of productivity into the business. And then more from a central function standpoint we'll shrink our real estate footprint incrementally here as we have some of our more transactional colleagues working from home permanently, but that's pretty modest broad strokes. Again a little bit of travel will come back, but we'll also take advantage of teams and do things in different ways over time. So again, lots of individual puts and takes, but I don't see - certainly I don't see any big structural headwinds that are going to come after us. Yeah, that's a great question. So historically, again, we've been more opportunistic and side by side in this. As the world is moving into a more sustainable operation, we're certainly doing our part and hopefully leading the way. This has become more critical for us going forward. So not only do we have 17 project, and we got another slate behind that that we're evaluating. And we'll participate in a different way than we have historically, probably in an equity basis, but probably not full ownership. And why I say this, we have a limited number of landfills. And so this is a great growth opportunity for us to pursue, but there's a ceiling to it, once you've kind of built it out on all the landfills, that makes sense. That's it. We like to put all of our financial capital and our human capital in places that we think grow in an evergreen way. And so that's where we'll put our attention. Combine that with the fact that there's a lot of external financial and human capital resources, who are anxious to partner with us. And we think that's probably going to be the winning combination for us going forward. Yeah. No Hamzah, I think we talked in our remarks as well, but we talked about here was providing visibility into where we see free cash flow going at this point. But that said, I think you also hear the tone. We're optimistic about the momentum in pricing. Volume is strong. And there's additional opportunities. And again, when you look at just the acquisition, rollover, as well as the pipeline of acquisitions that are there, we feel that 2022 is going to be very strong on that front as well. So contribution from multiple facets that at least relative to a historical growth weight rate, we feel it's going to be outsized. Yeah, thanks for your question. I think you have to look way back to low CPI environments. And we've always had this fundamental belief that we want to give our people a fair and certainly steady increase every year. So we were raising their wages that 2% or 2.5%, even in low CPI environments, so people have been focusing in parallel on employee engagement and making sure this is the place that the best people come to work. So you put those two things together, and we think our employee value proposition has been really strong. And while turnover has been elevated, it's been modestly elevated. And we've really - we would have taken more people if we could to pursue some incremental growth opportunities, but our attention has been really strong. Now, that being said, we're facing the same pressures of the macro environment. So we've looked and done surgery and targeted markets where we think we weren't as competitive or maybe turnover was elevated. But you kind of take those costs increases, and you offset it with what we think is our digital ops in our RISE platform, which is really driving productivity, we look at our performance. And in the quarter versus 2019, right, we're just seeing we're getting more work right out of the same labor hour. And that's been really productive. And I think you're seeing it hold in a very challenging environment. And then, on top of that, of course, we're pricing because the market bears it and we're want to support future wage increases for our employees. Yeah, we're really excited about that acquisition, great set of assets, gets us into certainly some geographic markets that we weren't in before. And that creates a basis or a platform for further growth, both organic and additional tuck-in acquisitions. As Brian mentioned, there's always startup costs in the first year. And the bigger the deal, the more the startup costs, because we really don't have to get multiple sites in the systems integrated. And there's a lot of employee benefits and related costs. And we really try to front load all those and get all those done at once. A, to get those behind us, but B, to create a great employee experience. And so if those linger forever, they feel like they're not really part of the company. We think that leads to higher turnover time. So we'd get after that and have a very proactive and intentional plan. And we're ahead of that plan. And I think you'll see in '22, that'll be a nice, certainly tailwind for us as those costs come behind us. And given the nature of that company, the fairly landfill centric, the margins are really attractive. Yeah. Walter the pipeline is - I mean, the performance has been very strong this year. And the pipeline looking forward is very strong. And I would say the power and characteristic of that is very, very balanced, right. It's balanced, certainly weighted more heavily toward recycling and waste just given that's where the bulk of our business is, but certainly plenty of opportunities in the environmental solutions portion of our business as well. It's certainly balanced across size, plenty of small tuck-ins. I think a number of what we'd call medium sized deals, and then listen, we maintain a perspective on everything. So could there be some larger deals that come through over time? Yeah, those are obviously more episodic, and can be - could be challenging from regulatory review. On balance, we have a very crystal clear point of view of where the regulation sits. And so if we think there's a deal that really is not going to get through, we just don't spend energy and time pursuing that opportunity. And or if we do have limited regulatory scrutiny on a deal, we've baked that right in, we understand what we probably have to divest and we go right to the regulators and say, here's our perspective. And then they can draw their own perspective. But we plan that right into the model. So we're never surprised on the back end of that. So, yes, there is heightened scrutiny versus four or five years ago on larger transactions, but more broadly, it's not slowed us down at all from I think, what is a different level of acquisition than we've historically done. Yeah, I think it's a good tailwind, again, we saw kind of - we were acted as ever. We saw times of uncertainty. I think if you go back 20, 25 years, special waste typically pushes right, jobs get sold and they get confirmed, but they just don't drop and get delivered. And so I think what you're seeing now is those things are starting to move. And so feel good about that. The pipeline is very robust going forward. It's a project based business. So by definition, right, there's going to be quarters that are a little higher versus others. But I think the outlook for the next 12 to 18 months is very, very strong. You're quite good at that, Michael, I trust you. Yeah. Certainly on the pricing, we would expect something starting with a three and then on volume look, we're coming out of a - we're in a V shaped recovery. And obviously, as the further along, you get this arithmetically, right, that slope starts to flatten. But I think there's still plenty of momentum, I talked about the labor side of being a little constrained there versus a pre pandemic year, you're going to see outsized volume growth in 2022 to for months. Thanks, Michael. Hey, Jerry. Yeah. And Jerry just a follow up there, again, we've been quick to act in the open market. You really haven't seen the contribution yet from the restricted portion of the business. That's still to come in '22 with a rollover benefit in the '23. Thank you. Yeah, we've certainly advanced the cause with our digital tools, I mean, our sales team is on the sales force platform and got a lot of lead generation tools across the different verticals in our business that populate new leads going forward. And we've certainly seen some of that, frankly, I think there's more of that to come, right, as we get through delta. And consumer confidence even gets higher here. And we quote, unquote, get back to travelling and back to business. So we're optimistic, there's more upside of that going forward. But we think we're getting certainly our fair share of the growth of more because we've got 1000 plus sellers out there working very local market to find opportunities, one at a time. Yeah. No, I think that's actually a really good starting point. I think a billion dollars in three ish years, I think is a reasonable target. We certainly will not race or reach to get there by any means. We certainly wouldn't be afraid to clear that if we think we have the right opportunities going forward. It will be a mix of organic growth and acquisitive growth more acquisitive than organic just in time percentage basis as we scale that business. And listen, that's been a really good fit for us in the early days, not only have they performed well, but we expected to see a lot of integration opportunities with our waste recycling business. And we're seeing a lot of those come through opportunity, internalize disposal, cross sell with customers, and it's just going to strengthen the value proposition of both sides of our business. Thanks, Noah. No, not really. I mean, listen, the supply chain is impacting us in weird ways. Like where we have a solar project we're putting in and we can't get them the equipment is trapped on a boat outside of Long Beach. So that project might not go in this year. But those are more incremental one off things and get we're blessed to be in a business that is a service based business, right and not materials based, or we will be probably suffering, like some of the other companies that are, so we feel good about that, but not in a special waste or C&D side. We think there's more demand coming back in that business without question, but I don't think the supply chain disruptions at attach anything to that part of the business right now. Yeah, so we start with everything on intrinsic value and returns, right. That's where we start from a fundamental standpoint. And any deal we do is going to have to clear that hurdle right individually and then naturally collectively it will over time as a platform. These businesses in general do have a lower margin profile than recycling and solid waste, they also have a different capital intensity. So when you think about free cash flow conversion, right, it looks very similar. And we do think there's certainly an opportunity to raise those margins over time. And, again, we have been incredibly consistent over the last decade on our commitment to pricing, right. And that we won't flinch or back off of that, right as we grow in the broader volume of services space, right, we are going to be able to price because we're going to provide a differentiated service and that supports us not only giving a fair wage increase to our employees, but then expanding margins and providing great returns to our shareholders over time. Thank you, Isley. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered double digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value for all stakeholders and expect continued profitable growth in 2022. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our customers. It is our team of dedicated employees that make these results possible. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "content": "Thanks Jon. Core price during the third quarter was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.2%, large container a 5%, and residential of 5%. Average yield was 3.2%, which increased 60 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter volume increased 4.3%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 5.4%, an increase in large container of 3.9% and an increase in landfill of 6.6%. For reference, small container and MSW volumes in the third quarter were both above a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Moving on to recycling, commodity prices increased to $230 per ton in the third quarter. This compares to $99 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 160 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Third quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $27 million from the prior year. This was driven by both organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same store basis environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 30.4% and increased 10 basis points over the prior year. This included a 90 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 50 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 30 basis point headwind from the impact of recent acquisitions, primarily driven by deal and integration costs. SG&A was 10.2% of revenue. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year, which was exclusively due to higher incentive compensation accruals. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion and increased $247 million or 22% compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by EBITDA growth in the business. With respect to our full year cash flow guidance, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. It should also be noted that we increased our expected full year capital spending in our upwardly revised guidance by over $50 million. This increase relates to capital to support growth opportunities. Free cash flow conversion through September continue to track ahead of our original expectations and increase 330 basis points over the prior year. During the quarter total debt was $9.3 billion and total liquidity was $2.4 billion. Interest expense decreased $11 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.8 times. With respect to taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 27% when you include non-cash charges from solar investments. We expect our fourth quarter equivalent tax impact to be approximately 25%. This includes the effective tax rate and non-cash solar charges. I will now turn the call back over to Jon. Yeah, Tyler, let me kind of answer the first part of your question there. I think you embedded two or three questions in there. So at least with respect to sequentially, there's a normal step down sequentially from Q3 into Q4, as well as we talked about the fact that we're doing more deals than originally anticipated. So we expect the highest level of deal and transaction and integration costs in the fourth quarter. So again, while we expect to see in the underlying business, we're expecting to continue to see really strong performance, we do expect a sequential step down Q3 to Q4. If you just take a look at the deals that have been completed through September, it's 160 basis points. Yeah and Hamzah to your question specifically on SG&A, we've had a number of those costs come back into the system as far as some of the travel related costs. So we're seeing that in the current period. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks most of the increase we saw really had to do with incentive compensation really didn't have to do with any of those ongoing SG&A expenses. So we feel pretty good about our performance and our ability to leverage, right, SGA going forward as we continue to grow the top line and migrate towards that 10% of revenue. Yeah. And the other thing too, Hamzah, is that partnering up with a third party, we can actually move faster than if we were to sit there and go our own way. And that's one of the reasons we want to move quickly on this opportunity. Yeah. And the follow up to that, though, is probably not as high, though, as what we're going to see in '21. It's somewhere in between. No, I just said to Jon's point, most of '21 was a recovery of units that were lost during the pandemic. My only point was that the volume at least the way we're thinking about it right now, would be somewhere in between what we're doing in '21, or what we're going to deliver and '21 and that hit historical average. Yeah, I think that CapEx is really more a function of growth, incremental CapEx, and these acquisitions with you, oftentimes, there's a plan and there's development projects associated with those, which are great. Those are more one time in nature, right, and then you get the benefit the returns of those in future years. And from a free cash flow conversion standpoint. Yes, right. We think we've hit a new baseline and we have plans to further expand that going into 2022 and beyond. That was excellent. Yeah, I would say you got to look back, right, we've already done that. We jumped on that pretty much in the mid to end part of the first quarter, understanding where inflation was going and you're seeing our open market not 100 BPS of incremental pricing versus the prior quarters, right because we're pricing not only existing customers, but also new customers, right. Our capture pricing tool, as we saw steel go up for example, on containers, right, we put that right in and so immediately we're selling at different price on the street, right to cover the cost of that incremental steel, right with a return against it. So we're not diluting returns as we price that through so listen, we're putting more price out. That price is being realized in the marketplace. And again, we have a good broad backdrop right when you things like bacon is doubling and all kinds of things are going crazy, rental cars and from just a consumer purchasing standpoint where prices are going or as these price increases are relatively modest against that backdrop, and I think that's a good reason why they're holding. Yeah. Yeah you could see it incrementally tick up. But we're also managing costs in a way, right, where we're taking the price and the cost inflation expanding margins, right. As we go, not only looking back, right, we're almost a 200 basis point expansion. If you look back a couple years, and we think we've got more room to run in that going forward. Keep in mind, we've price to existing customers, it's not a onetime event, right. We price rapidly kind of an open market, roughly a 12th of the book goes out every month, right. It's our ability to be flex up on that is really, really high. Yeah, we think there's a five or six core markets we're in that we would like to have an asset that was one over time we'll probably build if we could buy it, that would also be an opportunity, but probably something we'll build. Certainly seeing acquisition opportunities, smaller ones for recycling centers as we do some more medium sized deals going forward and apart because we want to make sure we've got a place to take the material off of our back and not always be dependent on a third party in those markets. And apart because we think these resources have increasing value over time, right. In a world where plastics, for example, the consumer packages, companies are really in a need for post-consumer content. And we haven't, and we're an aggregator. So over time, that material is more valued, we think we're going to be able to capture a piece of that as we move forward. And the other thing I'll add Jerry there's plenty of opportunities on our existing facilities, to drive in more automation to kind of change the CapEx and OpEx trade off. Those are tough jobs. Those are higher turnover jobs. And so it allows us to reduce the labor force just incrementally in those facilities, but then also produce a better product with more state of the art equipment. Thanks, Jerry. Yeah, David look, we'll get into details when we're back together in February on the components within the free cash flow, but I would sit there and say, as you think about over time, right, as Jon mentioned, we've made really good progress on free cash flow conversion. We expect to continue to make progress and start to drive that free cash flow conversion into the high 40% range, some of that is going to be by reducing our CapEx as a percent of revenue. Yeah, just right now, right, what we're kind of looking at is more of in line with a year-to-date average as compared to current pricing. But again, once this plays down, we have a couple more months on our belt, we'll be able to give you a better perspective when we're back together in February. Yeah, so the 160 is essentially, both gross and net, quite honestly. But yes, if you think about - that only includes deals that have been closed through September. Yeah, I mean, the core of the business, right, you should think of margin expansion or pricing ahead of our cost inflation, which we're certainly very committed to doing. And then there's some other pieces on that right commodity prices, right could create a drag, depending on whether that basket goes, but fuel was a drag in the quarter, right. You know that, in general, we price fuel and our fuel recovery fee is a pretty good broad hedge to fuel. But we have a little bit of drag as we go up, and then it happens a little bit of lag as we go back down. So depending on where fuel goes, but I'd say there's probably more chance that neutral or tailwind added in the next year. And then acquisitions, right, like I said, right, we kind of load up all those integration costs in the first year. And so we expect that to be a little bit of a headwind to the overall margin for a portion of that - the headwind in the equation, in the next year, but nothing dramatic, right. We're still committed to expanding margins next year with all those pieces put together. Thank you. It might be modestly more than that. As Jon mentioned we've got some of these projects right now, it's all based on what gets placed in service by the end of the year. I would say a good number to use through the cycle is in that 150 to 175 range. And that's all - yeah, predicated on some of the tax laws that are in place today. Yeah. I think it's a couple of things. It's yes, what you said on kind of the integration costs, but also, when you take a look year-over-year, we've consistently seen since the fourth quarter of last year, heavier container weights, that sort of thing. So that that probably will put a drag on the performance relative to the prior year. Yeah, it was it, I think it's - we're not going to put a specific year on it. But we are certainly trending in that direction. And I think you're going to see steady ratable improvement, right. I don't think you're going to see any big jump, or I don't think you're going to see us flatten. And it's going to be a consistent set of levers, which is we are going to continue to grow. We're going to price out of our cost inflation and give our people a fair wage increase to drive productivity right alongside that, and listen we're growing in a different way than we ever had before. Over time, we think that gives us leverage on SG&A, which further helps with the margin expansion."

Throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow. These metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore susceptible to varying calculations. A definition, calculation, and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow can be found in Exhibit A of our earnings release. We believe these non-GAAP metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Feeler: Thank you, Eric, and good morning to everyone joining the call today. I would like to begin first by personally thanking all of my colleagues on the US Ecology team who are working hard to continue to keep people and our environment safe for our communities. Our emergency response teams are currently responding to the wildfires that are impacting the western parts of the United States and Canada, protecting critical infrastructure that we all depend on. My thoughts and well wishes are with these team members and all of those that are involved for their continued safety in these challenging times. Turning to our second quarter results, for those that are following the webcast presentation, I'll direct your attention to Slide 5. Strong industrial trends and solid momentum continued to accelerate in the second quarter of 2021, allowing us to drive revenue growth across each of our business segments, with total revenue up 13% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Due to project deferment and unfavorable service mix in the quarter concentrated primarily in our Waste Solutions segment, our results came in below expectations, both from a margin and EBITDA perspective. We do expect to see continued improvement in the coming months and quarters. Turning first to Field Services, our strong execution in this segment delivered double digit revenue growth and EBITDA growth when stripping out a contingency consideration gain recorded in the second quarter of last year. This growth was reflected across substantially all of our service offerings. We are encouraged by the recovery and remain confident in our ability to more than offset the COVID-19 decontamination work that we had last year. Our energy waste segment delivered results ahead of expectations and reported its fourth quarter of sequential EBITDA improvement with rising disposal volumes driven by improved rig counts and related business activity. We remain encouraged by the trends in our energy waste segment with oil remaining above $70 per barrel. Our waste solutions segment returned to revenue growth in the second quarter with strong base business revenue growth, up 7% from the second quarter last year and is up 3% sequentially from the first quarter earlier this year, reflecting broad improvement in our end markets, including metals manufacturing, mining and E&P, general manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing. With this growth, our base business is up 2% in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months last year, keeping us on track to achieve our expected base business target growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. The growth in this segment reflects an overall improvement in the industrial sector that we are seeing in our services side of the business as well as those industrial production metrics that are being reported. However, some industry headwinds remain as customers continue to manage through supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and transportation shortages, while others, like our refinery based customers, are managing their maintenance spending to focus on free cash flow generation. We expect these headwinds to lessen over the coming quarters. Additionally, our base business growth is being further constrained by third party incineration capacity, which is causing restrictions in our waste receipts across the industry. Our waste solutions segment was impacted during the quarter by a 13% decline in event business compared to the second quarter last year, due in large part to projects shifting to the back half of the year and into 2022, along with the early completion of a few larger projects. The event business revenue decline had a disproportionate impact on our second quarter margin due to an unfavorable service mix as replacement projects were at a lower average selling price and margin profile compared to the second quarter last year. Overall, the second quarter we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $34.2 million and generated free cash flow of $11.6 million. Despite the year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA, we continue to see strong fundamentals driven by the industrial recovery as seen by our solid base business and services revenue growth, which is expected to continue into the second half of the year. Before I turn the call back over to Eric to further review our financial results, I want to provide a quick update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives. Providing environmental solutions for our customers' complex needs is at the heart of what we do, and we have compiled a nearly 70 year history of regulatory and operational expertise. This week, we released our 2020 ESG Supplement Report, which is available on our website that builds upon our previously issued sustainability report and includes more detailed disclosures based off SASB, an independent nonprofit that develop sustainability accounting standards. I want to take a quick moment and point out a couple of highlights from this report. On the environmental front, in 2020, we protected our environment by ensuring safe treatment, recycling, and final disposal of more than 4.6 billion pounds of customers' hazardous waste. We also treated more than 68 million gallons of wastewater and recycled more than 22 million pounds of metal and more than 1.7 million gallons of oil. We are pleased to report that 39% of our power consumption used in our facilities in 2020 came from renewable energy sources. We are making significant progress gathering our baseline greenhouse gas emissions data in 2021 and are on track to publish these results and reduction goals by the end of the year. On the social front, our Inclusion and Diversity Committee continues to promote our shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusion and improve engagement with employees. We are dedicated to promoting a culture of safety. And while we are already significantly better than industry average statistics, we continue to bring down the number of safety incidents and accidents across our organization. We also recognize the difficulties of the ongoing pandemic has had on our team members and have provided more than 46,000 hours of incremental COVID related paid time off for our team members to deal with these uncertain and trying times. We are proud of the special culture we've created here at US Ecology that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment, and continuous improvement, and we look forward to continue building on this strong foundation. With that, I'll turn it back to Eric.\nEric Gerratt: Thanks Jeff. Starting with consolidated results on Slide 8, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $240.8 million. Revenue for the waste solutions segment was $108.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, up 5% compared to $103 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was driven by a 4% increase in treatment and disposal revenue and an 11% increase in transportation revenue. As Jeff mentioned, the growth in our treatment and disposal revenue was due to a 7% increase in base business, partially offset by a 13% decrease in event business in the second quarter of 2021 compared to last year. The Field Services segment delivered revenue of $124.7 million in the second quarter, up 20% compared to $103.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was across most of our field services business lines. Total gross margin was 23% in the second quarter, down from 26% in the second quarter last year. Gross margin for our waste solutions segment was 33% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 41% in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting a less favorable service mix, which resulted in lower treatment and disposal margin as well as lower gross margin on transportation revenue. Treatment and disposal margin for the waste solutions segment was 38% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 45% in the second quarter of 2020. As Jeff mentioned, the decline in mix of event business had a disproportionate impact on our margin, and we estimate that approximately five full points of the treatment and disposal margin decline was a result of lower average selling prices on replacement projects compared to the prior year. Gross margin for our field segment improved to 15% in the second quarter, compared to 14% in the second quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative spending, or SG&A, was $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 and included $785,000 of business development and integration expenses. This compared to $49.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, which included $3 million in business development and integration expenses. In the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.2 million on the settlement of an earn out contract related to the legacy NRC business, which was recorded as a reduction of SG&A expenses for the quarter. Excluding this gain as well as business development and integration expenses, SG&A increased 3% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter last year. This increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation and benefit costs. Adjusted EBITDA was down 12% from the same quarter last year, which included the $2.2 million earn out contract settlement I just mentioned. Excluding this gain from the second quarter of 2020, adjusted EBITDA was down 6% in the second quarter of 2021 attributable to the decline in event business and a less favorable service mix in our waste solutions segment in the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year. Turning to Slide 9, we exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. Despite the lower margins compared to the prior year, we were able to generate adjusted free cash flow of $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. We had cash of 85.2 and $83 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of the second quarter. Net borrowings were $699.2 million at June 30, 2021. Turning now to our business outlook, as included in our release yesterday, we are revising our 2021 full year guidance as shown on Slide 11. We now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to range from $165 million to $175 million, down from our previously issued guidance of $175 million to $185 million. Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to range between 42 and $57 million, down from our previously issued guidance range of $60 million to $77 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is now expected to range from $0.37 to $0.60 compared to our previous range of $0.65 to $0.88. Revenue is expected to range from $940 million to $990 million, which is consistent with our previous range. Our guidance revision is primarily due to the deferment event of event business to 2022, early project completions, and large scale emergency response work that did not materialize in the first half of the year. With respect to event business, we estimate that approximately $3 million of adjusted EBITDA will shift out of 2021 and into 2022. The majority of this shift is due to ongoing pandemic related challenges that have resulted in delays in mobilization or delays in regulatory approvals at our customer site. In addition, two of our event projects coming into 2021 finished earlier than anticipated, which will impact our full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $3 million. Our guidance also assumes that we will likely - we are likely to see additional delays in deferments in the second half of 2021 as project sites continue to navigate logistical challenges due to truck shortages in the US and Canada. While these factors are impacting our outlook for the remainder of 2021, our business fundamentals remain strong, and the pipeline of event business opportunities and improved bidding activity should benefit us in 2022 and beyond. A lack of large emergency response projects in the first half of the year is also responsible for approximately $3 million of our downward revision to adjusted EBITDA guidance. As Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks, we are currently deploying teams to respond to the wildfires in the West, and we're still early in the storm season that typically runs through October. Finally, we are expecting additional costs and inflationary pressures in the back half of 2021 in areas such as labor, supplies, and treatment reagents. Though we can recover some of these increased costs or future pricing adjustments, the timing of these adjustments may not be completed in 2021. We remain encouraged by the underlying industrial trends and pace of business activity and we are seeing conditions strengthen across all of our segments. We anticipate additional recovery and growth in our base business and remain on track to achieve our 5% to 7% growth target for the full year. While growth in our services businesses has been limited by challenging labor conditions, we remain confident of the potential of this segment as we look ahead. Our energy waste business continues to show positive trends and will likely exit the year above our initial targets. Before I turn the call back to Jeff, I'd like to again reiterate that our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are seeing continued improvement across all segments. We continue to expect better financial performance in the second half of the year, both from improving fundamentals as well as historically strong seasonality that typically benefits us. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Feeler: Thanks Eric. We are encouraged by what we're seeing in the fundamentals of the industrial recovery and the current trajectory that we're on. We communicated at the beginning of the year that the biggest risk to our 2021 outlook was replacing and growing upon record levels of event business in 2020. While we are disappointed that continuing effects of the pandemic have shifted projects into the second half of the year and in 2022, we are encouraged by the bidding activity and opportunities and the overall health of the pipeline. As Eric mentioned the large emergency response events that have not developed in the first half of the year pose the risk to the second half and if they did not materialize. While these headwinds are mitigated by strong base business and services work, along with the positive trends we're seeing in the Energy segment, these risks to our initial guidance are difficult and were difficult to overcome in the remaining six months. Turning to our longer term outlook, we are still marching toward our five year targets with organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% per year, driving $100 million of free cash flow and achieving double digit returns on invested capital by the end of 2025, while lowering our leverage levels to two to two and a half times, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets. Before I conclude and open up the call for questions, I'd like to recognize our talented team here at US Ecology. This past quarter, I've had the ability to finally get out and travel to our facilities and sit down with our team members. I continue to be impressed by our people in how they continue to protect human health in the environment, while navigating through ever changing circumstances. We have the right people and the right assets to respond to our customers' needs, and we continue to be a trusted partner for our customers. And together, we are building a sustainable future for all. With the remaining focus on executing our strategy to drive long-term growth and value creation, I am looking forward to all that's to come. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, Jeff and team. Thanks for taking the Q's. Can we tease out on the guidance, since no change in revs, but changing EBITDA? Clearly, there's a bridge there where something is better, but something is worse and then the mix works down to the $10 million. So on the $10 million in the EBITDA you said $3 million is emergency response. What were the pros and then the other negative that get me to the net of the $10 million?\nEric Gerratt: So yeah, so the deferral on the event business from this year into next, Michael, is about $3 million of EBITDA. There's another $3 million on event business for projects coming into the year that were included in our initial guidance that have completed early. And so that's about another $3 million. And then you've got the $3 million for the large scale emergency response that was in our guidance that we didn't experience in the first half of the year. And then the rest is really a function of some of the inflationary pieces and things like that that I discussed.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. But sales are staying constant. So there's - if I gross this up into a revenue impact, there's an offset in revs that's happening as well, which means there's an offset in EBITDA, right?\nEric Gerratt: Correct.\nMichael Hoffman: So this - the negative is bigger gross, but there's a positive - I'm trying to tease out that there's a positive going on here as well. That's part of the business outperformed, the part of the business underperformed.\nEric Gerratt: Correct. And Michael, if you look at the revenue guidance, so there's the kind of summary guidance table in the release and if you look at the revenue by segment, for our revenue guidance the total is the same, but there is a bit of a shift between waste solutions to field services within that guidance range, which, again, that field services revenue comes at a lower margin than the waste solutions.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it. All right. I got - I'm on my 14th earnings call this week, so I haven't gotten to that yet. Okay. Corporate overhead, your number looks like it's really big as a percentage of revenues. Can you talk through what are the big chunks and maybe how you put things that some might put in OpEx versus put it in so that people appreciate this isn't some big target for an opportunity to slash and cut -\nEric Gerratt: Yeah. One of the things, as we look at our overhead or our SG&A, and it's hard to compare it to peers because I don't always know exactly what's included in theirs versus ours. But I know for us, the large component of SG&A, I mean, it includes labor for, obviously, the corporate functions as well as a lot of the administrative expenses and people at our facilities as well and within our regions. The other thing that's included in our SG&A is we have a pretty large chunk of intangible amortization, that relates to non-permit related intangible assets that the biggest jump in those was when we did the NRC acquisition in 2019, but we have upwards of $8 million of intangible asset amortization that flows through SG&A through the first six months. If you strip some of that noise the intangible amortization, business development integration expenses out of our SG&A, we're at about 16.5% of revenue at the end of 2020, we're around 17% year to date through 2021. But I think some of that noise that's within our SG&A and our overhead is that intangible asset amortization, which is a pretty big number.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. What's the incremental business - what's the incremental margin for business coming on in energy waste?\nEric Gerratt: I'm sorry, Michael. I didn't hear that.\nMichael Hoffman: I'm sorry. The incremental margin for energy waste as business recovers, what's that look like? Lots of the peers are in a similar business, talk about that being 70%, 80%. Is yours that good?\nEric Gerratt: Yeah. I don't know that it's 70% or 80%. But if you look at our revised guidance and kind of what we did in the second quarter for the energy waste segment, I mean, we had a pretty good recovery in our EBITDA margins. They were back in the mid 20s. And so I would expect - and as we look back at that business pre-pandemic and pre-acquisition, it's an EBITDA margin business that's closer to our waste solutions segment, so low to mid 30s in a normal environment, potentially higher, but we already made a lot of progress getting it back in that 25% range. The new guidance that we put out yesterday for that business, our EBITDA margin is 25% to 28%. So some pretty good improvement with more upside as it improves.\nSimon Bell: This is Simon here, Michael. Some of the comparables you're talking about, would they include the services component because I'm not sure that all of them do, which would also impact that incremental margin when comparing to just the disposal assets.\nMichael Hoffman: Yeah. Most of them it would be about disposal, so that's fair enough. And then on waste services side, based on commitment that you're going to do 5% to 7% for the year and you've done what you've done for first half at a plus 2% get to the midpoint, you're doing 12% base business in the second half?\nEric Gerratt: Yeah. It's somewhere around 10% to 12%. And really, I would expect that Q3 will be the largest. And part of that is it's typically our strongest quarter, and that's a lower comparable if you go back to 2020.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. So it's just a tough question, and I would like - I hope it comes across plate, not sounding nasty. Why model in a guidance for big things that require an event to occur you can't control?\nJeff Feeler: Good question, Michael. The reality is we modeled that in based off history. If you go back to all the way down into 2015, a lot of events have happened and a lot more than what we modeled in. And last year was with all the conditions being shut down and depressed, we didn't see much materialize. So if you go back look in history, those things occur. And so the reality is we believe those to occur in a more normal state, and we model them out what we believed at the time would materialize this year and still may materialize in the back half of the year.\nMichael Hoffman: And that's the wildfires or weather events?\nJeff Feeler: Yeah. It could be a whole bunch of different things. It could be chemical plant accidents. It could be a lot of things. I mean, we've had events in the past that a singular accident outside of a major pipeline break could be $20 million to $50 million, I mean, they are big events. We didn't anything like that in. And the reality is more smaller we define it as something over $1 million, which can happen. And we talked about this in our guidance and what was out there when we first launched it.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Yes. You did say at the time, specifically on the event side, I think, more so than the emergency response. What's the risk that these transportation restrictions on capacity there is just lack of drivers for paying people stay home persist through d fall into early '22. And therefore, does that - that doesn't provide any relief on the project activity? Or are there time lines on some of this that are mandated by a court order or what have you, where this is going to happen in '22 if it doesn't happen in '21. How do I think about that project number?\nJeff Feeler: Yeah, Michael. We have a number of different projects that are going to be mandated by regulatory drivers oppose it. But your bigger question is what the industries are facing with right now with driver shortages is real. I mean we're not the only one navigating it. Everybody else is navigating it, and it does create a headwind and we called it out. So when you look at risks into just project based work and even to a certain degree, our base business that has some inherent risks. I know that everybody is trying to - is looking forward to government programs getting released and other things like that, so hopefully more people enter the labor market. But that is a real risk that we're navigating, along with others in the space. So I can't quantify what that can do, but the reality is it's inherent in what we're dealing with right now.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJeff Feeler: All right. Thanks Michael.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much.\nJeff Feeler: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Silber: You talked a little bit about the truck driver issue. From a labor constraint perspective, are there any other pockets of labor where you're having trouble finding people or filling jobs?\nSimon Bell: Yeah. Jeff, this is Simon. The drivers are certainly the most challenging in terms of labor shortages. But the short of it is, yes, we're seeing challenges across the board, chemical operators, equipment operators, just general labor. It's different in different regions. But certainly, we're having some pockets where we're having challenges, and we're not able to fully realize the full potential of jobs out there. We've got a lot of programs moving, which we think are going to help us there. But, yes, it is beyond drivers.\nJeff Feeler: And I'll just add, Jeff, on that is we have a couple of hundred plus positions open that we're actively recruiting for. And it comes back to that fundamental is there's 9 plus million people in the United States alone that are sitting on the sidelines today. And all the data shows that there's over 9 million of job openings. So the reality is there is some impacts that we're hoping that we'll release here in the coming months on there to help mitigate what we're seeing. But we're competing for talent. We're trying to get talent. If we had more people, we would be able to drive more revenue. We are being held back on our growth potential right now because of labor. And we're trying to diligently compete for that and be able to get good talent in and being able to service our customers. But it is a reality we're facing right now.\nJeff Silber: All right. That's helpful. And if we can shift gears over to the pricing environment, I mean, we're hearing from everybody that they're able to put through price increases. I wouldn't say very easily, but - in a fairly easy method to some extent. Can you talk about what the pricing environment is out there, both from your perspective and from a competitive perspective?\nJeff Feeler: Sure. I'll let Steve address and I'll fill in.\nSteve Welling: Sure. So we did take some price increases in Q1 and Q2 in select markets. And depending on the service line, we do have the ability to potentially do additional increases in the second half of the year. We've been looking at that. It's a balance of whether \u2013what's the competitive market because we want to make sure we don't price ourselves out and losing work. What are the timing notifications because on our waste disposal business, we have, in some cases, 60 to 90 day notification to make an adjustment? So we're looking at what we can do. There are a number of areas we can move quickly. There are certain other service lines, though, that we are stuck with an annual adjustment. So it just really depends. But it's something that we have flexibility there.\nJeff Silber: Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks.\nJeff Feeler: Yeah. Jeff, I'll just add a little bit to this. I think the global takeaway on this is we do have the ability to push pricing through as Steve just talked about. And it depends based on contractual arrangements and that type of thing and the timing thereof. The caution we put up is we're \u2013we've been able to manage all the inflationary pressures for the most part to the first half of the year. Really, the notifications we're starting to see now and what we kind of put a headwind in part of our guidance is we're starting to see more of those starting to come through in the back half of the year. And we're really analyzing what the overall impacts are and timing of when we can actually start adjusting price, especially since we already did one price increase earlier this year. The last thing we want to do is be in raising prices every week on our customers because it's not good. So we're trying to get our arms around all of that determine the best strategies of when we go to market to make sure we can fully capture what we're seeing. And that's why we put a headwind it may not be fully implemented by 2021 and really focused on 2022.\nJeff Silber: All right. That's really helpful. Thanks so much.\nJeff Feeler: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: The next question will come from William Grippin with UBS. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Grippin: Great. Thank you. Just had one here on the EBITDA guide, it looks like the guidance implies a pretty significant second half ramp in margin versus the first half. I mean, you just talked about cost inflation pressures possibly accelerating here in the second half. Could you just give a little color on, I guess, what's driving that half-on-half increase in the margin?\nEric Gerratt: Yeah. I think the biggest - one of the biggest things is just additional activity that we typically see seasonally in the third quarter, and we're projecting a really strong fourth quarter as well. And so as that - particularly on the event business side picks up, some of that large scale ER picks up, it comes in at a higher incremental margin. So that's really the biggest driver of that lift you see from the first half to the second half, which isn't uncommon that we typically see each year, a decent sized lift in our second half over the first as the event business and the activity in the third and fourth quarters pick up.\nWilliam Grippin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nJeff Feeler: Good morning.\nEric Gerratt: Hey, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: So I hastily kind of put together this little Q - like the guidance from Q1 and the guidance from Q2. And I just want to kind of go through this because I got to understand the guide pieces. So if we start in waste solutions, you're looking for, call it, an $8 million, and this is all at the midpoint, so an $8 million revenue and a $6 million EBITDA. I think you fleshed that out pretty well, $3 million of deferral, $3 million of kind of projects that have ended early. So you assume about a 75% incremental margin there. So first off, is that a good placeholder for incrementals and decrementals in that waste solutions business? Or is there something unique there?\nEric Gerratt: I got to think about that, Tyler. That sounds pretty reasonable to me and not uncommon with what we see. So I think, yes, as that event business scales up and scales down, it can cut both ways at a pretty high incremental margin.\nSimon Bell: I mean, it's really defining the operating leverage these landfills have those incremental tons that come through really flow down to the bottom line.\nTyler Brown: Okay. So that makes sense. Now I'm confused on field services. So you raised revenue, but you lowered EBITDA by like $4 million. So why would that be? What exactly is going on there?\nEric Gerratt: So some of it, Tyler, well, a portion of it is the large scale ER that didn't happen in the first half that, again, similar to some of our event business comes through at a really high incremental margin on the waste solutions side. So that is a piece of it as well as just some of the mix and some of what we're seeing and some of the cost and inflationary challenges that we're expecting in that piece of the business that Jeff touched on a bit in terms of drivers and labor and some of those things. And if you look at the guidance - the revised guidance versus the previous, it's about 100 basis points of margin that went down in this version of the guidance versus the previous.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the energy waste side, again, kind of just like a funny change to the guide because you raised revenue by $3 million, but EBITDA by $6 million. And you guys talked about - I mean, again, I'm just kind of confused as to why that would go up so much.\nEric Gerratt: Yes. It's again, incremental. It's that incremental margin as it's recovered. We're also feeling a lot of the benefits of some of the cost cutting that we did last year on both labor side, rentals things like that. And so you've really seen us pick up traction really since the second or third quarter last year and seen that improving margin and so incremental revenue comes through at a better margin than it did say a year ago.\nTyler Brown: Okay. So you have those incremental cost cuts layering in, okay. And then just, again - just kind of, this is hastily put together, but it looks like the overall corporate costs also we're going to be higher, but I would have thought that incentive compensation would have been a cushion there or is that not the case? Again, this is all relative to the last guide, not to last year, but relative to the last guide.\nEric Gerratt: I would say there's some incentive compensation shift there, but that's about at least through the first six months in the guidance about where we kind of expected coming into the year. We are seeing some headwinds in terms of some of our benefits costs, some of our insurance costs, and then just overall labor.\nTyler Brown: Okay. So that's a lot where some of that inflation is picking up, okay. Okay. Well, that all is very helpful. So real quickly, I think you had talked about $50 million of EBITDA in Q3, is that a good placeholder?\nEric Gerratt: Yeah, I would say, right around there is about right. We actually - our guidance and our forecast, which - just to be clear, so our forecast is - our current forecast is the midpoint of our guidance and if you look at it and break it down by quarter, we're actually showing that Q4 will be a bit stronger than Q3. But Q3 is kind of about in that $50 million range.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Super helpful. And then on the interest cost and tax rate, just to make sure we have that I know you changed your credit agreement a little bit.\nEric Gerratt: Yes. So the credit agreement, really, the big change, the big positive change is we extended the revolver out another five years. We also, while we're at extended - or increased the covenant permanently. So it steps down and there's actually a chart in the appendix of the presentation for today that shows the new levels. But in terms of interest, we're expecting interest expense to be pretty similar to what we guided before, maybe a bit less. And then on the tax rate, we are seeing some of the change in the EPS guidance is we are seeing or expecting a higher tax rate than we were coming into the year in last quarter. A lot of that is due to, as we look at the forecast and where the revenue is shifting. Some of it is shifting into some of our higher tax jurisdictions, Canada is one good example. And we continue to see our state effective rate continue to increase. So there's about a 250, 300 basis point increase in our tax rate for the year now versus what we thought coming into the year.\nTyler Brown: Yeah. Okay. It's all like something was going on there. Okay. That's helpful. And then on the CapEx, so you held CapEx at the, call it, $87 million, how does that look - does it actually trickle up in 2020 and then kind of start to trickle down later or more into the mid part of the decade? Or how should we think about that, again, assuming no acquisitions, but just kind of looking at the business today?\nSimon Bell: Yeah. This is Simon. I would say 2022 is going to be another heavy spend on the landfill side. So I would expect probably a slight increase over 2021, then 2023 kind of returning lowering maybe to mid 80s and then really seeing benefits into the '24, '25 because of the reduction in the landfill spend. It was just a case, and it would be a long explanation, but we have to - with the most efficient thing and it made the most sense for us to build a large portion of the landfill in '21 and '22, pulling some of that spend forward, but we should see the benefits moving into '23, '24.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That's helpful. And then my last one here, I know there's some talk about truck drivers and such. I know a thing or two about that. But one other aspect is the railroads. So I'm curious, the rail - if you look at train speeds and dwell obviously, the rails are struggling. There's a couple of things. I'm curious if you're seeing increased accessorial charges or if you're seeing just an overall slowing in rail velocity if that is problematic for you as well?\nSimon Bell: Yes. Again, this is Simon. Tyler, it's something we're watching very closely, and we've heard about some of these slowdowns. But the corridors that we're using today, I'm not seeing a lot of impacts, not seeing a lot of delays that may be in part because a lot of the material comes from out East and heads East and maybe they're not dealing with the wildfires like they are out West. So something on the rail side today, I would call it stable, but carefully watching it.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Yeah. It could be your traffic mix, not to get into a long discussion about this, but yes, that makes sense.\nSteve Welling: Our business really isn't too dependent on the timing of the rail. I mean, it could result in the need for extra cars to rent. But for the most part, as long as it's leaving the customer site, they seem to be happy.\nTyler Brown: Okay. All right, guys. Thank you so much for the time.\nJeff Feeler: Thanks Tyler.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Feeler for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeff Feeler: Great. I just want to thank those for attending the call today and look forward to updating you in coming quarters.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Feeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning to everyone joining the call today. I would like to begin first by personally thanking all of my colleagues on the US Ecology team who are working hard to continue to keep people and our environment safe for our communities. Our emergency response teams are currently responding to the wildfires that are impacting the western parts of the United States and Canada, protecting critical infrastructure that we all depend on. My thoughts and well wishes are with these team members and all of those that are involved for their continued safety in these challenging times. Turning to our second quarter results, for those that are following the webcast presentation, I'll direct your attention to Slide 5. Strong industrial trends and solid momentum continued to accelerate in the second quarter of 2021, allowing us to drive revenue growth across each of our business segments, with total revenue up 13% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Due to project deferment and unfavorable service mix in the quarter concentrated primarily in our Waste Solutions segment, our results came in below expectations, both from a margin and EBITDA perspective. We do expect to see continued improvement in the coming months and quarters. Turning first to Field Services, our strong execution in this segment delivered double digit revenue growth and EBITDA growth when stripping out a contingency consideration gain recorded in the second quarter of last year. This growth was reflected across substantially all of our service offerings. We are encouraged by the recovery and remain confident in our ability to more than offset the COVID-19 decontamination work that we had last year. Our energy waste segment delivered results ahead of expectations and reported its fourth quarter of sequential EBITDA improvement with rising disposal volumes driven by improved rig counts and related business activity. We remain encouraged by the trends in our energy waste segment with oil remaining above $70 per barrel. Our waste solutions segment returned to revenue growth in the second quarter with strong base business revenue growth, up 7% from the second quarter last year and is up 3% sequentially from the first quarter earlier this year, reflecting broad improvement in our end markets, including metals manufacturing, mining and E&P, general manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing. With this growth, our base business is up 2% in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months last year, keeping us on track to achieve our expected base business target growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. The growth in this segment reflects an overall improvement in the industrial sector that we are seeing in our services side of the business as well as those industrial production metrics that are being reported. However, some industry headwinds remain as customers continue to manage through supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and transportation shortages, while others, like our refinery based customers, are managing their maintenance spending to focus on free cash flow generation. We expect these headwinds to lessen over the coming quarters. Additionally, our base business growth is being further constrained by third party incineration capacity, which is causing restrictions in our waste receipts across the industry. Our waste solutions segment was impacted during the quarter by a 13% decline in event business compared to the second quarter last year, due in large part to projects shifting to the back half of the year and into 2022, along with the early completion of a few larger projects. The event business revenue decline had a disproportionate impact on our second quarter margin due to an unfavorable service mix as replacement projects were at a lower average selling price and margin profile compared to the second quarter last year. Overall, the second quarter we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $34.2 million and generated free cash flow of $11.6 million. Despite the year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA, we continue to see strong fundamentals driven by the industrial recovery as seen by our solid base business and services revenue growth, which is expected to continue into the second half of the year. Before I turn the call back over to Eric to further review our financial results, I want to provide a quick update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives. Providing environmental solutions for our customers' complex needs is at the heart of what we do, and we have compiled a nearly 70 year history of regulatory and operational expertise. This week, we released our 2020 ESG Supplement Report, which is available on our website that builds upon our previously issued sustainability report and includes more detailed disclosures based off SASB, an independent nonprofit that develop sustainability accounting standards. I want to take a quick moment and point out a couple of highlights from this report. On the environmental front, in 2020, we protected our environment by ensuring safe treatment, recycling, and final disposal of more than 4.6 billion pounds of customers' hazardous waste. We also treated more than 68 million gallons of wastewater and recycled more than 22 million pounds of metal and more than 1.7 million gallons of oil. We are pleased to report that 39% of our power consumption used in our facilities in 2020 came from renewable energy sources. We are making significant progress gathering our baseline greenhouse gas emissions data in 2021 and are on track to publish these results and reduction goals by the end of the year. On the social front, our Inclusion and Diversity Committee continues to promote our shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusion and improve engagement with employees. We are dedicated to promoting a culture of safety. And while we are already significantly better than industry average statistics, we continue to bring down the number of safety incidents and accidents across our organization. We also recognize the difficulties of the ongoing pandemic has had on our team members and have provided more than 46,000 hours of incremental COVID related paid time off for our team members to deal with these uncertain and trying times. We are proud of the special culture we've created here at US Ecology that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment, and continuous improvement, and we look forward to continue building on this strong foundation. With that, I'll turn it back to Eric. Thanks Eric. We are encouraged by what we're seeing in the fundamentals of the industrial recovery and the current trajectory that we're on. We communicated at the beginning of the year that the biggest risk to our 2021 outlook was replacing and growing upon record levels of event business in 2020. While we are disappointed that continuing effects of the pandemic have shifted projects into the second half of the year and in 2022, we are encouraged by the bidding activity and opportunities and the overall health of the pipeline. As Eric mentioned the large emergency response events that have not developed in the first half of the year pose the risk to the second half and if they did not materialize. While these headwinds are mitigated by strong base business and services work, along with the positive trends we're seeing in the Energy segment, these risks to our initial guidance are difficult and were difficult to overcome in the remaining six months. Turning to our longer term outlook, we are still marching toward our five year targets with organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% per year, driving $100 million of free cash flow and achieving double digit returns on invested capital by the end of 2025, while lowering our leverage levels to two to two and a half times, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets. Before I conclude and open up the call for questions, I'd like to recognize our talented team here at US Ecology. This past quarter, I've had the ability to finally get out and travel to our facilities and sit down with our team members. I continue to be impressed by our people in how they continue to protect human health in the environment, while navigating through ever changing circumstances. We have the right people and the right assets to respond to our customers' needs, and we continue to be a trusted partner for our customers. And together, we are building a sustainable future for all. With the remaining focus on executing our strategy to drive long-term growth and value creation, I am looking forward to all that's to come. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Good question, Michael. The reality is we modeled that in based off history. If you go back to all the way down into 2015, a lot of events have happened and a lot more than what we modeled in. And last year was with all the conditions being shut down and depressed, we didn't see much materialize. So if you go back look in history, those things occur. And so the reality is we believe those to occur in a more normal state, and we model them out what we believed at the time would materialize this year and still may materialize in the back half of the year. Yeah. It could be a whole bunch of different things. It could be chemical plant accidents. It could be a lot of things. I mean, we've had events in the past that a singular accident outside of a major pipeline break could be $20 million to $50 million, I mean, they are big events. We didn't anything like that in. And the reality is more smaller we define it as something over $1 million, which can happen. And we talked about this in our guidance and what was out there when we first launched it. Yeah, Michael. We have a number of different projects that are going to be mandated by regulatory drivers oppose it. But your bigger question is what the industries are facing with right now with driver shortages is real. I mean we're not the only one navigating it. Everybody else is navigating it, and it does create a headwind and we called it out. So when you look at risks into just project based work and even to a certain degree, our base business that has some inherent risks. I know that everybody is trying to - is looking forward to government programs getting released and other things like that, so hopefully more people enter the labor market. But that is a real risk that we're navigating, along with others in the space. So I can't quantify what that can do, but the reality is it's inherent in what we're dealing with right now. All right. Thanks Michael. Hey, Jeff. And I'll just add, Jeff, on that is we have a couple of hundred plus positions open that we're actively recruiting for. And it comes back to that fundamental is there's 9 plus million people in the United States alone that are sitting on the sidelines today. And all the data shows that there's over 9 million of job openings. So the reality is there is some impacts that we're hoping that we'll release here in the coming months on there to help mitigate what we're seeing. But we're competing for talent. We're trying to get talent. If we had more people, we would be able to drive more revenue. We are being held back on our growth potential right now because of labor. And we're trying to diligently compete for that and be able to get good talent in and being able to service our customers. But it is a reality we're facing right now. Sure. I'll let Steve address and I'll fill in. Yeah. Jeff, I'll just add a little bit to this. I think the global takeaway on this is we do have the ability to push pricing through as Steve just talked about. And it depends based on contractual arrangements and that type of thing and the timing thereof. The caution we put up is we're \u2013we've been able to manage all the inflationary pressures for the most part to the first half of the year. Really, the notifications we're starting to see now and what we kind of put a headwind in part of our guidance is we're starting to see more of those starting to come through in the back half of the year. And we're really analyzing what the overall impacts are and timing of when we can actually start adjusting price, especially since we already did one price increase earlier this year. The last thing we want to do is be in raising prices every week on our customers because it's not good. So we're trying to get our arms around all of that determine the best strategies of when we go to market to make sure we can fully capture what we're seeing. And that's why we put a headwind it may not be fully implemented by 2021 and really focused on 2022. Thanks Jeff. Good morning. Thanks Tyler. Great. I just want to thank those for attending the call today and look forward to updating you in coming quarters."

Some of the comparables you're talking about, would they include the services component because I'm not sure that all of them do, which would also impact that incremental margin when comparing to just the disposal assets. Yeah. Jeff, this is Simon. The drivers are certainly the most challenging in terms of labor shortages. But the short of it is, yes, we're seeing challenges across the board, chemical operators, equipment operators, just general labor. It's different in different regions. But certainly, we're having some pockets where we're having challenges, and we're not able to fully realize the full potential of jobs out there. We've got a lot of programs moving, which we think are going to help us there. But, yes, it is beyond drivers. I mean, it's really defining the operating leverage these landfills have those incremental tons that come through really flow down to the bottom line. Yeah. This is Simon. I would say 2022 is going to be another heavy spend on the landfill side. So I would expect probably a slight increase over 2021, then 2023 kind of returning lowering maybe to mid 80s and then really seeing benefits into the '24, '25 because of the reduction in the landfill spend. It was just a case, and it would be a long explanation, but we have to - with the most efficient thing and it made the most sense for us to build a large portion of the landfill in '21 and '22, pulling some of that spend forward, but we should see the benefits moving into '23, '24. Yes. Again, this is Simon. Tyler, it's something we're watching very closely, and we've heard about some of these slowdowns. But the corridors that we're using today, I'm not seeing a lot of impacts, not seeing a lot of delays that may be in part because a lot of the material comes from out East and heads East and maybe they're not dealing with the wildfires like they are out West. So something on the rail side today, I would call it stable, but carefully watching it."

And depending on the service line, we do have the ability to potentially do additional increases in the second half of the year. We've been looking at that. It's a balance of whether \u2013what's the competitive market because we want to make sure we don't price ourselves out and losing work. What are the timing notifications because on our waste disposal business, we have, in some cases, 60 to 90 day notification to make an adjustment? So we're looking at what we can do. There are a number of areas we can move quickly. There are certain other service lines, though, that we are stuck with an annual adjustment. So it just really depends. But it's something that we have flexibility there. Our business really isn't too dependent on the timing of the rail. I mean, it could result in the need for extra cars to rent. But for the most part, as long as it's leaving the customer site, they seem to be happy."

Before I dive into some prepared remarks on the quarter, I'd like to personally thank all of my colleagues within US Ecology for their dedication to health, safety and operational excellence, despite the disruptions from the ongoing global pandemic, weather events and other constraints. For those that are following our webcast presentation, please direct your attention to Slide 5. The positive momentum we saw in our business in the second half of 2020 has continued into the first quarter 2021, with improving trends and overall business conditions across a substantial portion of our business. Overall, our first quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations. These solid results were achieved on the efforts of our broad-based team, that navigated the continued pandemic challenges and new challenges such as the extreme weather events impacting our Texas-based operations and customers and supply chain disruptions that are proving to be headwinds for many of our industrial-based customers delaying them from returning to pre-COVID levels. Total company revenue was $228.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 and was down just 5% year-over-year when compared to a strong pre-pandemic first quarter last year. Our Field Services segment was a bright spot with organic revenue growth of 4%. Our emergency response business was strong on the backs of continued COVID-19 decontamination work. We completed just under 2,700 projects and generated approximately $12.5 million of revenue during the quarter. This was a 13% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter last year and was the strongest quarter since the pandemic began. In our Waste Solutions segment, base business revenue was down just 3% year-over-year, as beginning to benefit from the improved economic conditions. Looking sequentially at our base business, it was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, much less than the sequential decline of 5% we experienced in the same period last year. Dissecting our base business by month, March 2021 was the strongest month of the quarter, recording both sequential and year-over-year growth. We anticipate base business will build on the results in March and record year-over-year growth in the second quarter, putting us on track to achieve our 5% to 7% growth target for the full year of 2021. Event Business revenue was down 9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year and was up 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2020.We continue to see positive developments in our pipeline with increased bidding activities, with market reopenings and expectations for more normalized business conditions as we approach the summer construction season.  Our energy waste business has now reported its third quarter of sequential EBITDA improvement, with increased treatment dispose and disposal volumes on improved rig count and related business activity. This allowed us to return to a positive EBITDA contribution during the quarter, generating approximately $1.3 million of EBITDA. Though revenues were down 64% in the first quarter compared to last year, they were up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing. While we are nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, the positive developments are welcome side and are better than we had expected to see last year. Overall, we reported total company adjusted EBITDA of $33.2 million, down 23% from the prior year, which was ahead of our internal plan. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $13.7 million during the quarter.  Before I turn the call over to Eric, I want to provide an update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives which we are working on in 2021.On the governance front, in February, we had announced the appointment of Mack Hogans to our Board. Mack brings extensive experience in leadership, strategy, M&A, governance and ESG programs. This addition along with others made in 2020 demonstrate our ongoing focus on board refreshment and our commitment to board diversity, not only with regard to gender and race, but also experienced and expertise as well. These ongoing steps we are taking to improve diversity both within our Board and our employee base has strengthened us as a company. On the environmental front, we have substantially completed gathering our vehicle fleet and emissions data and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Our vehicle fleet represents the most significant impact to the environment, given that our landfills have minimal greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when compared to solid waste landfills of our peers. With our baseline data in hand, we are working with our capital planning group and advisors to develop emission reduction targets below our baseline levels, despite expanding our fleet to support our growing field services business. We are also advancing sustainable waste solution services we offer to our customers, including investing and beneficial reuse technologies like aerosol recycling, container recycling and distillation recovery systems, which we believe are responsive to demands in the marketplace and are not only good for the environment, but also good for business.  Finally, on the social front, we know that it's essential in a sophisticated and competitive market sector like ours to have leading human capital practices. The starting point for us therefore is to look as widely, inclusively and creatively as possible to identify, attract and retain, promote and protect our top talent. Anything we do that needlessly limits our talent pool or just diminishes the effectiveness of our team members and their career prospects can adversely affect our employment value proposition as well as our overall culture. This means that our diversity, equity and inclusion are a core to our value creation and sustainability efforts and this is evident in the strength of our programs. To give a couple of examples, we offer a wide variety of industry-leading programs to meet our employees individual needs wherever possible. We have created regular and robust feedback loops, so that we can gain insights from all of our people, including our fresh size. And we continue to evolve our training, mentoring, promotion and retention programs to increase diversity, respect and inclusive ways of working throughout our company. We are proud of the special culture we have created, that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment and continuous improvement in everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\nEric Gerratt: Thank you, Jeff. Starting with consolidated results on Slide 8. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $228.6 million. Revenue for the Waste Solutions segment was $104.1 million for the first quarter of 2021, down 5% compared to $109.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to a 17% decline in transportation revenue and a 3% decrease in Treatment and Disposal revenue.  The decline in our Treatment and Disposal revenue was driven by a 3% decline in base business and a 9% decrease in event business in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter last year. The Field Services segment delivered revenue of $118.2 million in the first quarter, up 4% compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2020.  This increase was driven by increases in our emergency response, small quantity generation and total waste management service lines. Total gross margin contracted approximately 280 basis points to 23% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year. This was primarily a result of lower waste volumes in both our Waste solutions and our energy waste segments. Selling, general and administrative spending or SG&A was $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and included $1.2 million of business development and integration expenses. This compared to $52.4 million in the first quarter of 2020, which included $2.9 million in business development and integration expenses. Adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.07 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 in the same quarter last year. Adding back the impact of intangible asset amortization, cash earnings per diluted share was $0.14 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $33.2 million in the first quarter, down 23% from the first quarter of 2020. Turning to Slide 9. We exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. Despite the lower operating results compared to the prior year, we were able to generate strong adjusted free cash flow of $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. We had cash of $82.4 million and over $140 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of the first quarter. Net borrowings were $702. 9 million at March 31, 2021, which was an improvement over our net borrowings at December 31, 2020. Our bank covenant leverage ratio was 4.5 times at March 31, 2021, well under the 5.5 times covenant level for the quarter. We expect the first quarter of 2021 to be the high point in terms of leverage and that will be below 4 times at the end of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.\nJeff Feeler: Thank you, Eric. We are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing with quarter-over-quarter improvement across most if not all our business lines. With this and the improving industrial trends combined with our ongoing success in our NRC integration activities, we have reaffirmed our 2021 business outlook. This includes a forecast of growth for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2021. Diving into our integration activities in more detail. We continue to make terrific progress and we are seeing our revenue synergies really gained momentum here in the second year. We continue to see a path to meet our three-year target of $20 million of EBITDA synergies by the end of 2021, one year ahead of our original target. Slide 10 has a detailed breakdown of our 2021 guidance that was released in February of this year and that we are reaffirming today. I am so proud of the entire US Ecology team and their ability to step-up, innovate and drive value during these times. As the industrial economies recover, we have the right assets and services in the right places to capitalize and thrive. We continue to be a trusted partner to our customers and together we are building a sustainable future for all. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: I appreciate that you got, you opened the year a little bit ahead of plan, you're reaffirming the guidance and I don't think companies are supposed to be trying to chase their guidance up prematurely. How would you reflect on the trend inside the guidance though? Is this have more momentum to the upside than not given what you're seeing?\nEric Gerratt: I mean we're one quarter into it, another month behind us after today with April on here. And what I would say is, is the year is looking, the way we intended it to look maybe it's a little bit better. I mean there's a lot of green shoots that are out there. And our first quarter results, they were strong results given the fact pattern. But you also put into context some of the continued start and stop activities that we've seen with the ongoing pandemic, but we also had some major weather events that disrupted everything. So all in, I'm really proud of what we delivered in the first quarter. And I think it does set us up for a strong 2021. But there is still nine months to go. And we're going to continue to execute our strategy in our plan. And we have conviction in our guidance range that we released just back in February and reaffirmed it yesterday.\nMichael Hoffman: And when we think about cadence, is there anything particular about what happened is exited 1Q and what you know since March April, essentially done about, how to think about the cadence, is this sort of originally when we all have these conversations in February, it was kind of a steady, almost ratable March through the year. Does it picked up a little bit speed in 2Q or does it still stay pretty ratable as far as the top line?\nJeff Feeler: Thinking about the cadence of the top line, normal seasonality will play in and will drive it. So yeah, we're expecting Q2 to be sequentially better than Q1 and Q3, sequentially better than Q2. And they're talking about cadence from March to April, I would say, we're seeing similar patterns. And w -- when you get into the first quarter and look at it by month, March was the strongest month that we had. So all of that is pointing in the right direction. There is nothing that's given us a lot of pause there in their. And I would say that we're on track to deliver that range and execute on our plan.\nMichael Hoffman: And then you mentioned and it's not the first time I've heard this, but some of the supply disruptions are slowing the recovery of some of the customer base. That doesn't looks like that's going to get any relief in this calendar year. And is that, that's all accounted for in the guidance as well as that that you weren't looking for a big lift on reopening per se more of an overall improvement in the industrial economy broadly?\nJeff Feeler: So all of that factored in Michael in what we're seeing. And I think that that when you think about the choppiness we referred to in Q1, we saw it with a lot of closures and kind of the high rates of infection that we saw in the pandemic, we've seen that alleviate. But on the supply chain information, it is impacting our customers. If you go and read the detailed commentary on what industrial customers are staying through ISM and things like that, they claim, they can't meet their demand because one supply changes disruption, but also labor shortages. And those are some of the things our customers are challenged with to regain and get back to I'll call pre-COVID levels and growth there upon. And so, those are things that are all factored in. But we're seeing it in our customer base and it creates ongoing choppiness.\nMichael Hoffman: And then last two for me. Texas got snot beat out of it from a weather issue, power shutdown and you are not hiding behind any weather commentary. But I'm just curious if you hadn't had a loss of power for a week or more, what the difference in the numbers might have been?\nJeff Feeler: We haven't even tried to attempt to quantify that Michael. From our operational perspective, some of our business lines were down 10 and 10 days to two weeks, others reopened fairly rapidly, especially in our services arm and we had a little bit of freeze damage from the weather. But the reality is February was definitely impacted pretty hard in that region. We did see a nice uptick in March in that area, which probably is a little bit of pickup on there. But when we look at the whole of the equation, it's probably a setback because some of that business will never regain, because our customers were shut down. But for the most part, we still think that business conditions are robust enough down there that we'll be able to recover.\nMichael Hoffman: So closing the loop on that, you had a good quarter better than your plan and you had to deal with all of that. So if without it, it would have been that much incrementally better?\nJeff Feeler: Absolutely.\nMichael Hoffman: Debt repayment, are there any structural limits on any of the terms of the debt make whole agreements anything like that that can allow you to keep walking these numbers down as you generate cash?\nEric Gerratt: No. Michael, this is Eric. We're able to pay the facility down as quickly as we'd like. So there are no limitations on either obviously on the revolver, but even on the term loan B. The only limitations we have for the first year, there were some limitations on that, but that's, it's now wide open and we can pay down as quickly as we want.\nMichael Hoffman: And one last one, you opened the year saying we expect decontamination work to trend down. It was actually better in 1Q than your thought. Is it trending down or is it holding up?\nJeff Feeler: No, it's actually trending down. So we saw a surge in January and the first part of February, and it's been trending down since then, which is what we anticipated and it really follows the case loads that are out there. And from the good side of things that for me humanity standpoint is we are seeing ourselves getting ahead of this pandemic at least here domestically. And so, if we see a risen case load, I would imagine that business line will benefit from it and otherwise they will be replaced by hopefully resurgence of industrial-based activities. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: So just to be clear, there's not really much additional de-con work in the guide for the rest of the year?\nEric Gerratt: No, I mean, no.\nTyler Brown: Okay, that's helpful. And then, I mean, I know the reopenings difficult to discern free all. But and you don't talk a lot about monthly trends, but you did kind of make some mentions about March. Is there any way you can kind of let us know what base did in March or is it not really, just any color on exactly how much base was up in March?\nJeff Feeler: From a year-over-year perspective, directionally, it was up about 10%. Now, the reality is if you go back to March of last year, we probably, we were starting to shut down in the second week or halfway through. So probably, March last year was a little bit lower when you look at the monthly cycle on that. So I think that's elevated.  When you look at our base business for the full year, we are still confident that we're going to be able to deliver growth for between 5% to 7% on that and that's with us being down 3% in the first quarter. So everything is trending the way we expected it. It could be a little bit better than what we said on that side of things. But overall, when you equal everything out, we're still very confident in what we have for guidance out there.\nTyler Brown: And so, Q2 implicitly is like plus double digit range on the base side?\nJeff Feeler: I would expect a very healthy rebound in Q2 from a growth perspective.\nTyler Brown: And then, just, again, I don't know if you can put a finer point on Q2 just to help us with our models. But you say it should improve sequentially. I mean, are we talking something like $5 million to $10 million of EBITDA sequentially just to help us kind of get, because Q2 is just a really funny quarter?\nEric Gerratt: I think that's, this is Eric, Tyler. I think that's probably a reasonable range. If you look at our second quarter last year, we did EBITDA of just under $39 million. And so, I would expect us to be quite a bit better than that and that we can see laid out is probably reasonable.\nTyler Brown: Okay, that's helpful. And then, so Jeff, you talked a little bit about investing in your people and about your kind of human capital and how you're really focus there, which is great. First off, I'm curious how many drivers do you actually employ roughly?\nJeff Feeler: We're right around 250 to 300.\nTyler Brown: And so, how hard is that, is that group to retain and recruit in the current environment? I mean, we obviously cover the truckers. I mean there is a lot going on out there. I know it's a different business. It's more of a go home at night business. But curious, are you seeing like real, substantive pressures on hiring retaining in that particular group?\nJeffrey Feeler: We continue to see challenges in that group. And you nailed it. It's It's a demographic that it's not growing. And there's a lot of competing pressure, not only from our side of the world, but many other industries in there. So yes, we're continue to see challenges in there. Simon, maybe you can elaborate on some of the things that we're doing.\nSimon Bell: So this is Simon. It is a challenge as Jeff says. What we're doing is we're certainly launching programs that kind of provide retention. We're launching programs to kind of pay for schooling and encourage our employees to get their CDLs, really creating committees to better understand what is important to the driving community and what we can do to support them. As you mentioned, we do have both long haul and short haul. But certainly we think we can differentiate ourselves in some of the short-haul and really just listening to their drivers needs. And so, as Jeff said, it's something we are fiercely focused on, but, and we will be for a while I suspect.\nTyler Brown: So some of those jobs, like I said are a little bit more LTL in nature, where I guess are coming home. But there is a subset, where you're actually laying those guys down at night that that long haul piece, it's probably a little bit tougher to recruit?\nSimon Bell: Absolutely. I mean, you think of our retail program in particular that -- those guys will be on the road for several days and then definitely a more challenging?\nTyler Brown: Interesting. Okay. And then back to the NRC synergies. So correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm going off top of my head here. Eric, I think you of the 20, I think is the number you may be got 10 last year. I think you were guiding to something like 3 to 5. But then, Jeff, it sounded like there is more optimism there. So I'm just curious, are you basically tracking ahead of what you had originally thought on the synergies for this year, are we kind of right in line? You're just hoping that by the end of the year, you will be fully run rated.\nEric Gerratt: So we're tracking a little bit ahead of what we thought for 2021 and it's really driven on the revenue side of things and I talked about the momentum, that's definitely continuing. And we're seeing a lot of opportunities emerged as we continue to really get more of a cohesive sales group across the organization and driving those results.  And we're seeing opportunities there. So we do believe that by the end of the year, we'll have achieved that $20 million run-rate and there is potentially upside to that next year.\nJeff Feeler: And as a reminder, Tyler, the $20 million number was one that we put out at the time of the acquisition that we thought we'd be at that run rate by the end of 2022. So we feel like we're a year ahead of schedule.\nTyler Brown: And then just my last one. Maybe coming back to the energy business. So I think you talked a little bit about it Jeff for kind of talked about on the periphery. But obviously, oil prices have moved. I'm just curious if you're starting to see any green shoots out there in the oil patch. Are you starting to see any building confidence that maybe that business could be a positive delta to what you're expecting for this year?\nJeff Feeler: Well, Tyler, there's definitely green shoots in there. I mean, we definitely were ahead of plan and what we have anticipated on that business. We've seen rig counts increased dramatically from the low point, but they've increased, they've increased sequentially as well. And it's in both of the basins, both the Permian and Eagle Ford that we're -- that we planned. The reality though and the sanity check is we're still at 50% levels of where we were pre-pandemic. So all the trends are good. The activity is increasing. We're seeing a lot of green shoots out there. But we still have a ways to go to get back to that pre-pandemic level.\nTyler Brown: And then, just real quickly, can you remind me what the mix is? Is it roughly half and half Permian versus Eagle Ford or is it skewed one way?\nJeff Feeler: From a revenue standpoint, it's about half and half on there. So where our strength right now is in Eagle Ford, because we have two assets that we're put in place just before the pandemic set in and the Permian. Those are -- they are and they are trending positive, but they're still not to where we want them to be.\nTyler Brown: And is the CapEx on that business roughly set as then you've kind of developed the footprint of the landfills probably built-out the first cells. Are you kind of good on the CapEx side, so that when we do see volumes come back in it, there is not a tremendous amount of capital mean?\nSimon Bell: Tyler, this is Simon. We are certainly planning and moving forward with our landfill construction this year. So we're going to make sure we have capacity for whatever the demand is. And we're also continuing with some refurbishment of equipment. And certainly, we're planning for a recovery and we're spending our capital accordingly.\nJeff Feeler: And to just clarify that a little Tyler. The landfill Simon is referring to is the one in the Eagle Ford that that's the first one that was built. And so, it's current cell is almost, it's been operating for what four years and so it's just the next cell at that facility.\nTyler Brown: Good deal. All right, guys. Thanks so much for the time.\nJeff Feeler: All right. Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Actually, just wanted to follow-up from one of Tyler's first question, about hiring and wage inflation and retention. We talked about truck drivers. Are you seeing, if it is anywhere else throughout the company? I know, we've got a lot of other companies complaining that it's tough to find good quality skilled workers out there.\nJeff Feeler: I think everybody is competing for the same talent. I mean, the reality is, not only is are we competing against other companies, but my personal opinion is I think that there, we're competing against some of the government subsidy programs that are out there and that will hopefully will free up here the summer timeframe. But I think the combination of those two is creating a challenging condition to recruit frontline workers.\nJeff Silber: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the government subsidies. So I wanted to ask about the infrastructure plan. I know it's still early. I know there's just some proposals. Is there anything in there that you think might either help or hurt your business?\nJeff Feeler: Steve, why don't you address that?\nSteve Welling: Sure. Hi, this is Steve Welling here. What we've read so far is we look to potentially increase super fund clean-up work. There is possibly a proposal to add back the super fund tax on corporations, which will provide money for those types of cleanups.  There is also when you do infrastructure improvements, usually, that means there's things that get turned down, cleaned up first before you improve. So like bridges, there could be lead paints and other waste streams that come from that. Also seeing that there is some information about improvement at schools in urban areas, which they want to remove all the lead piping. So it looks like that would, it would be a benefit to us for sure. It's just we don't have much detail yet.\nJeff Silber: Sure nobody does, but that's actually good to hear. And finally, I think you alluded to this a little bit earlier. But you mentioned some of the starts and stops in terms of reopening. Are there any specific areas to call out that are doing better than others?\nJeff Feeler: So what we're seeing is the West has seen some positivity and really the Gulf. And they're the ones that are starting to have been reopened and are reopening more. When we saw the start and stop is we have a lot of operations in the Michigan corridor and they've been a hotspot. And so, that was a challenge in the first quarter. But they're getting things under control. And we anticipate that that to improve here overall. And then, internationally, Canada continues to struggle. They're not -- they don't have the same vaccination rates that we do here. And I think Ontario just walk back down or the province of Ontario. And so, they've been struggling there. But the underlying business still seems to be gaining traction and positive momentum even though they're going through some starts and stops.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks so much.\nJeff Feeler: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyson Bauer with KC Capital. Please go ahead.\nTyson Bauer: On the whole theme of pricing and inflation and treatment cost, whether it'd be freight or wage or other, some of the companies in the coverage universe have benefited from the inflation effects, others have suffered because of it. What is US Ecology stand as far as, are you able to pass those through, get a benefit in rising pricing environment or are you trying to absorb some of those treatment costs and that's may put a little pressure on?\nJeff Feeler: Steve, why don't you talk about the pricing in what we -- the strategy we've been doing this year and I'll have Eric kind of chime in on where we're seeing some inflationary challenges.\nSteve Welling: So in prior years, we've done more across the board tag price increasing and this year it has been totally different. What we did is some selective price increase in certain markets, on certain waste streams and then some specific geographies, where the customer base wasn't as impacted as others. So we have taken price increases in the first quarter. Most went into effect between January 15th and February 15th on base business only. Event work, we bid case by case. But we have been doing a number of things and we're also looking, whether we potentially, one of the possibilities for maybe another increase in mid-year. But we've been able to pass the number of things along. In terms of the transportation, generally, we have a separate charge like on fuel surcharge. That does -- when things go up or down there recovered. But for the most part, a lot of our pricing, on waste disposal side, we have the ability to do adjust. We do have some select service lines, where we're in a longer term contract. But that's not the majority of our business.\nEric Gerratt: And Tyson, Just in terms of kind of the categories where, we're feeling the most pressure in terms of costs. That we've talked a lot about labor, that that's probably one of the biggest right there with it insurance. Insurance is one that that everyone frankly whether in our industry or not, we're seeing pretty significant increases and have over the last couple of years, this year is not exception. Steve talked about transportation. We feel like we do have some opportunities there just based on where our contracts work to recapture, a lot of the increases there. So the reagents in commodities, that's another area. I would say, as the companies grown and as we've kind of diversified at that, that's not a significant of portion as it used to be US Ecology, but it is still a meaningful cost that we're continuing to watch and monitor. And there's some pressure there as well.\nTyson Bauer: Well, piggyback they targeted price increases. You only do that when you have the ability to do so. What are you seeing us as the greater leverage opportunities for you as far as certain business segments or waste streams that you can take advantage of?\nJeff Feeler: Well, like I said what we did already was in the mid-west, we've looked at some select waste streams and particularly known it has solidification, where there seemed to be opportunities. And we're just that much more than 3% to 5%. In West Coast, we're able to look at our customer base and do some things across the board in the West, that maybe we're not able to do in the Gulf. Right now, we're seeing the Gulf recovered, which was not at all in the first quarter, we're struggling a bit in the beginning. And then, we had to freeze. So we maybe looking to see if there's opportunities there in the future. But it's a case by case review. And we're just trying to see how things evolve as the roads get doing back to normal here.\nTyson Bauer: Do you anticipate, even thought they don't call it the green act that we may see some materials or other things that have not previously been considered as it is fall into that category going forward?\nSimon Bell: Tyson, this is Simon. There was long term, yes. I think there will be some certainly you think fast, but I'll say it's a, that's a generally fairly slow process in terms of changing the regulations. But certainly, I would expect this administration to be more aggressive on that front. But I certainly can't point to specific things in the near term.\nTyson Bauer: Last question. On the event pipeline, are we still looking at a lot more of the smaller jobs maybe the 5 million - 10 million or less as opposed to some of the larger discrete projects that are multi-year and have that?\nJeff Feeler: We still have a combination of both. We have some multi-year projects that are continuing this year, that we have a multi-year project that we had done work in prior years that was off a bit last year is kicking back in in the next three weeks. And then, we have another new long-term project that will be kicking off in the third quarter. So I would -- I don't think anything is really different in terms of that, it's a mix of all the above.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Peter Rabover with Artko Capital. Please go ahead.\nPeter Rabover: Just a couple of questions. One small one, how much was the Texas freeze or the storms, was that a beneficial or a negative impact for you guys in the quarter?\nJeffFeeler: Peter, we didn't quantify it, but it would have been negative in the quarter.\nPeter Rabover: Just thinking through next year. And then, maybe like a longer-term question. I mean, what are you guys thinking in terms of capital structure? I know you suspended dividend last year and were cash conservation mode. And I think you're back to be in fairly free cash flow positive and growing. And so, just thinking, what's your ideal capital structure, what are your plans for capital allocation any, you have some warrants out there or so? Just anything you guys can comment on that will be appreciated.\nEric Gerratt: So our capital deployment plan is really focused on organic capital investment, paying down debt, doing small tuck-in acquisitions if they come available and then we'll be looking at returning any capital to shareholders likely in 2022.\nJeff Feeler: All right, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Feeler for any closing remarks.\nJeff Feeler: Well, I just want to thank you for your interest today and looking forward to updating you in future conferences here in the second quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeff Feeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric and good morning to everyone joining the call today. Before I dive into some prepared remarks on the quarter, I'd like to personally thank all of my colleagues within US Ecology for their dedication to health, safety and operational excellence, despite the disruptions from the ongoing global pandemic, weather events and other constraints. For those that are following our webcast presentation, please direct your attention to Slide 5. The positive momentum we saw in our business in the second half of 2020 has continued into the first quarter 2021, with improving trends and overall business conditions across a substantial portion of our business. Overall, our first quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations. These solid results were achieved on the efforts of our broad-based team, that navigated the continued pandemic challenges and new challenges such as the extreme weather events impacting our Texas-based operations and customers and supply chain disruptions that are proving to be headwinds for many of our industrial-based customers delaying them from returning to pre-COVID levels. Total company revenue was $228.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 and was down just 5% year-over-year when compared to a strong pre-pandemic first quarter last year. Our Field Services segment was a bright spot with organic revenue growth of 4%. Our emergency response business was strong on the backs of continued COVID-19 decontamination work. We completed just under 2,700 projects and generated approximately $12.5 million of revenue during the quarter. This was a 13% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter last year and was the strongest quarter since the pandemic began. In our Waste Solutions segment, base business revenue was down just 3% year-over-year, as beginning to benefit from the improved economic conditions. Looking sequentially at our base business, it was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, much less than the sequential decline of 5% we experienced in the same period last year. Dissecting our base business by month, March 2021 was the strongest month of the quarter, recording both sequential and year-over-year growth. We anticipate base business will build on the results in March and record year-over-year growth in the second quarter, putting us on track to achieve our 5% to 7% growth target for the full year of 2021. Event Business revenue was down 9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year and was up 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2020.We continue to see positive developments in our pipeline with increased bidding activities, with market reopenings and expectations for more normalized business conditions as we approach the summer construction season.  Our energy waste business has now reported its third quarter of sequential EBITDA improvement, with increased treatment dispose and disposal volumes on improved rig count and related business activity. This allowed us to return to a positive EBITDA contribution during the quarter, generating approximately $1.3 million of EBITDA. Though revenues were down 64% in the first quarter compared to last year, they were up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing. While we are nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, the positive developments are welcome side and are better than we had expected to see last year. Overall, we reported total company adjusted EBITDA of $33.2 million, down 23% from the prior year, which was ahead of our internal plan. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $13.7 million during the quarter.  Before I turn the call over to Eric, I want to provide an update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives which we are working on in 2021.On the governance front, in February, we had announced the appointment of Mack Hogans to our Board. Mack brings extensive experience in leadership, strategy, M&A, governance and ESG programs. This addition along with others made in 2020 demonstrate our ongoing focus on board refreshment and our commitment to board diversity, not only with regard to gender and race, but also experienced and expertise as well. These ongoing steps we are taking to improve diversity both within our Board and our employee base has strengthened us as a company. On the environmental front, we have substantially completed gathering our vehicle fleet and emissions data and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Our vehicle fleet represents the most significant impact to the environment, given that our landfills have minimal greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when compared to solid waste landfills of our peers. With our baseline data in hand, we are working with our capital planning group and advisors to develop emission reduction targets below our baseline levels, despite expanding our fleet to support our growing field services business. We are also advancing sustainable waste solution services we offer to our customers, including investing and beneficial reuse technologies like aerosol recycling, container recycling and distillation recovery systems, which we believe are responsive to demands in the marketplace and are not only good for the environment, but also good for business.  Finally, on the social front, we know that it's essential in a sophisticated and competitive market sector like ours to have leading human capital practices. The starting point for us therefore is to look as widely, inclusively and creatively as possible to identify, attract and retain, promote and protect our top talent. Anything we do that needlessly limits our talent pool or just diminishes the effectiveness of our team members and their career prospects can adversely affect our employment value proposition as well as our overall culture. This means that our diversity, equity and inclusion are a core to our value creation and sustainability efforts and this is evident in the strength of our programs. To give a couple of examples, we offer a wide variety of industry-leading programs to meet our employees individual needs wherever possible. We have created regular and robust feedback loops, so that we can gain insights from all of our people, including our fresh size. And we continue to evolve our training, mentoring, promotion and retention programs to increase diversity, respect and inclusive ways of working throughout our company. We are proud of the special culture we have created, that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment and continuous improvement in everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Thank you, Eric. We are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing with quarter-over-quarter improvement across most if not all our business lines. With this and the improving industrial trends combined with our ongoing success in our NRC integration activities, we have reaffirmed our 2021 business outlook. This includes a forecast of growth for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2021. Diving into our integration activities in more detail. We continue to make terrific progress and we are seeing our revenue synergies really gained momentum here in the second year. We continue to see a path to meet our three-year target of $20 million of EBITDA synergies by the end of 2021, one year ahead of our original target. Slide 10 has a detailed breakdown of our 2021 guidance that was released in February of this year and that we are reaffirming today. I am so proud of the entire US Ecology team and their ability to step-up, innovate and drive value during these times. As the industrial economies recover, we have the right assets and services in the right places to capitalize and thrive. We continue to be a trusted partner to our customers and together we are building a sustainable future for all. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Thinking about the cadence of the top line, normal seasonality will play in and will drive it. So yeah, we're expecting Q2 to be sequentially better than Q1 and Q3, sequentially better than Q2. And they're talking about cadence from March to April, I would say, we're seeing similar patterns. And w -- when you get into the first quarter and look at it by month, March was the strongest month that we had. So all of that is pointing in the right direction. There is nothing that's given us a lot of pause there in their. And I would say that we're on track to deliver that range and execute on our plan. So all of that factored in Michael in what we're seeing. And I think that that when you think about the choppiness we referred to in Q1, we saw it with a lot of closures and kind of the high rates of infection that we saw in the pandemic, we've seen that alleviate. But on the supply chain information, it is impacting our customers. If you go and read the detailed commentary on what industrial customers are staying through ISM and things like that, they claim, they can't meet their demand because one supply changes disruption, but also labor shortages. And those are some of the things our customers are challenged with to regain and get back to I'll call pre-COVID levels and growth there upon. And so, those are things that are all factored in. But we're seeing it in our customer base and it creates ongoing choppiness. We haven't even tried to attempt to quantify that Michael. From our operational perspective, some of our business lines were down 10 and 10 days to two weeks, others reopened fairly rapidly, especially in our services arm and we had a little bit of freeze damage from the weather. But the reality is February was definitely impacted pretty hard in that region. We did see a nice uptick in March in that area, which probably is a little bit of pickup on there. But when we look at the whole of the equation, it's probably a setback because some of that business will never regain, because our customers were shut down. But for the most part, we still think that business conditions are robust enough down there that we'll be able to recover. Absolutely. No, it's actually trending down. So we saw a surge in January and the first part of February, and it's been trending down since then, which is what we anticipated and it really follows the case loads that are out there. And from the good side of things that for me humanity standpoint is we are seeing ourselves getting ahead of this pandemic at least here domestically. And so, if we see a risen case load, I would imagine that business line will benefit from it and otherwise they will be replaced by hopefully resurgence of industrial-based activities. Thanks, Michael. From a year-over-year perspective, directionally, it was up about 10%. Now, the reality is if you go back to March of last year, we probably, we were starting to shut down in the second week or halfway through. So probably, March last year was a little bit lower when you look at the monthly cycle on that. So I think that's elevated.  When you look at our base business for the full year, we are still confident that we're going to be able to deliver growth for between 5% to 7% on that and that's with us being down 3% in the first quarter. So everything is trending the way we expected it. It could be a little bit better than what we said on that side of things. But overall, when you equal everything out, we're still very confident in what we have for guidance out there. I would expect a very healthy rebound in Q2 from a growth perspective. We're right around 250 to 300. And as a reminder, Tyler, the $20 million number was one that we put out at the time of the acquisition that we thought we'd be at that run rate by the end of 2022. So we feel like we're a year ahead of schedule. Well, Tyler, there's definitely green shoots in there. I mean, we definitely were ahead of plan and what we have anticipated on that business. We've seen rig counts increased dramatically from the low point, but they've increased, they've increased sequentially as well. And it's in both of the basins, both the Permian and Eagle Ford that we're -- that we planned. The reality though and the sanity check is we're still at 50% levels of where we were pre-pandemic. So all the trends are good. The activity is increasing. We're seeing a lot of green shoots out there. But we still have a ways to go to get back to that pre-pandemic level. From a revenue standpoint, it's about half and half on there. So where our strength right now is in Eagle Ford, because we have two assets that we're put in place just before the pandemic set in and the Permian. Those are -- they are and they are trending positive, but they're still not to where we want them to be. And to just clarify that a little Tyler. The landfill Simon is referring to is the one in the Eagle Ford that that's the first one that was built. And so, it's current cell is almost, it's been operating for what four years and so it's just the next cell at that facility. All right. Thanks, Tyler. I think everybody is competing for the same talent. I mean, the reality is, not only is are we competing against other companies, but my personal opinion is I think that there, we're competing against some of the government subsidy programs that are out there and that will hopefully will free up here the summer timeframe. But I think the combination of those two is creating a challenging condition to recruit frontline workers. Steve, why don't you address that? So what we're seeing is the West has seen some positivity and really the Gulf. And they're the ones that are starting to have been reopened and are reopening more. When we saw the start and stop is we have a lot of operations in the Michigan corridor and they've been a hotspot. And so, that was a challenge in the first quarter. But they're getting things under control. And we anticipate that that to improve here overall. And then, internationally, Canada continues to struggle. They're not -- they don't have the same vaccination rates that we do here. And I think Ontario just walk back down or the province of Ontario. And so, they've been struggling there. But the underlying business still seems to be gaining traction and positive momentum even though they're going through some starts and stops. Thanks, Jeff. Steve, why don't you talk about the pricing in what we -- the strategy we've been doing this year and I'll have Eric kind of chime in on where we're seeing some inflationary challenges. Well, like I said what we did already was in the mid-west, we've looked at some select waste streams and particularly known it has solidification, where there seemed to be opportunities. And we're just that much more than 3% to 5%. In West Coast, we're able to look at our customer base and do some things across the board in the West, that maybe we're not able to do in the Gulf. Right now, we're seeing the Gulf recovered, which was not at all in the first quarter, we're struggling a bit in the beginning. And then, we had to freeze. So we maybe looking to see if there's opportunities there in the future. But it's a case by case review. And we're just trying to see how things evolve as the roads get doing back to normal here. We still have a combination of both. We have some multi-year projects that are continuing this year, that we have a multi-year project that we had done work in prior years that was off a bit last year is kicking back in in the next three weeks. And then, we have another new long-term project that will be kicking off in the third quarter. So I would -- I don't think anything is really different in terms of that, it's a mix of all the above. Peter, we didn't quantify it, but it would have been negative in the quarter. All right, thank you. Well, I just want to thank you for your interest today and looking forward to updating you in future conferences here in the second quarter."

            "name": "Simon Bell",
            "content": "So this is Simon. It is a challenge as Jeff says. What we're doing is we're certainly launching programs that kind of provide retention. We're launching programs to kind of pay for schooling and encourage our employees to get their CDLs, really creating committees to better understand what is important to the driving community and what we can do to support them. As you mentioned, we do have both long haul and short haul. But certainly we think we can differentiate ourselves in some of the short-haul and really just listening to their drivers needs. And so, as Jeff said, it's something we are fiercely focused on, but, and we will be for a while I suspect. Absolutely. I mean, you think of our retail program in particular that -- those guys will be on the road for several days and then definitely a more challenging? Tyler, this is Simon. We are certainly planning and moving forward with our landfill construction this year. So we're going to make sure we have capacity for whatever the demand is. And we're also continuing with some refurbishment of equipment. And certainly, we're planning for a recovery and we're spending our capital accordingly. Tyson, this is Simon. There was long term, yes. I think there will be some certainly you think fast, but I'll say it's a, that's a generally fairly slow process in terms of changing the regulations. But certainly, I would expect this administration to be more aggressive on that front. But I certainly can't point to specific things in the near term."

            "content": "Sure. Hi, this is Steve Welling here. What we've read so far is we look to potentially increase super fund clean-up work. There is possibly a proposal to add back the super fund tax on corporations, which will provide money for those types of cleanups.  There is also when you do infrastructure improvements, usually, that means there's things that get turned down, cleaned up first before you improve. So like bridges, there could be lead paints and other waste streams that come from that. Also seeing that there is some information about improvement at schools in urban areas, which they want to remove all the lead piping. So it looks like that would, it would be a benefit to us for sure. It's just we don't have much detail yet. So in prior years, we've done more across the board tag price increasing and this year it has been totally different. What we did is some selective price increase in certain markets, on certain waste streams and then some specific geographies, where the customer base wasn't as impacted as others.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year, delivering results that exceeded our full year guidance, even in the face of increased volatility in the broader marketplace. During 2022, we achieved revenue growth of 20%, including a 10% from acquisitions; delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 16%; generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.93, which is an 18% increase over the prior year; and produced $1.74 billion of adjusted free cash flow, a 15% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $2.7 billion in acquisitions in 2022, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is going well, with cost synergies tracking ahead of plan. Revenue contribution from US Ecology outperformed our expectations by nearly $50 million for the year, with almost all of the overperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. We continue to adjust prices related to US Ecology and our broader Environmental Solutions business to better align with the capital invested and resources deployed. Pricing actions taken to date have been successful as our customers recognize the high value of service we provide. Additionally, we are building momentum cross-selling our complete set of products and services, with approximately $40 million in new sales to date. Aside from US Ecology, we invested $500 million in value-creating acquisitions during the year. All of these deals were in the recycling and solid waste space. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Regarding Customer Zeal, we continue to enhance our culture of delivering a world-class customer experience to win new business and drive customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at 94%, and we exited 2022 with our highest NPS scores of the year. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter, with simultaneous growth in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue increased to 8.4% and average yield on related revenue increased to 6.7%. This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Organic volume growth was 1.5%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Moving to digital. In early 2022, we implemented the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which streamline back-office activities and provide our local leaders with enhanced data. Currently, we are building our new asset management system, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and drive better warranty recovery. We expect to implement the new asset management system beginning in 2024. We continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. We finished the implementation for all large container and small container routes during 2022 and completed 37% of residential routes by the end of the year. The remaining residential routes are scheduled to be complete by mid-2023. This is a key component enabling further connectivity with our customers, including real-time service notification. The adoption of RISE has helped drive operational efficiencies and cost savings worth approximately $50 million annually. Sustainability is core to our strategy and one of our differentiating capabilities. We believe Republic Services is in a unique position to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth, while making a positive impact on the environment. For example, our polymer centers are advancing circularity of plastics. This is the first time a single U.S. company will manage the plastic stream from current site collection to delivery of high-quality recycled content for consumer packaging. Development of the first center in Las Vegas is on track and is slated to come online in late 2023. Development of our second polymer center is already underway. This facility will be located in the Midwest and will serve as a hub for aggregating and processing recovered plastics in the region. This center should come online in late 2024. The investments we are making to develop these polymer centers is being absorbed through our normal capital expenditure process. Additionally, the development of our renewable natural gas projects is progressing well. All 57 of these projects are being co-developed with partners, with the majority structured as a joint venture. We expect 4 of these projects to come online by mid-2023. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be a workplace where the best people from all backgrounds come to work. Employee engagement improved to a score of 85, with 97% participation. Turnover rates in the fourth quarter improved to the lowest level we've experienced in nearly two years. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the seventh consecutive year. Our 2022 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and strengthens the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. Looking forward, we expect to deliver high single-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2023, even with the headwinds from lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates. More specifically, we expect 2022 revenues in a range of $14.65 billion to $14.8 billion. This represents high single-digit growth compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. This represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.15 to $5.23 and generate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion. Our acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity in both Recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in2023. Our 2023 financial guidance includes a rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2022. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.4%, which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.1%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 8.6%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9%. Average yield on related revenue was 6.7%, an increase of 40 basis points when compared to our third quarter performance. In 2023, we expect average yield on total revenue of approximately 5.5%. We expect average yield on related revenue of approximately 6.5%. This is an increase of 80 basis points over our full year 2022 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 1.5%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 1.6%, an increase in large container of 60 basis points, an increase in residential of 1.2% and an increase in landfill of 3.9%. For 2023, we expect organic volume growth in a range of 50 basis points to 1%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $88 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 180 basis points during the quarter. 2022 full year commodity prices were $170 per ton. This compared to $187 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. We believe that current commodity prices are temporarily depressed due to a global supply/demand imbalance and that prices will recover in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are assuming average recycled commodity prices of $125 per ton in 2023, with prices starting at $95 per ton in the first quarter and steadily increasing throughout the year. At $125 per ton, this would result in a decrease in full year 2023 revenue and EBITDA of $45 million when compared to the prior year and a 30 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. In the first quarter of 2023, this would result in a year-on-year decrease of nearly $30 million in revenue and EBITDA and a 70 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased approximately $320 million over the prior year, which primarily related to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.3%. This compares to 28.1% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which included 100 basis points related to US Ecology, and an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 20 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 28.7%. This compares to 28.6% margin in the prior year or 10 basis points of margin expansion. Margins improved in the Recycling and Solid Waste business even with an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 10.9% of revenue. This included 40 basis points from additional incentive compensation expense due to full year financial outperformance. Full year SG&A expenses were 10.2% of revenue. This was favorable 20 basis points compared to the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. In 2023, we expect EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.2%. The 10 basis points of expected margin expansion include a 40 basis point decline related to acquisitions, primarily related to US Ecology, and a 30 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These headwinds are more than offset by margin expansion in the underlying business of 80 basis points. While we expect full year expansion compared to the prior year, margins are expected to be down in the first half due to the impact of acquisition rollover and recycled commodity prices. This is most notable in the first quarter where these headwinds impact margin by a combined 210 basis points. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was 10.7% of revenue in 2022 and is expected to be relatively consistent at 10.8% of revenue in 2023. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. For 2023, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion or approximately 8% growth at the midpoint. We believe this level of performance is very strong given the expected impact from lower recycled commodity prices, higher interest rates, and higher cash taxes as bonus depreciation begins to unwind. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.9 billion, and total liquidity was $1.7 billion. Floating debt interest rates consistently increased throughout 2022, and we now expect net interest expense of approximately$480 million in 2023. This is an increase of approximately $90 million compared to the prior year. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in approximately $33 million of additional interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was approximately 3.1 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage by mid-2023. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.1% during the fourth quarter and 25.1% for the full year. This lower than anticipated tax rate resulted in a $0.06 benefit to our full year 2022 EPS. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2023, made up of an adjusted effective tax rate of 20% and approximately $170 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Finally, we expect a majority of the EPS growth in 2023 to be back-end loaded. This results from having the toughest prior year comparisons on recycled commodity prices, interest rates, and taxes during the first half of the year. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, guys.\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Brian, so obviously, pricing really strong here. I think full year pricing in the open market would stay just over 9% in the restricted piece, call it, 4.5%. But I am curious if we were to kind of decompose that next year, how those numbers would look? Will we kind of see a convergence in those two? Or could we actually see the restricted pricing lead with all the CPI lookbacks?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: No, we would actually expect the restricted pricing to increase from the levels of where it is in the fourth quarter. So, again, on related revenue, it was 5.1% restricted in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to improve 50 to 100 basis points in 2023. But we do expect the level of pricing to be driven by the open market, similar to what you've seen in 2022 and, for that matter, the prior years as well.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the shape of kind of how the yields will progress, will we have a more, I'm going to call it, historically normal cadence where pricing -- and I'm talking total pricing, say, above 5.5% and then it tapers off below 5.5% as the year finishes out?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Listen, I guess you're talking about then on total revenue, so I'll give you that piece. So, yes, it starts highest -- actually, our high watermark is in the first quarter based on our expectations. And then it sequentially declines from there, but we're expecting that pricing remains above 5% in all quarters.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And just real quick, how much M&A rollover is in the guide? And just to be crystal clear, the $0.5 billion that you expect to spend, none of that is included in guidance. Is that right?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, I'll answer your second question first. That is correct. We have not included that. So, what is included are deals that closed by the end of the year. It's $440 million worth of revenue or 300 basis points of growth, that's the rollover, and most of that being US Ecology.\nTyler Brown: Right, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the questions. So, with the US Ecology outperformance of $50 million, can you give us a breakdown of how much of that outperformance was price versus volume? And then maybe you can tell us what you're expecting in terms of ES segment growth specifically for 2023.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, it was a mix of both price and volume, but more pricing to come, right? We've taken a lot of pricing action, but we still have some contracted portion of that business and fully seen that. So, you're seeing both the cross-sell that we talked about, and you're seeing the pricing hit with really strong performance. And the plans for 2023, that business is performing ahead of our plan, more broadly both the US Ecology acquisition and the broader ES space, I think, is going to be a very positive contributor.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, if you think about -- Noah, I was just going to add. A good portion of the growth, right, that you're going to see year-over-year is coming vis-\u00e0-vis the acquisition rollover. But if you think about total contribution from an organic perspective, right, we're expecting 50 basis points on total revenue. So, that's about, call it, $70 million, and that would be just at the point when US Ecology anniversaries forward. So, that's still kind of a high single-digit type organic growth.\nNoah Kaye: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then since you mentioned the synergies were tracking ahead of plan, can you quantify that for us? And I guess, any chance you could give us an updated cost synergies number as to where you think this will get to within the timeframe?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, just to give you an idea, when we actually provided the guidance when we closed the deal, we said we thought we'd get about $5 million worth of synergies in 2022. We actually got closer to $13 million, $14 million. So, you can see nice outperformance there. And a lot of that was just actually getting the integration activities done quicker than we originally anticipated.\nJon Vander Ark: And we said total synergies would be $40 million, cost synergy would be $40 million. I think that number wound up closer to $50 million.\nNoah Kaye: Perfect. I'll give it back. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. I want to just focus on the M&A there in the $500 million guide. What drives your target for $500 million? Is that on a leverage basis that you'd like to keep yourselves close to? Or is it more just your best guess as to what kind of deals in your -- in the target areas that you want to do are available in 2023?\nJon Vander Ark: I'd say it is based on a passionate view about intrinsic value, right, and driving intrinsic value over time and conservatism, right? So, we never want to put out a number that people go and they have to hit, and therefore, we start chasing deals. So, I want the team to feel comfortable at any point in time passing on a given deal because it doesn't mean a return criteria or there's a set of terms or business conditions or practices that we're not going to want to be owners of over time. And so I think we've always put out a number over the last three or four years, I think you've seen a pretty steady beat against that number. My expectations for the team, I think, are slightly higher than that. But we always want, again, put out a conservative numbers the team feels no pressure to reach.\nWalter Spracklin: And has there been any shift in valuations, be it with higher interest rates, be it with more deals having been done? Is there more difficulty? Is there -- has valuations come off? Has availability changed? In other words, the pipeline that you look at going into 2023, is it very much different than what you saw in 2022, excluding obviously, US Ecology?\nJon Vander Ark: No, pipeline is very strong. We've got a mix of small- and medium-sized deals across Recycling and Solid Waste and ES, right, and that's kind of at different stages in the process and feel good about that. The premiums or the multiples are still kind of hanging in the same ZIP Code because we're looking at premium assets. We're not just buying revenue. We're very particular buyers, and we want to get something that's quality. And one of the first questions one has asked is why would we do this ourselves? And if it's something like a residential subscription business or a temporary roll-off business, we should go get that with our sales team, not pay a premium for that. So, we're looking for infrastructure. We're looking for route-based businesses with customer contracts that we know that we will integrate in the business and drive value over time.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. And just the last one here. Just on your guidance, I know you had, had a double-digit in there. You kind of walked it back last quarter. You've kind of brought it back again confidently here this quarter. Just what's changed your view here that gives you the confidence behind this guide, that you perhaps kind of didn't have when you had the third quarter report?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, maybe a slightly different view of the history, right? We never gave an official guidance. We said we had line of sight at one point to double-digit, right? That was in a different commodity price environment. And so given the commodity market being depressed for six to nine months, that certainly gave us a different outlook, right, just based on the math of the commodity prices. And I think we've talked about here a high single-digit number going forward. Now, if we end up doing more M&A early in the year and that has the year impact and we get to double-digits, we certainly could, but I think we've been pretty consistent with how we've approached it.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And the other thing I would just add to that as well is that on the October call, we said that we've got a perspective that we're going to achieve high single-digit growth. And if you look at the midpoint of everything we put out there, it's high single-digit growth. So, to Jon's point, I would sit there and say it is exactly in line with where we thought we would be in October.\nWalter Spracklin: Fair enough. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. I wanted to ask first on capital expenditures. I know 4Q is usually sometimes seasonally high, and this quarter seemed maybe particularly high. I was wondering if that was related to the asset management system in the polymer centers, or if there was something else in there. And how we should be thinking about CapEx for 2023?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, certainly investing to grow the business, right? We're always disciplined but never afraid to spend that money. One of the bigger drivers of that was the second polymer center that we're putting in the Midwest. We just -- we've seen so much demand for the offtake of our first one that gives us a lot of confidence that the market is really getting value and need that product. And the returns in our business case, we think, are going to be north of what we originally pro forma-ed. So, that gave us the confidence to accelerate that investment moving forward.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, and the other thing is, we talked that there were some supply chain disruptions throughout the year, impacted things like trucks and some of the heavy equipment. And we actually were able to take or seed, take title of those assets in the fourth quarter. So, as you think about building the 2023 plan, most likely, we'll be more back-end loaded like you've seen in the last couple of years, but maybe not to the extent that you saw in 2022.\nToni Kaplan: Super helpful. And I wanted to ask on volumes. I know you gave the 50 to 100 basis points for 2023 of volume. I wanted to just ask sort of what you're seeing with regard to commercial and industrial. I know some of your competitors talked about like a little bit of a softness in 4Q, but maybe a little bit better in January. I wanted to hear your experience on that.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, there's different moving pieces for sure. Obviously, there's been a little bit of a slowdown in the construction market as you've seen housing starts kind of pull back in the second half of last year, and we've certainly baked in some softening of that into the 2023 environment. But listen, the industrial market is very, very strong right now, right? You saw the consumer number this morning. I mean the consumer is engaged. So, we still see lots of economic activity. Travel and leisure, right, is kind of bursting at the seams. So, we remain mindful, right, that there's certainly recession talks on the environment, but we're a pretty broad-based barometer of the economy, and we're seeing a lot of strength right now.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And even though we're seeing a little bit of softness on some of the construction activity, we're still seeing above-average price. If you take a look in the temporary large container business, we're nearly 9%priced during the fourth quarter.\nToni Kaplan: Sure. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chiang of CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Thank you operator and good afternoon everybody. I was just wondering, when you talk about the pricing initiatives within ES, just wondering what percentage of your revenue do you think you need to reprice to get to the levels you wanted? And how long do you think it takes to kind of get through all of that?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, we'll look at every dollar of revenue on every customer and really try to understand -- again, we look at pricing with two lens. One is, from a customer and an insight standpoint, right, what does the market bear? What does our offer have from a value standpoint versus our competitors? And then we also want to look on the internal side and say, what is our cost? We're including a capital charge and make sure that we're getting a fair return on that. And so we're going to go systematically through every customer and every dollar of revenue. And I think the encouraging thing is we put out some double-digit price increases, and we're seeing it stick, right? Customers are really valuing the integrated offering. And keep in mind, whatever they spend with us is a very small percentage of their cost structure. And so safety and speed and sustainability and our digital tools and all those things that we're investing in, right, those are big differentiators that allow that price to stick.\nKevin Chiang: All right. That makes a ton of sense. And then I apologize if you've given this number before, but when you look out longer term and you're through some of the cost synergies and some of the revenue upside opportunities, do you have a targeted ES adjusted EBITDA margin that you're thinking about? You did 17.5%in -- or roughly 17.5% in 2022. Does this get to the mid-20s when you're kind of through many of these initiatives?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I think what we're -- listen, over time, long-term, I think these businesses converge in terms of returns. I think you'll get free cash flow conversion to get there first because this is a slightly different OpEx-CapEx trade-off in this part of the business. And then over time, I think -- for a longer period of time, I think getting the margin to converge, I don't think is out of sight or out of reach as well. Now, that's not going to happen overnight, right? We are going to kind of ratably, right, systematically take this up. So, I think the goal in the next four or five years to get that in the mid-20s is very reachable.\nKevin Chiang: Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hi, thank you very much Jon and Brian, Aaron for taking the questions. Brian are we at about a $1.6 billion run rate in ES revenues when I roll in the M&A? And then what does that$1.6 billion grow organically? I just trying to put all the pieces together from your transcript, and I think I have myself a little confused.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: We're probably closer, Michael, to -- in the $1.5 billion range, a little over $1.5 billion. But organically, like I said earlier, we're thinking that's a 7% to 8% organic type grower here in the near term, and with opportunities for even some of the additional cross-sell opportunities to be additive to that.\nMichael Hoffman: So -- okay. So, the following that then, in your margin for the whole year, 29.2%, what do you think the Solid Waste business and the Environmental Services business do individually to merge together?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: So, in the Recycling and Solid Waste business, we're expecting overall about 30 basis points of margin expansion, right? And in that business, we have to overcome the 30 basis point headwind from commodity prices. So, the underlying business is growing kind of 60 to 70 basis points. Now, in the Environmental Solutions business, we're expecting 100 basis points of margin improvement, and there is the acquisition roll over of US Ecology, which is kind of a negative 70 on that portion when you compare it to what we had in the Gulf. So, we're expecting margin expansion in the underlying business thereof 170 basis points. The reason why that only comes to 10 basis points overall is we just have a greater mix or a greater percentage of ES business in 2023 than we did in 2022.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Yes, I get that. And then can you bridge for us the $1.724 billion of free cash in 2022 to get to the midpoint of your guide? What is the cash interest, the cash tax, the incentive comp above plan? And then I'm assuming everything else is made up by organic growth productivity.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Yes, let me give you a couple of pieces of that, certainly. So, interest -- and I'm going to give you some pre-tax numbers. And for argument's sake, you can just sit there and take, call it, 70% of it. You do the after-tax. But interest up $90 million, right? So, that's an increased outflow there. Incentive comp is about a $35 million outflow compared to target levels. And then bonus depreciation, you wouldn't tax effect the impact of bonus depreciation, but that's about a $35 million increase in cash taxes.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then--\nBrian DelGhiaccio: So, when you take all those pieces, that creates -- now I'm going to kind of flip a little bit to conversion, and that creates, call it, about a 300 basis point headwind to conversion, all of which being offset by just the EBITDA growth in the business as well as some benefits in working capital, some of those benefits being unlocked. We talked about finishing the finance and procurement modules during 2022, and we think that there's an opportunity, in particular, on the DPO side to drive improvements in working capital.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then just squeezing one in, sorry. The $125 per ton, how much of that has to rely on OCC moving? And what would your target be for OCC to make the $125 in your guide?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Well, I mean, just to put it in perspective, right, OCC, fiber, right, represents about 70% of our basket of goods, right? So, most of this, we are expecting to come more on the OCC side. But even just to put it into --all of it into perspective, if you take a look at what we're expecting from a guide perspective compared to current prices, it's a relatively modest recovery, right? That's $30 million worth of EBITDA and about 20 basis points to margin, $20 million of free cash flow, if things were to stay at current levels.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Good afternoon and good evening everyone. Brian, if we just go back to your margin cadence discussion, the headwinds in the first quarter, really, the first half, that implies we're going to be exiting the fourth quarter of 2023 with margins up something like 150 basis points year-over-year heading into 2024. So, I'm wondering, are we setting up for 2024 to be an outsized margin expansion year because we're essentially making up for a lost year from a commodity price impact in 2023? Anything that you'd add to that bridge as we think about what the margin progression might look like.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Sure. And a couple of things, Jerry. I mean, you've got two variables, right, when you take a look at that. You have the -- what we're expecting in 2023, but also what happened in 2022, right? So, we're expecting commodity prices in 2023 to be at the highest point of the year. They were at the lowest point in 2022, so you can't just go to the margin expansion. But yes, exiting the year in 2024, we think it's going to be kind of a nice jump-off point heading into 2024. But I wouldn't just look at the overall margin expansion because you've got two years in your math there that you got to take into consideration.\nJerry Revich: Sure. But you're going to have the same comp benefit in the first half of 2024, hopefully. And if we think about the profitability of the recycling business in the fourth quarter with this ultra-low recycled cardboard prices. Can you just update us on what was the margin profile of the business, roughly, just so we can get a feel for where it's troughing in the cycle, given all the work you've done there?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: You're talking about on the recycling side of the business?\nJerry Revich: Yes.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: It's still a profitable business at these levels and still an attractive return. So, again, we would expect -- through the cycle, we talked about we expect these depressed prices to be somewhat transitory and, again, return closer in line to a 10-year average. Not even back to the levels it was when it was over $200 a ton on our basket of goods.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I ask around the gas part of the business? Nice little bonus we got from the EPA in terms of eRINs. How much gas to electric power do you folks generate in terms of your share of the power that you generate? And what's your take on what's a reasonable value capture opportunity for you and your peers?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Of our existing projects, the vast majority are gas electricity. Now the -- where RINs have gone, all of the new projects in the pipeline were contemplated to be gas powered and/or methane RNG. The great news with our partnership with BP, we've got option value, right? eRINs coming online. And we're both very open-minded to understanding where those markets move and the local geography and even places where we make power on fleet to figure out whether we want to convert some of those opportunities rather than RNG to go to electricity as well. But we see it as, over time, a benefit for us because it will have two pathways.\nJerry Revich: I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you very much. My question is regarding residential volumes that have inched up here in the last couple of quarters. Is that a trend you expect to continue this year? And when you look at that 1% overall midpoint volume outlook, does that contemplate commercial container volumes being flat or negative at any point in 2023?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: No, I mean what you're seeing mostly on the residential is some relatively larger contracts. You're seeing that in the numbers. So that's expected to anniversary in 2023. So, we don't expect that to continue throughout the year. And yes, when you take a look at our volume cadence, we expect that small container will remain positive, right, throughout 2023. When you take a look at overall volumes, we think to have our highest volume performance early in the year. And again, that's a step down throughout but remaining positive in all 4 quarters.\nJon Vander Ark: I'd say residential, that's been, I'd say, over the last decade, the most disappointing part of the business in terms of where margin and return has gone and that hasn't expanded at the same rate as the other businesses. There's a lot of reasons for that, with commodity prices and inflation and everything else. But listen, we don't do work for free, right? We put upward pressure, right, on all those contracts and look at those contracts just like we were an acquisition, right? We're going to put capital into it and what type of return do we get against that. And if we can't meet our return thresholds on that, we won't do the work.\nDavid Manthey: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKyle White: Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious what you're seeing on open market pricing heading into 2023 as inflation starts to come down and maybe there's a bit more uncertainty regarding economy and volumes going forward. Are you seeing any change in behavior from maybe some of the smaller competitors in this environment relative to last year?\nJon Vander Ark: No, last year, we put out the highest level of pricing we ever have in small container in the open market, and we had the highest percentage of retention of that price that we've ever had in our history, which is really a staggering number. I think it speaks to, right, the value of our service that we're providing. It also speaks to the broader context with everything else in plating. Those numbers were quite consistent across the quarters, right, in terms of our ability to retain price, right? And we're seeing strength here in the early part of the year on that. So, we're mindful of the environment. But look, at all of these smaller competitors, right, they have truck costs that are going up. They need to buy new equipment after some supply chain challenges, right? They have labor costs that are going up. So, they need the price to cover their costs, which I think is support of a broader pricing environment.\nKyle White: Yes, that makes sense. And then on leverage, how are you thinking about leverage in this environment? What's sort of the right target for you before investors should expect meaningful capital return through buybacks?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, we've talked about kind of that sweet spot for us being right around three times. We're a little bit over that right now, but we expect to be there in the next, call it, six months, at which point then we would look to kind of return to that normal level of looking at the repurchases and so on and so forth.\nKyle White: Sounds good. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I certainly appreciate the level of details of your 2023 expectations. I think a lot of puts and takes in this environment. So it might be helpful if you could just outline the areas where you kind of see the greatest source of upside, inflation moderating, some tech investments. And then on the flip side, where you see the greatest risk to maybe hitting these targets as well? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, from an upside perspective, and we mentioned this earlier, is that we are expecting inflation to remain persistent throughout 2023. And so again, Jon just talked about the fact that we're pricing at higher levels in 2023 -- early in 2023 than we did even in 2022 because we expect inflation to remain sticky. So if that does come down, that is certainly an opportunity in order to sit there and to drive better performance than we anticipated. But you do have to remember, some of that inflation on wages, and wages typically go in annually. So, once you put that wage out in the marketplace, you're not pulling that back. So, there is some stickiness to the inflation, but certainly, as it relates to some third-party costs, some of the maintenance-related expenses, transportation expenses. If those come in, that would certainly be a source of upside.\nStephanie Moore: Great. And then on the downside?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Sorry. We just talked a little bit about recycled commodity prices. Again, we've expected a recovery, but we've also dimensionalized it for you so you realize it's a relatively modest recovery that we're expecting. But if they stay at current levels, that would be a little bit of some downside relative to our expectations.\nJon Vander Ark: And I just said the broader macro environment, obviously, we've been through a pandemic and war at the doorstep of Europe and China virtually shutting down and supply chain challenges and inflation. So, I think we're prepared for uncertainty in a dynamic environment. Again, we're running the business, not just for the quarter or the year, we're running it through the cycle and making decisions accordingly. But we're mindful that we may have to adjust or adapt the business if do things emerge.\nStephanie Moore: Absolutely. And then just on the second polymer center going up, starting to go up this year. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the initial KPIs or returns you're seeing from -- or expect to see just given the demand from your first center and kind of what drove you to decide to open up the second here.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, across, we think we're going to have at least 4 centers across the U.S. We think when they all get up and running at scale, it's kind of a $250 million incremental revenue business for us. We think the EBITDA margins are going to be certainly north of 30%, right? Very attractive IRRs on those investments, and I think we're going to beat that pro forma, right? And we know from the conversations we've had and the pricing that we're getting right now, we're starting to take orders, obviously, for the center in Las Vegas. I'm very confident we're going to beat those numbers in the pro forma.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Feniger: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I understand that you guys have been pricing ahead of cost, and there's been a lot more discipline in the industry. But is there like a step function change in terms of how Republic is pricing from a few years ago? I mean, you guys went through some years of intentional shedding some business. I'm just wondering if the quality of the business now, you feel that you can have a wider price versus cost spread than maybe the Republic Services a few years ago?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I think it's a good question, Michael. Certainly, and you highlighted it. Certainly, customer mix is a hidden element or hidden factor in being able to get price. And we went through some intentional shedding, right, which has negative drag on our volume for a few quarters when you look a few years back. The quality of our revenue is much higher than it was historically, and we feel good about that. And that's all the way across from national accounts to small container to getting out the last remain broker work out of the system to municipal and getting a fair escalator into those contracts. So, I think the overall health of our pricing across the portfolio, well, not perfect, of course, but it's much, much better than it was a few years ago. And then you combine that with the capture and the tools that we have to really start to grind out a few extra bps here and there across our 13 million customers, who have understanding and willingness to pay. And then on the other side of that, with the RISE platform, driving productivity and changing our cost position in the business. So, when you've got a healthier customer mix, right, and better ability to price with a cost structure that I think is healthy and getting healthier. I think that does create the context for continued margin expansion over time.\nMichael Feniger: Great. And Brian, you touched on it with the question earlier, but just to dig a little deeper. Can you actually talk about the cost inflation, how that kind of trended through the fourth quarter and what you're seeing in early 2023? What you guys are kind of embedding there? Because I think you're saying you're not really embedding a rollover there. Just curious what you actually saw through the quarter in early 2023 that we'll kind of expect or what you guys are at least embedding in the guidance there? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, if you think about for the full year for 2023, we're in that, call it, 5% to 5.5% inflation-type range. And again, when you take a look at the 6.5% expected yield on related revenue, that's how we're driving that 80 basis points or so of expansion in the underlying business. That's about the level we saw exiting the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain relatively consistent throughout 2023.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Andrea. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their efforts that enabled our strong 2022 results. The success of our strategic investments is made possible due to their hard work and commitment to serving our customers. Have a good evening and be safe.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year, delivering results that exceeded our full year guidance, even in the face of increased volatility in the broader marketplace. During 2022, we achieved revenue growth of 20%, including a 10% from acquisitions; delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 16%; generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.93, which is an 18% increase over the prior year; and produced $1.74 billion of adjusted free cash flow, a 15% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $2.7 billion in acquisitions in 2022, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is going well, with cost synergies tracking ahead of plan. Revenue contribution from US Ecology outperformed our expectations by nearly $50 million for the year, with almost all of the overperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. We continue to adjust prices related to US Ecology and our broader Environmental Solutions business to better align with the capital invested and resources deployed. Pricing actions taken to date have been successful as our customers recognize the high value of service we provide. Additionally, we are building momentum cross-selling our complete set of products and services, with approximately $40 million in new sales to date. Aside from US Ecology, we invested $500 million in value-creating acquisitions during the year. All of these deals were in the recycling and solid waste space. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Regarding Customer Zeal, we continue to enhance our culture of delivering a world-class customer experience to win new business and drive customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at 94%, and we exited 2022 with our highest NPS scores of the year. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter, with simultaneous growth in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue increased to 8.4% and average yield on related revenue increased to 6.7%. This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Organic volume growth was 1.5%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Moving to digital. In early 2022, we implemented the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which streamline back-office activities and provide our local leaders with enhanced data. Currently, we are building our new asset management system, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and drive better warranty recovery. We expect to implement the new asset management system beginning in 2024. We continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. We finished the implementation for all large container and small container routes during 2022 and completed 37% of residential routes by the end of the year. The remaining residential routes are scheduled to be complete by mid-2023. This is a key component enabling further connectivity with our customers, including real-time service notification. The adoption of RISE has helped drive operational efficiencies and cost savings worth approximately $50 million annually. Sustainability is core to our strategy and one of our differentiating capabilities. We believe Republic Services is in a unique position to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth, while making a positive impact on the environment. For example, our polymer centers are advancing circularity of plastics. This is the first time a single U.S. company will manage the plastic stream from current site collection to delivery of high-quality recycled content for consumer packaging. Development of the first center in Las Vegas is on track and is slated to come online in late 2023. Development of our second polymer center is already underway. This facility will be located in the Midwest and will serve as a hub for aggregating and processing recovered plastics in the region. This center should come online in late 2024. The investments we are making to develop these polymer centers is being absorbed through our normal capital expenditure process. Additionally, the development of our renewable natural gas projects is progressing well. All 57 of these projects are being co-developed with partners, with the majority structured as a joint venture. We expect 4 of these projects to come online by mid-2023. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be a workplace where the best people from all backgrounds come to work. Employee engagement improved to a score of 85, with 97% participation. Turnover rates in the fourth quarter improved to the lowest level we've experienced in nearly two years. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the seventh consecutive year. Our 2022 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and strengthens the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. Looking forward, we expect to deliver high single-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2023, even with the headwinds from lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates. More specifically, we expect 2022 revenues in a range of $14.65 billion to $14.8 billion. This represents high single-digit growth compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. This represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.15 to $5.23 and generate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion. Our acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity in both Recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in2023. Our 2023 financial guidance includes a rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2022. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year. Hey, Tyler. Yes, it was a mix of both price and volume, but more pricing to come, right? We've taken a lot of pricing action, but we still have some contracted portion of that business and fully seen that. So, you're seeing both the cross-sell that we talked about, and you're seeing the pricing hit with really strong performance. And the plans for 2023, that business is performing ahead of our plan, more broadly both the US Ecology acquisition and the broader ES space, I think, is going to be a very positive contributor. And we said total synergies would be $40 million, cost synergy would be $40 million. I think that number wound up closer to $50 million. I'd say it is based on a passionate view about intrinsic value, right, and driving intrinsic value over time and conservatism, right? So, we never want to put out a number that people go and they have to hit, and therefore, we start chasing deals. So, I want the team to feel comfortable at any point in time passing on a given deal because it doesn't mean a return criteria or there's a set of terms or business conditions or practices that we're not going to want to be owners of over time. And so I think we've always put out a number over the last three or four years, I think you've seen a pretty steady beat against that number. My expectations for the team, I think, are slightly higher than that. But we always want, again, put out a conservative numbers the team feels no pressure to reach. No, pipeline is very strong. We've got a mix of small- and medium-sized deals across Recycling and Solid Waste and ES, right, and that's kind of at different stages in the process and feel good about that. The premiums or the multiples are still kind of hanging in the same ZIP Code because we're looking at premium assets. We're not just buying revenue. We're very particular buyers, and we want to get something that's quality. And one of the first questions one has asked is why would we do this ourselves? And if it's something like a residential subscription business or a temporary roll-off business, we should go get that with our sales team, not pay a premium for that. So, we're looking for infrastructure. We're looking for route-based businesses with customer contracts that we know that we will integrate in the business and drive value over time. Well, maybe a slightly different view of the history, right? We never gave an official guidance. We said we had line of sight at one point to double-digit, right? That was in a different commodity price environment. And so given the commodity market being depressed for six to nine months, that certainly gave us a different outlook, right, just based on the math of the commodity prices. And I think we've talked about here a high single-digit number going forward. Now, if we end up doing more M&A early in the year and that has the year impact and we get to double-digits, we certainly could, but I think we've been pretty consistent with how we've approached it. Yes, certainly investing to grow the business, right? We're always disciplined but never afraid to spend that money. One of the bigger drivers of that was the second polymer center that we're putting in the Midwest. We just -- we've seen so much demand for the offtake of our first one that gives us a lot of confidence that the market is really getting value and need that product. And the returns in our business case, we think, are going to be north of what we originally pro forma-ed. So, that gave us the confidence to accelerate that investment moving forward. Yes, there's different moving pieces for sure. Obviously, there's been a little bit of a slowdown in the construction market as you've seen housing starts kind of pull back in the second half of last year, and we've certainly baked in some softening of that into the 2023 environment. But listen, the industrial market is very, very strong right now, right? You saw the consumer number this morning. I mean the consumer is engaged. So, we still see lots of economic activity. Travel and leisure, right, is kind of bursting at the seams. So, we remain mindful, right, that there's certainly recession talks on the environment, but we're a pretty broad-based barometer of the economy, and we're seeing a lot of strength right now. Well, we'll look at every dollar of revenue on every customer and really try to understand -- again, we look at pricing with two lens. One is, from a customer and an insight standpoint, right, what does the market bear? What does our offer have from a value standpoint versus our competitors? And then we also want to look on the internal side and say, what is our cost? We're including a capital charge and make sure that we're getting a fair return on that. And so we're going to go systematically through every customer and every dollar of revenue. And I think the encouraging thing is we put out some double-digit price increases, and we're seeing it stick, right? Customers are really valuing the integrated offering. And keep in mind, whatever they spend with us is a very small percentage of their cost structure. And so safety and speed and sustainability and our digital tools and all those things that we're investing in, right, those are big differentiators that allow that price to stick. Yes, I think what we're -- listen, over time, long-term, I think these businesses converge in terms of returns. I think you'll get free cash flow conversion to get there first because this is a slightly different OpEx-CapEx trade-off in this part of the business. And then over time, I think -- for a longer period of time, I think getting the margin to converge, I don't think is out of sight or out of reach as well. Now, that's not going to happen overnight, right? We are going to kind of ratably, right, systematically take this up. So, I think the goal in the next four or five years to get that in the mid-20s is very reachable. I'd say residential, that's been, I'd say, over the last decade, the most disappointing part of the business in terms of where margin and return has gone and that hasn't expanded at the same rate as the other businesses. There's a lot of reasons for that, with commodity prices and inflation and everything else. But listen, we don't do work for free, right? We put upward pressure, right, on all those contracts and look at those contracts just like we were an acquisition, right? We're going to put capital into it and what type of return do we get against that. And if we can't meet our return thresholds on that, we won't do the work. No, last year, we put out the highest level of pricing we ever have in small container in the open market, and we had the highest percentage of retention of that price that we've ever had in our history, which is really a staggering number. I think it speaks to, right, the value of our service that we're providing. It also speaks to the broader context with everything else in plating. Those numbers were quite consistent across the quarters, right, in terms of our ability to retain price, right? And we're seeing strength here in the early part of the year on that. So, we're mindful of the environment. But look, at all of these smaller competitors, right, they have truck costs that are going up. They need to buy new equipment after some supply chain challenges, right? They have labor costs that are going up. So, they need the price to cover their costs, which I think is support of a broader pricing environment. And I just said the broader macro environment, obviously, we've been through a pandemic and war at the doorstep of Europe and China virtually shutting down and supply chain challenges and inflation. So, I think we're prepared for uncertainty in a dynamic environment. Again, we're running the business, not just for the quarter or the year, we're running it through the cycle and making decisions accordingly. But we're mindful that we may have to adjust or adapt the business if do things emerge. Yes, across, we think we're going to have at least 4 centers across the U.S. We think when they all get up and running at scale, it's kind of a $250 million incremental revenue business for us. We think the EBITDA margins are going to be certainly north of 30%, right? Very attractive IRRs on those investments, and I think we're going to beat that pro forma, right? And we know from the conversations we've had and the pricing that we're getting right now, we're starting to take orders, obviously, for the center in Las Vegas. I'm very confident we're going to beat those numbers in the pro forma. Yes, I think it's a good question, Michael. Certainly, and you highlighted it. Certainly, customer mix is a hidden element or hidden factor in being able to get price. And we went through some intentional shedding, right, which has negative drag on our volume for a few quarters when you look a few years back. The quality of our revenue is much higher than it was historically, and we feel good about that. And that's all the way across from national accounts to small container to getting out the last remain broker work out of the system to municipal and getting a fair escalator into those contracts. So, I think the overall health of our pricing across the portfolio, well, not perfect, of course, but it's much, much better than it was a few years ago.

So, when you've got a healthier customer mix, right, and better ability to price with a cost structure that I think is healthy and getting healthier. I think that does create the context for continued margin expansion over time. Thank you, Andrea. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their efforts that enabled our strong 2022 results.

            "content": "Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.4%, which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.1%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 8.6%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9%. Average yield on related revenue was 6.7%, an increase of 40 basis points when compared to our third quarter performance. In 2023, we expect average yield on total revenue of approximately 5.5%. We expect average yield on related revenue of approximately 6.5%. This is an increase of 80 basis points over our full year 2022 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 1.5%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 1.6%, an increase in large container of 60 basis points, an increase in residential of 1.2% and an increase in landfill of 3.9%. For 2023, we expect organic volume growth in a range of 50 basis points to 1%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $88 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 180 basis points during the quarter. 2022 full year commodity prices were $170 per ton. This compared to $187 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. We believe that current commodity prices are temporarily depressed due to a global supply/demand imbalance and that prices will recover in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are assuming average recycled commodity prices of $125 per ton in 2023, with prices starting at $95 per ton in the first quarter and steadily increasing throughout the year. At $125 per ton, this would result in a decrease in full year 2023 revenue and EBITDA of $45 million when compared to the prior year and a 30 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. In the first quarter of 2023, this would result in a year-on-year decrease of nearly $30 million in revenue and EBITDA and a 70 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased approximately $320 million over the prior year, which primarily related to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.3%. This compares to 28.1% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which included 100 basis points related to US Ecology, and an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 20 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 28.7%. This compares to 28.6% margin in the prior year or 10 basis points of margin expansion. Margins improved in the Recycling and Solid Waste business even with an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 10.9% of revenue. This included 40 basis points from additional incentive compensation expense due to full year financial outperformance. Full year SG&A expenses were 10.2% of revenue. This was favorable 20 basis points compared to the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. In 2023, we expect EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.2%. The 10 basis points of expected margin expansion include a 40 basis point decline related to acquisitions, primarily related to US Ecology, and a 30 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These headwinds are more than offset by margin expansion in the underlying business of 80 basis points. While we expect full year expansion compared to the prior year, margins are expected to be down in the first half due to the impact of acquisition rollover and recycled commodity prices. This is most notable in the first quarter where these headwinds impact margin by a combined 210 basis points. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was 10.7% of revenue in 2022 and is expected to be relatively consistent at 10.8% of revenue in 2023. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. For 2023, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion or approximately 8% growth at the midpoint. We believe this level of performance is very strong given the expected impact from lower recycled commodity prices, higher interest rates, and higher cash taxes as bonus depreciation begins to unwind. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.9 billion, and total liquidity was $1.7 billion. Floating debt interest rates consistently increased throughout 2022, and we now expect net interest expense of approximately$480 million in 2023. This is an increase of approximately $90 million compared to the prior year. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in approximately $33 million of additional interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was approximately 3.1 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage by mid-2023. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.1% during the fourth quarter and 25.1% for the full year. This lower than anticipated tax rate resulted in a $0.06 benefit to our full year 2022 EPS. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2023, made up of an adjusted effective tax rate of 20% and approximately $170 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Finally, we expect a majority of the EPS growth in 2023 to be back-end loaded. This results from having the toughest prior year comparisons on recycled commodity prices, interest rates, and taxes during the first half of the year. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. No, we would actually expect the restricted pricing to increase from the levels of where it is in the fourth quarter. So, again, on related revenue, it was 5.1% restricted in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to improve 50 to 100 basis points in 2023. But we do expect the level of pricing to be driven by the open market, similar to what you've seen in 2022 and, for that matter, the prior years as well. Yes. Listen, I guess you're talking about then on total revenue, so I'll give you that piece. So, yes, it starts highest -- actually, our high watermark is in the first quarter based on our expectations. And then it sequentially declines from there, but we're expecting that pricing remains above 5% in all quarters. Yes. So, I'll answer your second question first. That is correct. We have not included that. So, what is included are deals that closed by the end of the year. It's $440 million worth of revenue or 300 basis points of growth, that's the rollover, and most of that being US Ecology. Yes. So, if you think about -- Noah, I was just going to add. A good portion of the growth, right, that you're going to see year-over-year is coming vis-a\u0300-vis the acquisition rollover. But if you think about total contribution from an organic perspective, right, we're expecting 50 basis points on total revenue. So, that's about, call it, $70 million, and that would be just at the point when US Ecology anniversaries forward. So, that's still kind of a high single-digit type organic growth. Yes. So, just to give you an idea, when we actually provided the guidance when we closed the deal, we said we thought we'd get about $5 million worth of synergies in 2022. We actually got closer to $13 million, $14 million. So, you can see nice outperformance there. And a lot of that was just actually getting the integration activities done quicker than we originally anticipated. And the other thing I would just add to that as well is that on the October call, we said that we've got a perspective that we're going to achieve high single-digit growth. And if you look at the midpoint of everything we put out there, it's high single-digit growth. So, to Jon's point, I would sit there and say it is exactly in line with where we thought we would be in October. Yes, and the other thing is, we talked that there were some supply chain disruptions throughout the year, impacted things like trucks and some of the heavy equipment. And we actually were able to take or seed, take title of those assets in the fourth quarter. So, as you think about building the 2023 plan, most likely, we'll be more back-end loaded like you've seen in the last couple of years, but maybe not to the extent that you saw in 2022. Yes. And even though we're seeing a little bit of softness on some of the construction activity, we're still seeing above-average price. If you take a look in the temporary large container business, we're nearly 9%priced during the fourth quarter. We're probably closer, Michael, to -- in the $1.5 billion range, a little over $1.5 billion. But organically, like I said earlier, we're thinking that's a 7% to 8% organic type grower here in the near term, and with opportunities for even some of the additional cross-sell opportunities to be additive to that. So, in the Recycling and Solid Waste business, we're expecting overall about 30 basis points of margin expansion, right? And in that business, we have to overcome the 30 basis point headwind from commodity prices. So, the underlying business is growing kind of 60 to 70 basis points. Now, in the Environmental Solutions business, we're expecting 100 basis points of margin improvement, and there is the acquisition roll over of US Ecology, which is kind of a negative 70 on that portion when you compare it to what we had in the Gulf. So, we're expecting margin expansion in the underlying business thereof 170 basis points. The reason why that only comes to 10 basis points overall is we just have a greater mix or a greater percentage of ES business in 2023 than we did in 2022. Yes. Yes, let me give you a couple of pieces of that, certainly. So, interest -- and I'm going to give you some pre-tax numbers. And for argument's sake, you can just sit there and take, call it, 70% of it. You do the after-tax. But interest up $90 million, right? So, that's an increased outflow there. Incentive comp is about a $35 million outflow compared to target levels. And then bonus depreciation, you wouldn't tax effect the impact of bonus depreciation, but that's about a $35 million increase in cash taxes. So, when you take all those pieces, that creates -- now I'm going to kind of flip a little bit to conversion, and that creates, call it, about a 300 basis point headwind to conversion, all of which being offset by just the EBITDA growth in the business as well as some benefits in working capital, some of those benefits being unlocked. We talked about finishing the finance and procurement modules during 2022, and we think that there's an opportunity, in particular, on the DPO side to drive improvements in working capital. Well, I mean, just to put it in perspective, right, OCC, fiber, right, represents about 70% of our basket of goods, right? So, most of this, we are expecting to come more on the OCC side. But even just to put it into --all of it into perspective, if you take a look at what we're expecting from a guide perspective compared to current prices, it's a relatively modest recovery, right? That's $30 million worth of EBITDA and about 20 basis points to margin, $20 million of free cash flow, if things were to stay at current levels. Sure. And a couple of things, Jerry. I mean, you've got two variables, right, when you take a look at that. You have the -- what we're expecting in 2023, but also what happened in 2022, right? So, we're expecting commodity prices in 2023 to be at the highest point of the year. They were at the lowest point in 2022, so you can't just go to the margin expansion. But yes, exiting the year in 2024, we think it's going to be kind of a nice jump-off point heading into 2024. But I wouldn't just look at the overall margin expansion because you've got two years in your math there that you got to take into consideration. You're talking about on the recycling side of the business? It's still a profitable business at these levels and still an attractive return. So, again, we would expect -- through the cycle, we talked about we expect these depressed prices to be somewhat transitory and, again, return closer in line to a 10-year average. Not even back to the levels it was when it was over $200 a ton on our basket of goods. Yes. Of our existing projects, the vast majority are gas electricity. Now the -- where RINs have gone, all of the new projects in the pipeline were contemplated to be gas powered and/or methane RNG. The great news with our partnership with BP, we've got option value, right? eRINs coming online. And we're both very open-minded to understanding where those markets move and the local geography and even places where we make power on fleet to figure out whether we want to convert some of those opportunities rather than RNG to go to electricity as well. But we see it as, over time, a benefit for us because it will have two pathways. No, I mean what you're seeing mostly on the residential is some relatively larger contracts. You're seeing that in the numbers. So that's expected to anniversary in 2023. So, we don't expect that to continue throughout the year. And yes, when you take a look at our volume cadence, we expect that small container will remain positive, right, throughout 2023. When you take a look at overall volumes, we think to have our highest volume performance early in the year. And again, that's a step down throughout but remaining positive in all 4 quarters. Yes, we've talked about kind of that sweet spot for us being right around three times. We're a little bit over that right now, but we expect to be there in the next, call it, six months, at which point then we would look to kind of return to that normal level of looking at the repurchases and so on and so forth. Yes, from an upside perspective, and we mentioned this earlier, is that we are expecting inflation to remain persistent throughout 2023. And so again, Jon just talked about the fact that we're pricing at higher levels in 2023 -- early in 2023 than we did even in 2022 because we expect inflation to remain sticky. So if that does come down, that is certainly an opportunity in order to sit there and to drive better performance than we anticipated. But you do have to remember, some of that inflation on wages, and wages typically go in annually. So, once you put that wage out in the marketplace, you're not pulling that back. So, there is some stickiness to the inflation, but certainly, as it relates to some third-party costs, some of the maintenance-related expenses, transportation expenses. If those come in, that would certainly be a source of upside. Sorry. We just talked a little bit about recycled commodity prices. Again, we've expected a recovery, but we've also dimensionalized it for you so you realize it's a relatively modest recovery that we're expecting. But if they stay at current levels, that would be a little bit of some downside relative to our expectations. Yes, if you think about for the full year for 2023, we're in that, call it, 5% to 5.5% inflation-type range. And again, when you take a look at the 6.5% expected yield on related revenue, that's how we're driving that 80 basis points or so of expansion in the underlying business. That's about the level we saw exiting the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain relatively consistent throughout 2023."

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our strong results in the third quarter demonstrate our ability to profitably grow the business and effectively manage our cost structure even with increased volatility in the broader marketplace. Cost pressures remain elevated and more persistent than we originally anticipated. In the face of those cost headwinds, we are leveraging our tools and technology to price ahead of cost inflation and drive margin expansion in the underlying business. From our perspective, customer demand remains strong and supportive of continued volume growth. The sound fundamentals in our business, together with a laser focus on the customer, position us well to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 23%, including over 12% from acquisitions; generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which is a 20% increase over the prior year; and produced more than $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 23% increase over the prior year. We remain confident that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the highest and best use of our cash flow. Year-to-date, we invested $2.6 billion of acquisitions, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is progressing as planned and we remain confident that we will achieve at least $40 million of cost synergies. Our initial pricing actions have been successful. We will continue to increase prices to ensure that all stages of the value chain earn an appropriate return. We are also gaining traction cross-selling our products and services, achieving over $25 million in new sales to-date. Apart from US Ecology, we have invested over $400 million of acquisitions this year. Substantially, all of these deals are in the recycling and solid waste space. Our robust acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity over the coming years. Year-to-date, we returned $640 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest for the future and advance our strategic initiatives to build distinctive capabilities in customers yield, digital and sustainability. With respect to customers yield, we delivered organic volume growth of 2.2% during the third quarter. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. We also demonstrated our ongoing ability to price in excess of underlying cost inflation. Floor price increased to 6.9% and average yield increased to 5.6%. This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Moving on to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools and improve the experience for both customers and employees. Our proprietary RISE tablets have been fully deployed across our large and small container route and deployment to residential route is 26% complete. The remaining residential routes are on track for completion by mid-2023. We have also launched Track My Truck. This technology connects the customer to their large and small container truck utilizing a GPS-enabled RISE tablet. This is a major milestone that serves as a foundation for further digital offerings to our customers. As it relates to sustainability, development of our renewable gas projects remains on track. We expect the first tranche of these projects related to our joint venture to come online beginning in late 2023. We are pleased to work with BP on these RNG projects, who recently announced its intent to acquire Archaea. This provides additional opportunities to work together on decarbonization and environmental services initiatives. Regarding polymer centers, we are accelerating the development of these projects and now expect to invest an additional $40 million of capital this year to start working on future locations. Finally, our company values guide everything we do. I am proud of our recent certification as a Great Place To Work for the sixth consecutive year. This is a significant achievement as employee retention and recruiting remains a top priority in today\u2019s market. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price during the third quarter was 6.9%, which included open market pricing of 8.7% and restricted pricing of 4%. The components of core price included small container of 10.7%, large container of 7.6% and residential of 6.7%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.6%, an increase of 60 basis points when compared to our second quarter performance. Average yield on related revenue was 6.3%. The team continues to dynamically adjust price on new and existing business to offset higher levels of inflation in our operating costs and capital expenditures. Third quarter volume increased 2.2%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 2.3%, an increase in large container of 1.7% and an increase in landfill of 6.8%. Our customer retention rate remained strong at over 94%. Moving on to recycling, commodity prices were $162 per ton in the quarter. This compares to $230 per ton in the prior year. Recycling, processing and commodity sales were a 130 basis point headwind to internal growth during the quarter. We are now forecasting fourth quarter commodity prices to be approximately $90 per ton. This would result in a full year average commodity price of $165 per ton. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business, third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $343 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 18.7%, a sequential increase of 160 basis points. This includes our existing operations in the Gulf and Northeast, together with the addition of US Ecology. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 29.2%. This compares to 30.5% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 150 basis point decrease from acquisitions, including 90 basis points related to US Ecology and a 40 basis point headwind from lower commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase from net fuel and underlying margin expansion of 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 30.5%. SG&A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 9.8% of revenue. This is a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.67 billion, an increase of $309 million or 23% compared to the prior year. This was driven almost exclusively by EBITDA growth in the business. Similar to prior years, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, net capital expenditures of $808 million represents a little more than half of our projected full year spend. And year-to-date, adjusted cash taxes of $115 million represents 50% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $11.8 billion and total liquidity was $1.9 billion. Variable interest rates on our debt increased 1% during the third quarter and an additional 50 basis points in October. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in $36 million of additional annual interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.2x. We expect to revert to 3x leverage by mid-2023. With respect to taxes. Our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the third quarter and 24.8% on a year-to-date basis. We expect an equivalent tax impact in a range of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and an equivalent tax impact of just under 26% for the year. I will now turn the call back over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: We are proud of the results we delivered during the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Stronger contribution from price more than offset persistent cost inflation, which we have seen stabilized, but not retreat from elevated levels. That said we remain comfortable with our full year financial guidance we provided in July even with the recent drop in recycled commodity prices and increase in interest rate. Looking forward to 2023, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Recent decreases in recycled commodity prices, increased interest rates and rising fuel costs will have a direct impact on our business. While these headwinds may modulate our performance expectations, we remain confident in our ability to price ahead of cost inflation. We still expect to deliver above-average levels of growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We plan to provide detailed 2023 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon guys. Hey, Jon, I just wanted to start on US Ecology, curious how things are progressing there. It sounds like your September price type stuff. But can you just talk about how that action was received in the market and did that cover both disposal and field services?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Integration broadly is going well. I am really happy with what we purchased in terms of certainly the asset quality and also the people and culture and capabilities. And we are able to do a lot of the integration planning work ahead of the close so that we have got a team that\u2019s hit the ground running and I think the results are certainly showing that. Yes, we did put in the pricing action that was on the disposal side of the business, where we start there. We have certainly taken some more tactical pricing actions on the field services side and we have seen no degradation in volume from that. So, the market has been very receptive to that. I think it fulfills our thesis that these assets and services have a lot of value to customers. And if you provide great work, they are willing to certainly pay a fair price and we will be continuing with pricing actions into 2023 and beyond to make sure that we are getting positive returns in every stage of the value chain.\nTyler Brown: Okay, good deal. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the pricing side, obviously, another good print, but I am curious about a couple of things. Number one, do you think that the 6.9% that you posted this quarter could be the high watermark? As we look to \u201823, what do you think that 50% of the book that\u2019s restricted? What do you think that you will see on pricing in that piece as we look to \u201823?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I think the \u2013 we will get a little momentum here in the second half \u2013 on our ship side in the first half of next year, that will be 4.5% or north of 4.5%, we think, just based on the roll through of where the all the different indices that we have at this point start to hit.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And Tyler, just to put that into context, in the third quarter, the restricted pricing was 4% and in Q2, that number was 35%. So, you can see the nice acceleration as we move forward.\nTyler Brown: Yes, perfect. Okay. And then last one, just on the acquisition drag, I think, Brian, did you say 150 basis points, why was that so big?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Well, you have the combination of US Ecology was $90 million of the $150 million. We also have some of the environmental solutions transactions that we did late Q3 of last year. So, most of that, the other $60 million, starts anniversarying in the fourth quarter.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Alright, perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. First, I wanted to ask about the strong volume that we have been seeing this year. I wanted to ask about your view on the sustainability of that. I think it\u2019s been progressively maybe coming down, but I think overall fairly good. So I just wanted to ask about that?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Volume remains strong certainly in our recurring side of the business, but also in the places that are more transactional like special waste and temporary large container. We are still supply-constrained there and that\u2019s still broad-based. Now as we think into next year, right, we are planning on those growth rates modulating a bit just because we are reading the same things you all are around some economic pullback. But frankly, I would have expected to see some of that already. We remain very, very positive in that volume environment right now.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And all the demand signals that we watch as far as new business, new business and the small container business continues to exceed lost business and service increases are exceeding service decreases. So the demand is definitely there.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And on the OCC, I know you mentioned the expectation for, I should say, commodity basket, you mentioned the $90 a ton for 4Q. Is the sensitivity that you give in the filings, the $10 million impact to revenue and profitability for $10 a ton, is that fair \u2013 like is that going to still hold for this or is there a sensitivity on certain levels of where it is? And also, if you could help us think about the main components within the basket? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. No, that sensitivity will hold, right? So right now, if we were to sit there and look at $90 a ton, if that held true for all of \u201823 compared to the $165 average that we\u2019re projecting for \u201822, that would be a decrease of about $75 million of both revenue and EBITDA on the commodity line item.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the question. Can I follow-up on that one. So the $75 million theoretically of revenue flowing right to EBITDA on the commodity line item, can you talk about offsets to that in terms of processing fees or other structures you have? I know you\u2019ve done a lot of work to delink the commodity exposure. So any clarification you can provide there would be helpful.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. No, that\u2019s a net number. So if you remember, if you go back and look at our filings a couple of years ago, the sensitivity to a $10 change was $20 million. So we\u2019ve cut that in half, and that\u2019s by being able to go in and actually share, right, in that volatility with the customer. So that\u2019s where you really see that change. When we talk about that $10 equaling about $10 million worth of EBITDA, that is a net number.\nNoah Kaye: $10 million of EBITDA, but not $10 million of revenue? Just to clarify.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: It\u2019s both. It\u2019s $10 million of revenue and EBITDA. Because again, if you think about what we did is that when we actually went in and changed the structure of the recycling contract, we basically just put that into the base rate. So that\u2019s how we actually wound up offsetting some of that volatility. So that\u2019s why when you look at the sensitivity now, it\u2019s the $10 change is $10 million to both revenue and EBITDA because just isolating the commodity impact, the service fee that we\u2019re charging to either actually the process the material or to collect that material is going to stay unchanged regardless of what the commodity price is.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Very helpful. There is been some discussion of \u2013 you mentioned interest expense looking at next year, but also bonus depreciation stepping down. Can you talk about that? And any other puts and takes you think about for free cash flow conversion as we look to next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Look, if you \u2013 just from an interest expense perspective, if you take a look at year-over-year, and if this is assuming a 125 basis-point hike in the fourth quarter, that would be about a $70 million increase to interest expense year-over-year, which, in isolation, it\u2019s about a 100 basis-point headwind to free cash flow conversion. That said, though, we had a plan that called for pricing in excess of cost inflation and to drive very strong growth. So even though these are some new headwinds that are presenting into our plan for next year, we still expect very strong growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. I mean in reiterating, I just want to make this point right and please nuance as it makes sense. But in saying you\u2019re comfortable with this year\u2019s guidance and point to above average growth for next year, I mean it\u2019s really pricing and operating leverage in solid waste that\u2019s making up some of these headwinds, if you will. And I just want to get your view on whether or not there is incremental pricing that you can put through looking at \u201823 to shore up some of those gaps.\nJon Vander Ark: Well, I\u2019d also say it\u2019s also growth and margin expansion in Environmental Solutions. Nothing offset it, right? We\u2019ve got plans there to continue to cross-sell continue to price, right, and drive our cost synergy numbers there. So you\u2019ll see nice margin expansion in that part of the business as well. We\u2019re committed to price ahead of cost inflation under almost any steady scenario, obviously, right, in a black sponsor area, where we get into crazy levels of interest rates, right? We will come back and talk then. But we\u2019ve been in a pretty high interest rate environment and lower interest rate environment, and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of \u2013 in both scenarios or both cases, pricing ahead of cost inflation. And we\u2019re doing that playing a long game, right? We have customers. This is a loyalty business. So we\u2019re always going to do things that maximize the lifetime value of the business and, therefore, drive intrinsic value versus doing anything unnatural in a quarter that might drive short-term results but aren\u2019t really good for the shareholders longer-term.\nNoah Kaye: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chang of CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chang: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the comments you made on the small container yield improvement, continues to be outsized well \u2013 I, mean, you\u2019re going to get good pricing everywhere, but especially seems continue to be outsized. Just can you just explain to me why that is \u2013 why are you seeing even stronger pricing of small container relative to your other...\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I think it\u2019s a combination of things, Kevin. I think it\u2019s certainly customer mix. We want to be with customers who are willing to pay more. We\u2019ve got pretty sophisticated tools in our sales and marketing teams to identify those customers and present them with an offering where they are willing to pay more. More transactional parts of the business, for example, brokers, we just pushed that out of our portfolio because they are renters. For renting, those customers, they are not going to be with us for a long time. And so the mix certainly helps us. And then the offering we put in front of customers in terms of digital tools, the sophistication of our pricing that allows us to give very targeted pricing to a customer and understanding billings to pay. All of those things drive yield, which is the ultimate pricing metric. Core price is a means to an end. The ultimate metric which ties to the P&L and margin expansion is yield.\nKevin Chang: Okay. No, no, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just my second one, the 160-basis-point sequential improvement in EBITDA margin in Environmental Solutions. You talked about some of the early wins in terms of pricing and cross-selling and cost-cutting. Just as you think about that 160, like is there a bucket that primarily drove that? Would it be primarily the cost-cutting and then build off of business, some of the other synergies roll through or was it kind of a mix of things that drove that 160?\nJon Vander Ark: No, it\u2019s a mix of things. All have contributed and that really that balanced approach is what we look for going forward as we look to take a business, again. That was in the mid- to high teens. And over a longer period of time, we think there is no reason that business can\u2019t be in the mid to high 20s, right? That\u2019s where over a period of years, we think we can take the business.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, remember, too, there is obviously seasonality in that business, just like there is in the recycling and solid waste business, and so Q3 seasonally tends to be that highest quarter. So I think as we get more quarters as well, you\u2019ll start to see the growth year-over-year. But I think you\u2019re definitely going to see as, Jon mentioned. You\u2019re going to see a combination of pricing actions. You\u2019re going to see some of the cost takeout that we\u2019ve done as we realize some of the and benefit from some of the cross-selling.\nKevin Chang: Thank you for taking my question and congrats with the good results here.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: So I went back here as fast as I could do this while we\u2019re on the call. I think for 10 years, you all have given some kind of indication of what the next year is going to be in the third quarter. So this is like the first time you\u2019re not in 10 years and yet \u2013 then you say sales EBITDA and free cash flow will be up. So can you help us a little bit on how to understand what\u2019s the messaging? What\u2019s that mean, up a little, up a lot, up like \u2013 how do we make sure we get the right place to land on \u201823?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We had talked about last quarter, we thought we\u2019d potentially a line of sight to double-digit revenue growth, right? We\u2019re probably off that a little bit in terms of what our expectations are for a couple of reasons. One is commodity price, those coming down. They obviously have a revenue impact and a margin impact. The second is some of the acquisitions that we had hoped to close in the fourth quarter get pushed out. So we feel very confident that those are going to be deals that close, but they are going to roll into the first quarter; in one case, the second quarter, which just pushes the rollover effect of that revenue benefit. And then the market, I think, is getting a little more uncertain, as you see, from a broader macro standpoint. All that being said, Michael, we feel really good about high single-digit revenue growth kind of in line with that EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth. So \u2013 and those, if you think about, to get back to a 10-year period, right, those are certainly above average numbers for the performance in a very challenging environment. So we\u2019re very optimistic about the rate. It\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re not giving some more formal type of indication, if you go back 5 years, it\u2019s a pretty predictable recurring revenue business. So you got a lot of visibility we\u2019re living in very dynamic in different times in terms of what\u2019s happening with interest rates and labor tightness and inflation and all those things. So I think that\u2019s just \u2013 commodity prices. Given all those uncertainties, we thought we\u2019re going to be in a better position 3 months from now to provide more clarity.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. But at least we\u2019ve got some guardrails we can live in based on what you just shared, so thank you for that. And then you did give us a sense of restricted price first half, 4.5%, but the rate of inflation can be accelerating in the second half. So the assumption would be that restricted price in the second half would be greater than the 4.5% at the current trend hold. Is that the right observation?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to be significantly different, Michael, throughout the year. I would kind of put again in that 4.5% to 5% range, right, for the full year. Again, we\u2019re exiting Q3 at $4. So you\u2019ll see some acceleration, but I think it will be moderate acceleration throughout the year.\nMichael Hoffman: And one last thing on price. Is your starting open market price, your exit rate from 4Q?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. For the most part. I mean, look, if you look at where we\u2019re saying right now with a 5.6% average yield on total revenue, call it around 6% on related revenue in total. If you think about the open market portion of that, we would see that participating next year or contributing relatively in line with what we got this year.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then one just tweak as you getting asked about volume. I mean you\u2019re getting \u2013 you\u2019re still seeing your good correlation in household formation, new business formation. You alluded to positive enteric interval changes, new business exceeding loss business, but the rate of change will start to narrow because we were off of a pretty healthy recovery in the second half of \u201821 into the first half of \u201822. So we\u2019re going to start normalizing into a more narrow rate of change, but the trend underlying is still positive.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Absolutely, Michael. That\u2019s our expectation when we think about \u201823%, that\u2019s sort of a modular. And we think you start seeing that in the fourth quarter, Michael, and then again, getting to a more normalized level of growth.\nMichael Hoffman: Great. Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much. Thank you for taking my question here. Let me start on the cross-selling opportunities. I think, Jon, you mentioned earlier, $75 million to $100 million eventually. You\u2019re at the $25 million mark now. Are you still on track from a timing perspective and achieving that full run rate of cross-selling? Or if it\u2019s changed, can you comment on that? Has it been pulled forward or push back at all and why?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We said we\u2019d achieve that by 2024. That\u2019s the time frame that we said, could be at \u201825 already given that we\u2019re still working through some integration, rolling this thing out. We have not touched many of our customers yet. We\u2019re really, really pleased about our progress, and I would say quite optimistic about hitting both the level and the timing of that.\nWalter Spracklin: Perfect, perfect. On the OCC prices, your peer yesterday or earlier mentioned that your contracts or their contracts are structured so that the further OCC goes down, the negative impact that sensitivity that you highlighted kind of contracts, the lower OCC goes. I just want to make sure, are your contracts designed similarly that, that plays out in your contracts as well so that it\u2019s not as strict? You mentioned $10. But does that $10 contract when OCC prices go down \u2013 the further that OCC prices go down?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And that\u2019s what \u2013 in the guidance itself and that we put out there, I would sit there and say, on the way up and the way down, that $10 equating to $10 million of revenue and both EBITDA is good sensitivity to use from a modeling perspective. So again, the type of work that you\u2019re doing can dictate that, whether or not you\u2019re brokering or that sort of thing, those sort of things can be different company to company, but that\u2019s our sensitivity.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. And last question here is you mentioned BP\u2019s purchase of Archaea there that you\u2019re optimistic working with them and all that. Anything that you can add? Have you spoken to the folks at BP at all? What kind of new ways would you look at partnering with them? Or is it just what you had before is pretty much what you have now and expect to have going forward? Or is there something additional now that you have a new owner?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. yes, we\u2019re talking at many levels, including talking to their CEO. They have to probably tick up big, bold, ambitious plans around sustainability and decarbonization, and we think there is a number of ways that can work together. Certainly, in the core JV itself, and they are fully committed to that, and we\u2019re getting the best of both worlds because the colleagues from Archaea that they are going to acquire are going to stay. So we feel really excited about that team, but bringing more resources to bear that will certainly help us hit our marks and maybe move a little faster on that front. And then they have a big business. So they have got a big Environmental Services business. So there is ways to partner together there. They have a major network of gas stations, and gas station is actually a major plays that plastic leak out of the value chain and don\u2019t get recycled. So there is ways to pilot and innovate there. And we\u2019ve done nothing formal together on those fronts yet, obviously, but have like-minded ambitions in terms of making the world more environmentally-sustainable and doing that in a way that drives growth for our shareholders as well.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. So it\u2019s an opportunity to get creative and advance that initiative. That\u2019s great. Okay. I appreciate the time. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about, for the recycling line of business at the commodity price that you mentioned for the fourth quarter, do you anticipate the business being in a net profit position? Can you just comment on that? And then nice to hear about the reiteration of guidance despite that headwind of $20 million, $30 million from recycling. Can you just talk about what part of the guidance has evolved ahead of expectations? It sounds like it might be yield, but I would love it if you could flesh that out. Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So just your first question there at the $90 commodity price, yes, that portion of the business would remain profitable at that level. And then the second part, when you talk about the evolving guide, you\u2019re talking about with respect to \u201822?\nJerry Revich: Correct.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So you\u2019re talking about just the puts and takes?\nJerry Revich: That\u2019s right. Yes. So it sounds like you\u2019re able to overcome the recycling headwinds. It feels like yield has accelerated at our expectations, but I\u2019m wondering if I could just get you to expand on that.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, better overall yield, better volume performance as we were able to overcome the commodity headwind as well as the higher interest rates in the third quarter. As we now look in the fourth quarter though the big drop really happened recently, so September into October. So again, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve maintained the guide because the outperformance from Q3 is basically funding what we expect now for Q4, and we feel pretty good about the full year guide.\nJerry Revich: And then conceptually, as you think about pricing for the long-term into \u201823, obviously, you don\u2019t want to drive churn. But it sounds like based on your prior comments that we are going to think about pushing pricing in municipal solid waste to essentially fund the recycling headwind, is what I think I am hearing from you. But can I trouble you to put a finer point on that, please?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We think we are always going to try to price ahead of our cost inflation, Jerry. And obviously, demise our headwind on that front. But we don\u2019t think about it is because now there is a short-term headwind that we are going to go out and go put a bunch of price in the market that we could be destructive from a long-term value creation with our customers on that front. So, we feel good, like I said, into \u201823, that even with these headwinds that we are going to have high-single digit growth on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Just given that we are overcoming that commodity headwind, I think speaks to the strength of the business.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. I mean we talked about the fact that we have seen elevated cost inflation in the business. We see that rolling into \u201823. And right now, we are making our plan is if that cost inflation stays in the business for the full year. So that\u2019s where the pricing ahead of cost inflation that\u2019s where that comment is. Now look, if inflation is lower than we think or it starts to abate, then that could be some upside to our current plan, but that\u2019s not how we are going into it. So, we do \u2013 versus our original expectations, we do expect the impact of both lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates have an impact on where we thought we were headed as of nine days ago. But as we just kind of talked about with Michael, we still think the outcome is going to be very strong, especially in the context when you look at an average growth rate and revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion. We think they are all very strong metrics, all growing.\nJerry Revich: Super. And lastly, I am wondering, can you just talk about the evolution for off-take agreements in landfill gas in addition to capital deployed by BP. Kinder Morgan has obviously bought some assets as well. Can you just provide an update on off-take agreement visibility? It sounded like the market was moving into the 20s per MMBtu on a multiyear basis. I am not sure if you feel comfortable commenting on that. And how the shape of the market has evolved since the last public update a quarter ago? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: No, we are still on track and still the same view that we are going to fix a portion of this and play spot on the market with the rest of it, which has been probably we think that, that balance between maximizing returns as well as predictability over the cycle and managing risk on that. Certainly have alignment with BP on that same philosophy on the back end of these facilities.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to come back to the comment about the \u2013 a couple of those acquisitions that slid to the right a little bit. I am curious, could you help us with the annualized revenue associated with those? I think we have got 300 basis points kind of locked for rollover with ECOL, but just trying to flesh out what that number could ultimately look like.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. From a rollover perspective right now, that\u2019s what we are planning is that the 300 basis points of rollover, as Jon mentioned, there were a couple of deals that were in the offer and they still are where we thought they might close in Q4. They are now looking like they could be early to mid \u201823. So, we will keep you updated on that progress. But right now, we are building the plan with 300 basis points of acquisition rollover.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. So, you don\u2019t want to give any hints on the magnitude of those acquisitions that are in the hopper?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, we will tell you when they are closed.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then I just wanted to make sure I understand the ECOL contribution within that bridge to 2023. Obviously, we get a full year of revenue. But I am just curious how you guys are thinking roughly about the growth rate in ECOL\u2019s top line and I think we have got a lot of different pieces to work with here. But just in terms of where we are going to end up on ECOL margins this year, what you guys think that will be for the full year next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, of that 300 basis points of rollover, call it, $250 million of it is related to U.S. psychology. If you just think about in the context of consolidated company margin, we look at that additional four months of rollover, having about a 30 basis point headwind on total company margin in \u201823.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. And does that assume status quo margins for ECOL year-on-year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Slight step-up as we realized a portion of the synergies again. But for the most part, that\u2019s going to be in the ZIP code.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKyle White: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to pricing. Just curious, are you starting to see any kind of pushback from customers? It seems like everyone six months ago is willing to pay higher prices? And now the environment has changed. Is it somewhat \u2013 so curious how those dialogues have gone? And if you have seen any kind of pushback that you would mention?\nJon Vander Ark: No, we are still \u2013 like we said, we put out the highest in our open portion of the business, put up the highest gross price we ever have and have the highest realization rate as the percentage that we ever had, which is an astounding number on that back. So, pricing is certainly sticking at elevated levels. The only place we have got challenges in small micro markets where we have had some challenges with turnover, given labor constraints. Obviously, when you are not providing the service that you want in a given market, right, you are going to cause the customers to reconsider and go elsewhere. And so that\u2019s why we are into, 2023, still planning on relatively elevated inflation levels because we run the business forever. And we want to make sure that we provide customers world-class service, and that will keep them staying and stay longer.\nKyle White: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the \u2013 you talked about this a little bit. So, as you think about 2023 in kind of underlying solid waste expansion margins, I think this year, you are probably running about 60 basis points \u2013 50 basis points to 60 basis points. And so if you are pricing at these elevated levels of inflation that you are seeing today and that carries into 2023, would that equate to, again, 50 basis points to 60 basis points with the potential to go even higher if we are in a more moderate inflationary environment next year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We sat across the cycle, 30 basis points to 50 basis points is what we think about doing in recycling solid waste. And we will do that over time, right, at an elevated level in environmental solutions. Could that creep higher next year if pricing stick and inflation comes down in the back half, it certainly could. We are not expecting that in terms of building a plan around it, but that would cause that gap to widen and allow for a little more margin expansion in the second half and certainly then going into 2024.\nKyle White: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Thank you. You previously outlined that your revenues have about a 90% correlation with housing starts on a 1-year lag. Is it correct to say that you believe that this is very strong pricing and maybe some environmental solutions can change that historical correlation? And just either way, as starts have clearly been declining and mortgage rates continue to surge, are there any incremental actions that you are eyeing relative to the back half of next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Eyeing as far as \u2013 because again, look, that\u2019s been a historical correlation. But again, I think that\u2019s been in a, call it, a relatively stable macro environment. And we are \u2013 we have been in anything, but kind of have these puts and takes with inflation. So, again, at this point, as Jon mentioned, we are going to continue to price in excess of cost inflation. From an overall demand perspective, again, we have actually seen the demand very strong throughout \u201822. We are not really seeing any signs of that abating. So, again, that\u2019s how we are building our plan. Growth levels probably won\u2019t be as strong as they were \u2013 or certainly won\u2019t be as strong as they were in \u201822 just because we were still recovering units from the pandemic, but we still expect underlying unit growth in \u201823 year-over-year.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. So, maybe directionally, you still think there is some correlation there, but not necessarily of the magnitude depending on starts, is what I am hearing. Could we talk about the interest rate? You said 1% change in rate is $36 million in interest expense. What was the reference rate in the third quarter from which to build to the fourth quarter in 2023 then?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, again, right now, what we are expecting is another 125 basis point increase, right, in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s how we built our plan, and then that being relatively stable throughout 2023. If you think about what that means relative to where we were exiting Q3, that\u2019s a good 125 basis points for the \u2013 when we think about where we are in Q4, good 125 basis points from where we were exiting Q2. So, the impact of that as we think about year-over-year is a $70 million increase in total interest expense, which is about a $50 million increase to cash flow once you net out the related taxes.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good afternoon.\nJon Vander Ark: Go ahead Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: I wanted to touch on your tech investments and digital tools. I appreciate the update on the RISE platform. It would be helpful if you could share, I don\u2019t know, any KPIs or benefits that you are seeing from the early rollout of those tools on the efficiency side. And as we think to 2023, kind of what\u2019s in the pipeline from the digital tools and some investments that might be in the works?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We have certainly seen over the last 18 months productivity benefit, which allows us to get more work done in the same amount of time with great customer service and doing it safely, primary value for our drivers. So, we \u2013 from a cost standpoint, we think we have taken out almost $50 million at this point. And we think over the next 18 months, we have got another $50 million that we can take out of the business as we get full deployment and full utilization of this. And then when you connect it back to the customer, all that information allows us to communicate with a customer, right, with this Track My Truck we talked about. That allows the customer to see where we are and when the pickup is going to occur. And it not only allows in some cases, them to look for themselves, right, where their vehicle is and when the pickup is coming, but even if they decide to use a different channel and call our customer service center, then we are able to have our agent look up there and give the customer it will be there tomorrow or range, but give them a far more precise time that the truck is on the way and get the customer assured. So, a lot of what we get is that, right. We really run so precise that we are there within a 5-hour, 45-minute window every week or multiple times a week for a customer. And so when we miss that window, even if we are going to be there that day, the customers call and they are concerned. So, this allows us to provide better information take cost out of the system and \u2013 we are not going to talk about those today, but you are going to see more innovation come off that, that make the customer offering differentiated that we think can directly hit the P&L in terms of customers staying longer.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you. And then just touching on the M&A side, maybe on the traditional waste, are you seeing any changes in demand or interest levels in this environment?\nJon Vander Ark: No, I think the pipeline is certainly strong, and there is significant willingness to sell. We are obviously maintaining a lot of discretion, right. Some companies don\u2019t fit us from a profile standpoint, from a value standpoint. They might not be a good fit for us. So, we remain very discriminating in terms of what we buy. But the pipeline is very, very strong. It\u2019s getting harder to do business. If you think about the digital investments, we just talked about. That\u2019s becoming a second moat. It\u2019s not just the post-collection infrastructure. All of those investments we make are very expensive. They take a lot of time. They take a lot of expertise. So, that makes it tough, or the current labor environment makes it more challenging. The current supply chain being constrained, right, we are only slightly delayed in deliveries of equipment because we are a great customer for our suppliers, right. We buy trucks year-in and year-out, where some of the smaller players will go years about buying and try to buy in the spot market. Well, now they are locked out. Those factories are full, and they are at the end of the line, and so you suffer to get labor. And those people you hire have to drive old equipment that\u2019s in need of repair and/or replacement, right. That\u2019s a big advantage for us to take over those businesses.\nStephanie Moore: Understood. Well, thank you so much.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Feniger: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Brian, you guys just did, on a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow of $1.67 billion, really strong. I think your guide is $1.7 billion or so. You might have touched on it earlier. Is there anything I am missing on the fourth quarter that we should be aware of, of why you are not releasing the free cash flow outlook?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, Mike, I had actually mentioned it in the remarks. So, the CapEx that we spent year-to-date, so through three quarters and the cash interest represents only about half of our expected full year spend. So, in the fourth quarter, we expect a disproportionate amount of both CapEx and cash taxes relative to the average you have seen. So, that\u2019s why you see a relatively modest Q4 contribution and why we have maintained the guide as it is on free cash flow. Some of that, as Jon mentioned, accelerating some of the investments in Polymer Center throughout the year, some of the things we have done in order to fund this outsized growth. But so you can reasonably expect a little bit more CapEx than we originally anticipated, partially being offset by a little bit less cash taxes than we originally anticipated.\nMichael Feniger: And I guess, Brian, just to follow-up with that and to put a finer point, do you plan to grow your free cash flow next year? Will that growth be in line to EBITDA growth, because obviously, in the context of where you guys are kind of targeting your free cash flow conversion over time. Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. First question, yes, we definitely expect to grow our free cash flow. And yes, it should be relatively in line with the growth in EBITDA. We would have expected to grow it a little bit more. Obviously, the impact of interest expense and recycled commodity prices impacts that, but we are fully expecting to grow.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Andrea. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their efforts and commitment to driving lasting value for all of our stakeholders. Have a good evening, and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our strong results in the third quarter demonstrate our ability to profitably grow the business and effectively manage our cost structure even with increased volatility in the broader marketplace. Cost pressures remain elevated and more persistent than we originally anticipated. In the face of those cost headwinds, we are leveraging our tools and technology to price ahead of cost inflation and drive margin expansion in the underlying business. From our perspective, customer demand remains strong and supportive of continued volume growth. The sound fundamentals in our business, together with a laser focus on the customer, position us well to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 23%, including over 12% from acquisitions; generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which is a 20% increase over the prior year; and produced more than $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 23% increase over the prior year. We remain confident that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the highest and best use of our cash flow. Year-to-date, we invested $2.6 billion of acquisitions, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is progressing as planned and we remain confident that we will achieve at least $40 million of cost synergies. Our initial pricing actions have been successful. We will continue to increase prices to ensure that all stages of the value chain earn an appropriate return. We are also gaining traction cross-selling our products and services, achieving over $25 million in new sales to-date. Apart from US Ecology, we have invested over $400 million of acquisitions this year. Substantially, all of these deals are in the recycling and solid waste space. Our robust acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity over the coming years. Year-to-date, we returned $640 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest for the future and advance our strategic initiatives to build distinctive capabilities in customers yield, digital and sustainability. With respect to customers yield, we delivered organic volume growth of 2.2% during the third quarter. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. We also demonstrated our ongoing ability to price in excess of underlying cost inflation. Floor price increased to 6.9% and average yield increased to 5.6%. This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Moving on to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools and improve the experience for both customers and employees. Our proprietary RISE tablets have been fully deployed across our large and small container route and deployment to residential route is 26% complete. The remaining residential routes are on track for completion by mid-2023. We have also launched Track My Truck. This technology connects the customer to their large and small container truck utilizing a GPS-enabled RISE tablet. This is a major milestone that serves as a foundation for further digital offerings to our customers. As it relates to sustainability, development of our renewable gas projects remains on track. We expect the first tranche of these projects related to our joint venture to come online beginning in late 2023. We are pleased to work with BP on these RNG projects, who recently announced its intent to acquire Archaea. This provides additional opportunities to work together on decarbonization and environmental services initiatives. Regarding polymer centers, we are accelerating the development of these projects and now expect to invest an additional $40 million of capital this year to start working on future locations. Finally, our company values guide everything we do. I am proud of our recent certification as a Great Place To Work for the sixth consecutive year. This is a significant achievement as employee retention and recruiting remains a top priority in today's market. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. We are proud of the results we delivered during the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Stronger contribution from price more than offset persistent cost inflation, which we have seen stabilized, but not retreat from elevated levels. That said we remain comfortable with our full year financial guidance we provided in July even with the recent drop in recycled commodity prices and increase in interest rate. Looking forward to 2023, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Recent decreases in recycled commodity prices, increased interest rates and rising fuel costs will have a direct impact on our business. While these headwinds may modulate our performance expectations, we remain confident in our ability to price ahead of cost inflation. We still expect to deliver above-average levels of growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We plan to provide detailed 2023 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Yes. I think the \u2013 we will get a little momentum here in the second half \u2013 on our ship side in the first half of next year, that will be 4.5% or north of 4.5%, we think, just based on the roll through of where the all the different indices that we have at this point start to hit. Yes. Volume remains strong certainly in our recurring side of the business, but also in the places that are more transactional like special waste and temporary large container. We are still supply-constrained there and that's still broad-based. Now as we think into next year, right, we are planning on those growth rates modulating a bit just because we are reading the same things you all are around some economic pullback. But frankly, I would have expected to see some of that already. We remain very, very positive in that volume environment right now. Well, I'd also say it's also growth and margin expansion in Environmental Solutions. Nothing offset it, right? We've got plans there to continue to cross-sell continue to price, right, and drive our cost synergy numbers there. So you'll see nice margin expansion in that part of the business as well. We're committed to price ahead of cost inflation under almost any steady scenario, obviously, right, in a black sponsor area, where we get into crazy levels of interest rates, right? We will come back and talk then. But we've been in a pretty high interest rate environment and lower interest rate environment, and we've done a pretty good job of \u2013 in both scenarios or both cases, pricing ahead of cost inflation. And we're doing that playing a long game, right? We have customers. This is a loyalty business. So we're always going to do things that maximize the lifetime value of the business and, therefore, drive intrinsic value versus doing anything unnatural in a quarter that might drive short-term results but aren't really good for the shareholders longer-term. Yes, I think it's a combination of things, Kevin. I think it's certainly customer mix. We want to be with customers who are willing to pay more. We've got pretty sophisticated tools in our sales and marketing teams to identify those customers and present them with an offering where they are willing to pay more. More transactional parts of the business, for example, brokers, we just pushed that out of our portfolio because they are renters. For renting, those customers, they are not going to be with us for a long time. And so the mix certainly helps us. And then the offering we put in front of customers in terms of digital tools, the sophistication of our pricing that allows us to give very targeted pricing to a customer and understanding billings to pay. All of those things drive yield, which is the ultimate pricing metric. Core price is a means to an end. The ultimate metric which ties to the P&L and margin expansion is yield. No, it's a mix of things. All have contributed and that really that balanced approach is what we look for going forward as we look to take a business, again. That was in the mid- to high teens. And over a longer period of time, we think there is no reason that business can't be in the mid to high 20s, right? That's where over a period of years, we think we can take the business. Thank you. Yes. We had talked about last quarter, we thought we'd potentially a line of sight to double-digit revenue growth, right? We're probably off that a little bit in terms of what our expectations are for a couple of reasons. One is commodity price, those coming down. They obviously have a revenue impact and a margin impact. The second is some of the acquisitions that we had hoped to close in the fourth quarter get pushed out. So we feel very confident that those are going to be deals that close, but they are going to roll into the first quarter; in one case, the second quarter, which just pushes the rollover effect of that revenue benefit. And then the market, I think, is getting a little more uncertain, as you see, from a broader macro standpoint. All that being said, Michael, we feel really good about high single-digit revenue growth kind of in line with that EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth. So \u2013 and those, if you think about, to get back to a 10-year period, right, those are certainly above average numbers for the performance in a very challenging environment. So we're very optimistic about the rate. It's the reason why we're not giving some more formal type of indication, if you go back 5 years, it's a pretty predictable recurring revenue business. So you got a lot of visibility we're living in very dynamic in different times in terms of what's happening with interest rates and labor tightness and inflation and all those things. So I think that's just \u2013 commodity prices. Given all those uncertainties, we thought we're going to be in a better position 3 months from now to provide more clarity. Yes. We said we'd achieve that by 2024. That's the time frame that we said, could be at \u201825 already given that we're still working through some integration, rolling this thing out. We have not touched many of our customers yet. We're really, really pleased about our progress, and I would say quite optimistic about hitting both the level and the timing of that. Yes. We think we are always going to try to price ahead of our cost inflation, Jerry. And obviously, demise our headwind on that front. But we don't think about it is because now there is a short-term headwind that we are going to go out and go put a bunch of price in the market that we could be destructive from a long-term value creation with our customers on that front. So, we feel good, like I said, into \u201823, that even with these headwinds that we are going to have high-single digit growth on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Just given that we are overcoming that commodity headwind, I think speaks to the strength of the business. No, we are still on track and still the same view that we are going to fix a portion of this and play spot on the market with the rest of it, which has been probably we think that, that balance between maximizing returns as well as predictability over the cycle and managing risk on that. Certainly have alignment with BP on that same philosophy on the back end of these facilities. Well, we will tell you when they are closed. No, we are still \u2013 like we said, we put out the highest in our open portion of the business, put up the highest gross price we ever have and have the highest realization rate as the percentage that we ever had, which is an astounding number on that back. So, pricing is certainly sticking at elevated levels. The only place we have got challenges in small micro markets where we have had some challenges with turnover, given labor constraints. Obviously, when you are not providing the service that you want in a given market, right, you are going to cause the customers to reconsider and go elsewhere. And so that's why we are into, 2023, still planning on relatively elevated inflation levels because we run the business forever. And we want to make sure that we provide customers world-class service, and that will keep them staying and stay longer. Yes. We sat across the cycle, 30 basis points to 50 basis points is what we think about doing in recycling solid waste. And we will do that over time, right, at an elevated level in environmental solutions. Could that creep higher next year if pricing stick and inflation comes down in the back half, it certainly could. We are not expecting that in terms of building a plan around it, but that would cause that gap to widen and allow for a little more margin expansion in the second half and certainly then going into 2024. Go ahead Stephanie. Yes. We have certainly seen over the last 18 months productivity benefit, which allows us to get more work done in the same amount of time with great customer service and doing it safely, primary value for our drivers. So, we \u2013 from a cost standpoint, we think we have taken out almost $50 million at this point. And we think over the next 18 months, we have got another $50 million that we can take out of the business as we get full deployment and full utilization of this. And then when you connect it back to the customer, all that information allows us to communicate with a customer, right, with this Track My Truck we talked about. That allows the customer to see where we are and when the pickup is going to occur. And it not only allows in some cases, them to look for themselves, right, where their vehicle is and when the pickup is coming, but even if they decide to use a different channel and call our customer service center, then we are able to have our agent look up there and give the customer it will be there tomorrow or range, but give them a far more precise time that the truck is on the way and get the customer assured. So, a lot of what we get is that, right. We really run so precise that we are there within a 5-hour, 45-minute window every week or multiple times a week for a customer. And so when we miss that window, even if we are going to be there that day, the customers call and they are concerned. So, this allows us to provide better information take cost out of the system and \u2013 we are not going to talk about those today, but you are going to see more innovation come off that, that make the customer offering differentiated that we think can directly hit the P&L in terms of customers staying longer. No, I think the pipeline is certainly strong, and there is significant willingness to sell. We are obviously maintaining a lot of discretion, right. Some companies don't fit us from a profile standpoint, from a value standpoint. They might not be a good fit for us. So, we remain very discriminating in terms of what we buy. But the pipeline is very, very strong. It's getting harder to do business. If you think about the digital investments, we just talked about. That's becoming a second moat. It's not just the post-collection infrastructure. All of those investments we make are very expensive. They take a lot of time. They take a lot of expertise. So, that makes it tough, or the current labor environment makes it more challenging. The current supply chain being constrained, right, we are only slightly delayed in deliveries of equipment because we are a great customer for our suppliers, right. We buy trucks year-in and year-out, where some of the smaller players will go years about buying and try to buy in the spot market. Well, now they are locked out. Those factories are full, and they are at the end of the line, and so you suffer to get labor. And those people you hire have to drive old equipment that's in need of repair and/or replacement, right. That's a big advantage for us to take over those businesses. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price during the third quarter was 6.9%, which included open market pricing of 8.7% and restricted pricing of 4%. The components of core price included small container of 10.7%, large container of 7.6% and residential of 6.7%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.6%, an increase of 60 basis points when compared to our second quarter performance. Average yield on related revenue was 6.3%. The team continues to dynamically adjust price on new and existing business to offset higher levels of inflation in our operating costs and capital expenditures. Third quarter volume increased 2.2%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 2.3%, an increase in large container of 1.7% and an increase in landfill of 6.8%. Our customer retention rate remained strong at over 94%. Moving on to recycling, commodity prices were $162 per ton in the quarter. This compares to $230 per ton in the prior year. Recycling, processing and commodity sales were a 130 basis point headwind to internal growth during the quarter. We are now forecasting fourth quarter commodity prices to be approximately $90 per ton. This would result in a full year average commodity price of $165 per ton. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business, third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $343 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 18.7%, a sequential increase of 160 basis points. This includes our existing operations in the Gulf and Northeast, together with the addition of US Ecology. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 29.2%. This compares to 30.5% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 150 basis point decrease from acquisitions, including 90 basis points related to US Ecology and a 40 basis point headwind from lower commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase from net fuel and underlying margin expansion of 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 30.5%. SG&A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 9.8% of revenue. This is a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.67 billion, an increase of $309 million or 23% compared to the prior year. This was driven almost exclusively by EBITDA growth in the business. Similar to prior years, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, net capital expenditures of $808 million represents a little more than half of our projected full year spend. And year-to-date, adjusted cash taxes of $115 million represents 50% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $11.8 billion and total liquidity was $1.9 billion. Variable interest rates on our debt increased 1% during the third quarter and an additional 50 basis points in October. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in $36 million of additional annual interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.2x. We expect to revert to 3x leverage by mid-2023. With respect to taxes. Our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the third quarter and 24.8% on a year-to-date basis. We expect an equivalent tax impact in a range of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and an equivalent tax impact of just under 26% for the year. I will now turn the call back over to Jon. Yes. Integration broadly is going well. I am really happy with what we purchased in terms of certainly the asset quality and also the people and culture and capabilities. And we are able to do a lot of the integration planning work ahead of the close so that we have got a team that's hit the ground running and I think the results are certainly showing that. Yes, we did put in the pricing action that was on the disposal side of the business, where we start there. We have certainly taken some more tactical pricing actions on the field services side and we have seen no degradation in volume from that. So, the market has been very receptive to that. I think it fulfills our thesis that these assets and services have a lot of value to customers. And if you provide great work, they are willing to certainly pay a fair price and we will be continuing with pricing actions into 2023 and beyond to make sure that we are getting positive returns in every stage of the value chain. Yes. And Tyler, just to put that into context, in the third quarter, the restricted pricing was 4% and in Q2, that number was 35%. So, you can see the nice acceleration as we move forward. Well, you have the combination of US Ecology was $90 million of the $150 million. We also have some of the environmental solutions transactions that we did late Q3 of last year. So, most of that, the other $60 million, starts anniversarying in the fourth quarter. And all the demand signals that we watch as far as new business, new business and the small container business continues to exceed lost business and service increases are exceeding service decreases. So the demand is definitely there. Yes. No, that sensitivity will hold, right? So right now, if we were to sit there and look at $90 a ton, if that held true for all of \u201823 compared to the $165 average that we're projecting for \u201822, that would be a decrease of about $75 million of both revenue and EBITDA on the commodity line item. Yes. No, that's a net number. So if you remember, if you go back and look at our filings a couple of years ago, the sensitivity to a $10 change was $20 million. So we've cut that in half, and that's by being able to go in and actually share, right, in that volatility with the customer. So that's where you really see that change. When we talk about that $10 equaling about $10 million worth of EBITDA, that is a net number. It's both. It's $10 million of revenue and EBITDA. Because again, if you think about what we did is that when we actually went in and changed the structure of the recycling contract, we basically just put that into the base rate. So that's how we actually wound up offsetting some of that volatility. So that's why when you look at the sensitivity now, it's the $10 change is $10 million to both revenue and EBITDA because just isolating the commodity impact, the service fee that we're charging to either actually the process the material or to collect that material is going to stay unchanged regardless of what the commodity price is. Yes. Look, if you \u2013 just from an interest expense perspective, if you take a look at year-over-year, and if this is assuming a 125 basis-point hike in the fourth quarter, that would be about a $70 million increase to interest expense year-over-year, which, in isolation, it's about a 100 basis-point headwind to free cash flow conversion. That said, though, we had a plan that called for pricing in excess of cost inflation and to drive very strong growth. So even though these are some new headwinds that are presenting into our plan for next year, we still expect very strong growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Yes, remember, too, there is obviously seasonality in that business, just like there is in the recycling and solid waste business, and so Q3 seasonally tends to be that highest quarter. So I think as we get more quarters as well, you'll start to see the growth year-over-year. But I think you're definitely going to see as, Jon mentioned. You're going to see a combination of pricing actions. You're going to see some of the cost takeout that we've done as we realize some of the and benefit from some of the cross-selling. Yes. I don't know that's going to be significantly different, Michael, throughout the year. I would kind of put again in that 4.5% to 5% range, right, for the full year. Again, we're exiting Q3 at $4. So you'll see some acceleration, but I think it will be moderate acceleration throughout the year. Yes. For the most part. I mean, look, if you look at where we're saying right now with a 5.6% average yield on total revenue, call it around 6% on related revenue in total. If you think about the open market portion of that, we would see that participating next year or contributing relatively in line with what we got this year. Absolutely, Michael. That's our expectation when we think about \u201823%, that's sort of a modular. And we think you start seeing that in the fourth quarter, Michael, and then again, getting to a more normalized level of growth. Yes. And that's what \u2013 in the guidance itself and that we put out there, I would sit there and say, on the way up and the way down, that $10 equating to $10 million of revenue and both EBITDA is good sensitivity to use from a modeling perspective. So again, the type of work that you're doing can dictate that, whether or not you're brokering or that sort of thing, those sort of things can be different company to company, but that's our sensitivity. Yes. yes, we're talking at many levels, including talking to their CEO. They have to probably tick up big, bold, ambitious plans around sustainability and decarbonization, and we think there is a number of ways that can work together. Certainly, in the core JV itself, and they are fully committed to that, and we're getting the best of both worlds because the colleagues from Archaea that they are going to acquire are going to stay. So we feel really excited about that team, but bringing more resources to bear that will certainly help us hit our marks and maybe move a little faster on that front. And then they have a big business. So they have got a big Environmental Services business. So there is ways to partner together there. They have a major network of gas stations, and gas station is actually a major plays that plastic leak out of the value chain and don't get recycled. So there is ways to pilot and innovate there. And we've done nothing formal together on those fronts yet, obviously, but have like-minded ambitions in terms of making the world more environmentally-sustainable and doing that in a way that drives growth for our shareholders as well. Yes. So just your first question there at the $90 commodity price, yes, that portion of the business would remain profitable at that level. And then the second part, when you talk about the evolving guide, you're talking about with respect to \u201822? Yes. So you're talking about just the puts and takes? Yes, better overall yield, better volume performance as we were able to overcome the commodity headwind as well as the higher interest rates in the third quarter. As we now look in the fourth quarter though the big drop really happened recently, so September into October. So again, that's why we've maintained the guide because the outperformance from Q3 is basically funding what we expect now for Q4, and we feel pretty good about the full year guide. Yes. I mean we talked about the fact that we have seen elevated cost inflation in the business. We see that rolling into \u201823. And right now, we are making our plan is if that cost inflation stays in the business for the full year. So that's where the pricing ahead of cost inflation that's where that comment is. Now look, if inflation is lower than we think or it starts to abate, then that could be some upside to our current plan, but that's not how we are going into it. So, we do \u2013 versus our original expectations, we do expect the impact of both lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates have an impact on where we thought we were headed as of nine days ago. But as we just kind of talked about with Michael, we still think the outcome is going to be very strong, especially in the context when you look at an average growth rate and revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion. We think they are all very strong metrics, all growing. Yes. From a rollover perspective right now, that's what we are planning is that the 300 basis points of rollover, as Jon mentioned, there were a couple of deals that were in the offer and they still are where we thought they might close in Q4. They are now looking like they could be early to mid \u201823. So, we will keep you updated on that progress. But right now, we are building the plan with 300 basis points of acquisition rollover. Yes. So, of that 300 basis points of rollover, call it, $250 million of it is related to U.S. psychology. If you just think about in the context of consolidated company margin, we look at that additional four months of rollover, having about a 30 basis point headwind on total company margin in \u201823. Slight step-up as we realized a portion of the synergies again. But for the most part, that's going to be in the ZIP code. Eyeing as far as \u2013 because again, look, that's been a historical correlation. But again, I think that's been in a, call it, a relatively stable macro environment. And we are \u2013 we have been in anything, but kind of have these puts and takes with inflation. So, again, at this point, as Jon mentioned, we are going to continue to price in excess of cost inflation. From an overall demand perspective, again, we have actually seen the demand very strong throughout \u201822. We are not really seeing any signs of that abating. So, again, that's how we are building our plan. Growth levels probably won't be as strong as they were \u2013 or certainly won't be as strong as they were in \u201822 just because we were still recovering units from the pandemic, but we still expect underlying unit growth in \u201823 year-over-year. Yes. So, again, right now, what we are expecting is another 125 basis point increase, right, in the fourth quarter. That's how we built our plan, and then that being relatively stable throughout 2023. If you think about what that means relative to where we were exiting Q3, that's a good 125 basis points for the \u2013 when we think about where we are in Q4, good 125 basis points from where we were exiting Q2. So, the impact of that as we think about year-over-year is a $70 million increase in total interest expense, which is about a $50 million increase to cash flow once you net out the related taxes. Yes. So, Mike, I had actually mentioned it in the remarks. So, the CapEx that we spent year-to-date, so through three quarters and the cash interest represents only about half of our expected full year spend. So, in the fourth quarter, we expect a disproportionate amount of both CapEx and cash taxes relative to the average you have seen. So, that's why you see a relatively modest Q4 contribution and why we have maintained the guide as it is on free cash flow. Some of that, as Jon mentioned, accelerating some of the investments in Polymer Center throughout the year, some of the things we have done in order to fund this outsized growth. But so you can reasonably expect a little bit more CapEx than we originally anticipated, partially being offset by a little bit less cash taxes than we originally anticipated. Yes. First question, yes, we definitely expect to grow our free cash flow. And yes, it should be relatively in line with the growth in EBITDA. We would have expected to grow it a little bit more. Obviously, the impact of interest expense and recycled commodity prices impacts that, but we are fully expecting to grow."

Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and ability to harness the positive momentum in our business. We delivered outsize revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while generating underlying margin expansion. This was achieved by pricing in excess of our internal costs inflation and continued savings from productivity initiatives. The fundamentals in our business remain strong, and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace. During the second quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, which is a 21% increase over the prior year and produce more than $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year to date basis, which is a 14% increase over the prior year. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions, and returning cash to our shareholders. Year to-date, we invested $2.5 billion in acquisitions, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is well underway and progressing as planned. We're encouraged by early cross selling results, and remain confident that we will achieve at least $40 million of cost synergies. We have one of our most robust acquisition pipelines ever with opportunities to close transactions this year and into 2023. We now expect to invest over $600 million in acquisitions apart from US Ecology for the year. Substantially all of these deals are in the recycling and solid waste space. Year to date, we returned $495 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced an increase of the dividend for the 19th consecutive year. During the second quarter, we reported organic volume growth of 2.4%, which was broad based across geographies and market verticals. Simultaneously, we demonstrated our ability to price. Core price reached an all time high of 6.2%, an average yield increased to 5%. This is the highest level of pricing and company history. At the same time, we're experiencing higher than expected inflationary pressures that continue to persist. That said, we expect to continue to price more than our internal cost inflation, ultimately leading to full year results that are projected to exceed original expectations. We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $4.77 to $4.80, and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.725 billion. This represents an increase of approximately 4% from the midpoint of the prior guidance. Finally, we believe creating a more sustainable world is both our responsibility and a platform for growth. We've recently published our latest sustainability report, highlighting the progress we're making toward our most significant opportunities to positively impact key stakeholders and the environment. We reported a 9% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from our 2017 baseline, which keeps us well-positioned to achieve our interim target of a 10% reduction by 2025. We also highlight progress made on climate leadership goals, including circular economy, and renewable energy. These goals are supported by investments were making in Polymer centres and landfill gas projects, which are progressing as planned. In addition to having a positive impact on the environment, the innovative solutions are a platform for growth. Our efforts continue to be recognized externally, as Republic was recently named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the third consecutive year. I will now turn the call over to Brian who will provide details on the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Core price during the second quarter was 6.2%, which included open market pricing of 7.8% and restricted pricing of 3.5%. The components of core price included small container of 9.7%, large container of 6.9% and residential of 5.6%. Average yield on total revenue was 5%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points when compared to our first quarter performance. Average yield unrelated revenue was 5.4%. As Jon mentioned, we continue to dynamically adjust price on new and existing business to offset higher levels of cost inflation, we've seen our operating costs and capital expenditures. Second quarter volume increased 2.4%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 2.8%, an increase in large container of 2% and an increase in landfill of 5.7%. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 95%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $218 per ton in the second quarter. This compares to $170 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $260 million from the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On the same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the environmental solutions portion of our business was 17.1% during the quarter. This includes our existing operations in the Gulf and northeast together with the addition of US Ecology. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 29.6%. This compared to 30.6% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 140 basis point decrease from acquisitions of which 60 basis points relates to US Ecology, and a 110. basis point headwind from net fuel. It's important to note, that even though net fuel was diluted to margin, we recovered over 95% of the dollar change fuel expense through fuel recovery fees. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 60 basis point contribution from relatively higher incentive compensation expense in the prior year, and most importantly, underlying margin expansion of 60 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the solid waste and recycling business was 30.8%. SG&A expenses excluding transactions costs from US Ecology were 10% of revenue. The 70 basis point improvement demonstrates our ability to effectively manage costs and gain leverage while growing the business. With respect to our outlook, our guidance implies sequential growth and adjusted EBITDA dollars of 5% to 5.5% in the second half of the year compared to our first half performance. This would continue to drive double digit EBITDA growth on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.3%. The change in margin from our initial expectations relates to the impact of US Ecology and fuel. Year to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.15 billion and increased $143 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven exclusively by EBITDA growth in the business. Year to date capital expenditures of $505 million represents 35% of our projected full year spend, and year to-date cash taxes of $79 million represents approximately 25% of our projected full year spend. We now expect full year capital expenditures in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion. This represents an increase of $130 million from the midpoint of our prior expectations. The increase includes $75 million related to US Ecology. The remainder of the increase relates to investments to support growth, and higher than anticipated costs for trucks, equipment and landfill cell development. Total debt was $12 billion and total liquidity was $1.6 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.3 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage within the next 12 months. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 23.9% during the second quarter, and 24.6% on a year to-day basis. A lower than anticipated tax rate was mostly timing related, and provided a $0.05 EPS benefit during the first half of the year. We expect this timing benefit will flip in the second half, resulting in an equivalent tax impact of 29% in the third quarter, and 26% in the fourth quarter. We still expect a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 26%. With that operator, I would like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was hoping you could give a little bit of extra color on the expectation for how pricing plays out. I know you gave some great detail in terms of where the open market versus restricted was in the quarter. But just how you think that plays out during the rest of the year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, strong. Because of that momentum on the pricing side, obviously, we're putting out more price than we ever have on the open market side and retaining at a higher percentage than we ever have. Which I think is a function of both the macro economy and inflation, and all costs going up for customers, as well as the fact that we continue to differentiate our service offering and provide something unique in the marketplace. And I don't see that changing for the remainder of the year. And then we'll get a nice pickup the second half of the year on the restricted side of the business. As those contracts kick in with underlying escalator something tied to CPI or CPI derivatives like average trash or water sewer trash, that will provide some momentum there as well.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And then in terms of US Ecology, just any additional color on surprises versus now that you've started the integration, versus what your expectations were before?\nJon Vander Ark: Generally, unplanned. Let's see -- very excited about the people. I think maybe one surprises we've been able to retain even a higher percentage of people than we expected. Again, there's good natural synergies in the deal we've talked about that. But the reason we bought this as a platform for growth, and we really respect their compliance culture, their expertise, and obviously a very unrivalled set of assets. And their team has been absolutely energized to get connected with us very strong cultural alignment. And we did a lot of work pre-merger in terms of organization structure and model and design. And we've got those teams staffed up and ready to go, and we're out moving in the marketplace. So, I'd say on balance. Its got a little more momentum than I expected at this point.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everybody. And just on the pricing question, I guess a lot of your contracts and just as you alluded are coming in the back half pretty strong. I guess that sets you up very nicely for 2023, in terms of carryover of those price -- any pricing you're doing through the year and in the back half the year. So when we look at the 2023, is there any reason why we shouldn't kind of see a continued elevated pricing rate for 2023? Obviously lapping some tougher compares as we get through the back half of 2023. But tell me if I'm wrong, but should shouldn't it remain elevated, given the late in the year pricing this year remain elevated through the first half of next year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I guess the one cautionary note, obviously, that we're living in very unique and uncertain times. And I think in the last 36 months have taught all of us some dose of humility. All that being said, the outlook from what we see right now is very, very positive. And so, you're right, the restricted portion of that book will continue to flow through. We're not going to change our stripes on the open market side of this business, right. We started, we lead with price. Our people deserve a fair wage increase. And that profit allows us to reinvest in the business and drive sustainability and all the things that we care about. So that won't change. And listen, I think we've got momentum on all three fronts. we've got momentum on the pricing side of the business. We've got momentum on the volume side of this business. And obviously, the acquisition activity, has also been very strong. And the rollover effect in the next year sets us up for what we think will end up being probably a double digit revenue year in 2023.\nWalter Spracklin: That's great color. On acquisitions, dovetails into my next question actually, is just how you're looking at acquisitions now in two ways. First of all, taking a fairly large one here with US Ecology, does that in any way kind of delay you from the cadence of acquisition or the pace and cadence of acquisitions at all? And secondly, related to that, does it -- does US Ecology now shift your attention a little bit to perhaps examining different types of acquisitions, some in hazardous, some in solid waste? Or do you kind of refocus re-center on solid waste for opportunities going forward?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. I think we talked about when we did the deal. This wasn't either or it was both end. And the timing of the deal was predicated on all the momentum we had in the traditional recycling and solid waste side of the business. And our outlook has never been stronger and more positive there for deals. I thought about what we're going to close this year and a strong pipeline in the next year. And that's where we certainly, the bulk of our acquisition spend will certainly come in that space. Now, the benefit is we've got a second platform with which we can pursue further follow-on and tuck-in acquisitions. And certainly we have a pipeline there. I think it's the only, I think it's very unlikely in the near term is we do another deal of scale in the environmental solution side of the business. Because we think we've got a great platform with US Ecology. We're building that out. Again, we'll be able to tuck in pieces along the way and in a very analogous way to the solid waste and recycling space of getting great post closure synergies on those deals as we pulled those right in.\nWalter Spracklin: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time as always.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong quarter. I'm wondering if you just talk about, as we think about the pieces for 2023, you alluded the top line. Can you just talk about the tailwinds that you folks are going to have from your investments in landfill gas and in the -- more facilities. How many facilities do we have coming online over the next 12 months as we just layer on additional tailwinds to the business as we think about what 2023 might look like at this point?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, Jerry, specifically around some of the landfill gas projects and Polymer centres and things of that nature. Anything that's going to come online is really going to be in the latter part of 2023. So the contribution to 2023 is pretty limited with respect to those projects. Now, obviously, setting up 2024 and beyond, right, that's where it starts to get more exciting with respect to those investments. Really next year is more about pricing in excess of cost inflation, the realization of the synergies with US Ecology deal.\nJerry Revich: And on that note, obviously, really strong margin performance this year, but given the high inflationary environment overall, it certainly limits. How aggressive we can get on pricing ahead of cost? What's the opportunity to make up for that next year, as hopefully, inflation slows from high singles to mid singles? Could we see a 60, 70, 80 basis point margin expansion versus half that you would typically target?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: I think the thing you have to remember, Jerry, is that on that restricted portion of our business and those indices that those contracts are tied to, they tend to lag. So again, when you take a look at what we're doing with the inflationary environment that we're experiencing today, and we're seeing that across our book, and we're able to drive underlying margin expansion this year, as we start to get those relatively higher price increases next year, we think that actually sets us up very well for continued margin expansion into 2023.\nJerry Revich: So just to be clear, it doesn't sound like we should be thinking about commercial and industrial lines of business, pricing slowing significantly. So, we're just going to get the additional kicker from the restricted business kicking in and continued level of pricing that we've seen in C&I this year. Is that right?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. The only the only caveat, I'd say is, I mean, the labor market remains constrained. And we do see some signs of that easing, right? And I would hope that that would continue to ease throughout the year, and create the opportunity in the next year, but we will do whatever. We want to run this business forever. So we'll do whatever we need to do to retain our people. So the level of margin expansion that we have in 2023 will be predicated on exactly how tight the labor market is and what we need to do with wages.\nJerry Revich: Super. Appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good afternoon. My first question is just around the restricted book. And then also as part of that just cost inflation. So, when you look at your cost buckets, do you sort of believe its -- most of those buckets have peaked, labor included? And then as part of that, when you look at your restricted book, how much of that book is on indices that are not CPI? And when they reset, do they kind of cover cost inflation that you're seeing? I know they lag. Or does it not even matter, because the open market is so strong that it will help you recover whatever you're not currently?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Let me start on the wage piece. So we're -- listen, we're seeing inflation right in the high fours. And we feel good about that number in part, because going into this high inflationary period, we thought we had a very healthy cost structure. Healthy meaning not too high, but also not too low, right. Our team does a really good job of understanding local market dynamics. And we want to be the employer of choice in those markets. Now, obviously, we've had to take up, put wages into the market this year beyond our initial plan, just given the dynamic environment. And I would say, listen, we see that certainly flattening, and kind of ending the year into the high fours on that front. Assuming that inflation comes down, if that will start to modulate as we go forward. So I think we are past the peak of this thing with the caveat of we're living in uncertain environment. So Hamzah, within that 50% book that has a contractual pricing restriction, 34% of those are directly linked to CPI, 18% are some form of alternative index. So I think just over 50% has some inflationary component baked into it. And then the other 48% is some other pricing mechanism. So it could be a fixed rate. It could be a rate review or cost plus contract, but that's basically the composition of that 50% of our book.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question. On US Ecology, you mentioned early signs of cross selling. Could you just remind us what you sized up revenue synergies at? And at the same time, is the sales cycle different than solid waste? Or just maybe -- maybe just give us some examples of the early success of cross selling? Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Sure. We value the deal, obviously, based on the standalone intrinsic value, plus $40 million of cost synergies. That being said, we think they're the revenue synergies over time will outpace that. Part of that is on the revenue synergies. So we've said, $75 million to $100 million of cross sell realized over three years. We've already gotten 15 of that. So very good early momentum on that front. And it's cutting both ways. Customers that US Ecology have that we're bringing in our services. But even more so customers that we have, we're now selling a broader set of services too. So we're in early days on that. We haven't really done a full rollout across all on our sales teams. So very excited about the momentum to hit that number. And then on pricing, we believe these are scarce assets. And again, you need to price to be able to reinvest in these assets over time and grow. And so, we put out a double digit price increase earlier this week that will go into effect in early September into the marketplace, because it's imperative that we do that. It's inflationary environment, right? We're going to reinvest in the business, and we're going to expand these margins over time.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you all. So many things to think about and choose from. So, I'm going to pick free cash flow. If the old midpoint $2.65 billion, you subtract $130 million for more CapEx. That means there's about $193 million of upside from performance between solid waste and environmental services. Can you split between them where that came from?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. That's all solid waste, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: All solid waste. Okay. So that's just shows just how dramatic the leverage of this price has been to convert that into cash. That's the other observation.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Agree.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Margins. So the US Ecology margins or the ES margins, which is basically mostly US Ecology, were came out better than if you were looking at old models for that business coming into 2Q. How much of that is -- it was a really good market for those kinds of services, and everybody had a really good quarter, all the peers versus anything that you all did do affect change? And then how do I look at your combined margin of 29.3% [ph], and convert that into what's the dollars of EBITDA?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Well, let me start with the latter part first, when you want to talk about the dollars of EBITDA. So we talked for the full year, or I'm sorry, in the second half of increasing EBITDA 5% to 5.5% over our first half performance. So, I think first half was a $1.913 billion. Second half, that would imply $2 billion to $2.20 billion for a full year 3.91 to 3.93. So, when you take a look at that 5% to 5.5% sequential growth, of 3.5% of that is just the additional amount from US Ecology just for having that for longer in that period of time. And then the rest of the business 1.5% to 2%. When you think about that 1.5% to 2% on a like-for-like basis, that's relatively consistent what would we see in a normal year. And then, on your margin questions. So when you take a look at the 17.1% for the environmental solutions business, that's -- again, I would say there wasn't much that that we were able to affect in that period of time, it's only two months. So most of the synergy capture that we expect, the cross selling opportunities that Jon mentioned, and then again, the pricing opportunities, that's more on the come. So again, I would say that was more just the strength in the business from US Ecology, which could also be just reflective of strength in the industrial market.\nMichael Hoffman: It was very good. We crossed their peer group. So it doesn't surprise me. It was good. I just was wondering how much you were able to influence already. Okay, thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I might have missed it. But just the updated yield and volume guidance for 2022, seems like both are going up here?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So, we expect that with the -- the 5%, that we just reported here in the second quarter, we would expect, as we talked about that to accelerate in the second half of the year for the reasons we discussed, so we expect to stay over 5% for the balance of the year. So, full year that would average to right around 5% on a full year basis for average yield. And right now, when we take a look at volume, we're expecting that to be at the high end of our original guidance range. So right around 2%.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. And updated margin guidance, 29.3%. I believe it was 30.3% to 30.4% before. I think Ecol was supposed to be 70 basis points of that gap. Is that what it ended up being in there? And that leaves maybe 35 basis points of fuel. But I assume fuel was actually more than that. And you're actually covering a lot of what the incremental fuel drag was with price. So if we could just flush that out, that'd be helpful?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Sure. Yes. You actually had a couple of those numbers there. So US Ecology is 70 basis points, 70 basis point drag from our original expectations. Net fuel is actually 50 basis points worse than we originally thought. We actually have 120 basis point drag between the two. And we're making that up with the rest of the business to get to that 29.3 for the year.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Nice work. Thanks for the help.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Calleja with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Calleja: Yes, thanks, guys. Just when we think about the acceleration that you mentioned, the back half with the yield, obviously, you call -- can you help us find just like the rollover of what that would look like for 2023 just based on really where we're exiting the year at and what we see with US Ecol after two months?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Are you talking about just overall revenue? Or are you just talking about specifically around yield?\nMichael Calleja: Both, if you could, just because of the core price as you accelerate, I mean, you putting these price increases through this year. So there must be some rollover benefit just by even not even increasing next year, just by run rating on the end of this year. And also for U.S. Ecol, I'm curious if there's any change in terms of the 12-month impact that we were thinking of when you originally guided?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Just a couple of things I want to clarify. So, when we're talking about core price and yield, that is on the solid waste business. That's what's included in those numbers. I want to point that out, because any change in environmental solutions revenue, whether it be price or volume is on a single line item when we sit there and reconcile the change in revenue. So, as we're talking about 5% yield, as you think about the sequential improvement from the CPI-linked contracts, we think to the second half of the year, that's probably about a 20 basis point increase or so in yield second half versus our second quarter performance, within a further step up, probably somewhere in that kind of mid fives as we sit there and look at 2023 [ph] today.\nMichael Calleja: Got it. And Brian and Jon, I'm curious, if we look back at your historical peak margin of 31% EBITDA range in 2010, 2011. I know one main factors, why margins were below that over the last decade was the low CPI. So, as we move into a CPI range of 3%, let's say, in a multi year basis, which was consistent with prior cycles, how different is the business setup today in terms of streamline operations, routing, costs, like how different is this business today with for a CPI 3%, 3.5%, long term compared to where we were in prior cycles? Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Stronger on both fronts. We're certainly stronger on the customer side, which leads to revenue on all fronts. It's a healthier customer mix. Again, I don't think that we talk enough about the economics of loyalty in this business. Every revenue dollars equals. Some customers are willing to stay with you longer. That's why core price is interesting, but yield becomes the ultimate pricing metric. And that's the one that really connects to the P&L, because it factors in the customer that you gain and lose. And you gain and lose those customers at very different rates with the same cost structure. So, yield becomes very important. So we've got the healthier customer base. We've got better tools, right and better technology that help us work with our local teams and price vary dynamically across all of our 300 plus market, so we feel better about that. And then we're more efficient. The rise of digital platform has been a big game changer for us. We've taken out $40 million of cost. And we think over the next 18 to 24 months, we got another $60 million to take out just in terms of driving efficiency and getting the same amount of work done in a shorter period of time. And so, where CPI goes? Listen, we've lived in all kinds of different environments here. I can tell you, it'd be really low, right. Doesn't work very well for the industry. And we've seen that period. The current number obviously isn't great either. Even though the results are good, we're out of balance as an economy, right with labor constraints and an unsustainable way where it's impacting consumer spending everything else. So modulating something into a 2%, 3%, 4%, I think you're going to find very healthy dynamics for our business, and really good performance.\nMichael Calleja: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nJon Vander Ark: Hi, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Brian. So I just want to clarify and be clear on modeling question here. But what is the expected revenue contribution in 2022 from M&A based on the guide?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So if you take a look at the total contribution from acquisitions, it's a 9.3%. Or that which is close, has close and that includes US Ecology. If you were to exclude US Ecology, that would be about 300 basis points.\nTyler Brown: Okay. And then is there -- you mentioned a benefit in a rollover in 2023. Can you decide based on what's closed, what rolls over?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So including US Ecology that would also be about 300 basis points. Or, again, US Ecology plus deals close today.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. And then going back to the prior question, did you say that you think your restricted book will be up circa mid 5% next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: So overall, and we kind of talked about the cadence of average yield. And so, again, with a with a 5%, average yield than the second quarter, we see second half improving 15 to 20 basis points compared to our second quarter performance. And then as we look forward to 2023, again, assuming that things stay relatively stable on the open market portion of our business, that's where we think of average yield right now in kind of that mid 5%. overall\nTyler Brown: Yield. Okay, that helps. You talked about just over $3.9 billion in EBITDA for this year. If I do that calculation, it kind of implies, call it a 43% to 44% free cash conversion. I think last quarter, you reendorsed that 47% for 2024. So, can you kind of build that bridge that three to 400 basis point uplift and conversion. I mean, is that lower leverage? Is that a better closure, post closure, cash taxes, CapEx. Just how do we get there?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. A majority of that would be as we revert to that three times leverage, right, so we're going to reduce the interest expense. At the same time though capturing the synergies, that's all going to be a creative to both EBITDA margin as well as to free cash flow conversion. So, the combination really of the US Ecology integration, the reduction in interest expense over time, is that line of sight to that 47% free cash flow conversion.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think we're 100 days in on US Ecology. Any high level thoughts about portfolio rationalization. Do all the lines make sense?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. So there's a couple of things that are a strategic review, right. And we'll announce those when we've taken a decision on those items. The vast majority of what we bought, we like, and we're going to keep and operate. And there's a couple of things that we're taking a look at that might not be the best fit, somebody else might be the natural owner.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Last one, I promise. And it's a bit of a strange question. But is there an extra workday in Q3, because of how 4th of July fell?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: I think Q3 is relatively flat year-over-year. Q4, there might be a quarter of a difference.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Yee: Hi, good afternoon. I want to ask about how you're thinking about capital allocation in terms of debt repayment versus acquisitions. Is the leverage ratio coming down really just coming from EBITDA going up? Or are you planning to repay debt? And also how are you thinking about share repurchases?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: I would say that on the reverting the three times leverage is most likely a combination of both. So again, the debt that we assumed as a result of the US Ecology acquisition, paying down probably not all of it, but a portion of that, as well as just the growth in the underlying EBITDA dollars is certainly going to help the leverage calculation, but think of it as a combo of both.\nStephanie Yee: Okay.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Go ahead, if you just have a follow up question.\nStephanie Yee: Oh, sorry. I just going to -- I think you're going to comment on the share repurchases.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. As far as share repurchases. So, we were a buyer in the first quarter. We said that we are going to prioritize at this point the debt repayment, relatively short term outlook on that as far as 12 months or less. But we always remain opportunistic on repurchasing shares, and we will continue to do so.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. And if I can just ask one more question. I know you provided that free cash flow conversion target in 2024. You did really outright state and adjusted EBITDA margin target. But if we add in kind of the $40 million of cost synergies, are we looking at total company EBITDA margin kind of getting close to or above 30% over that same timeframe?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And I think that that's a realistic goal for us as we think about just through the cycle, being able to expand the EBITDA margin 30 to 50 basis points per year. So over that two-year periods you can see that that 30% is a realistic target.\nStephanie Yee: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the questions. First one is sort of guidance, housekeeping item. Does guidance contemplate the reinstatement of the CNG tax credit? And if you're not including it, what if that were to be renewed with the contribution be incremental in terms of EBITDA?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. No, we did not include that in the guide. We're going to wait until that's actually law at this point. For us, that's about a $15 million annual impact if it were to be fully reinstated.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, great. And then, you mentioned pricings exceeding internal cost inflation. Just looking at some of these cost line items. I mean, you're getting leverage in labor, in maintenance and repairs. I wonder if you could give us some color on how you're seeing the rate of internal cost inflation from 1Q to now 2Q and where do you think it goes in the back half of the year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We certainly, we come out with a annual wage increase in the first part of the year, obviously, for people. And as the market -- inflation has persisted and these markets have remained challenge, we've been going into select markets and putting in additional wages where we need to. And, again, we'll do whatever we need to do to retain our people who run the business forever, not for the quarter, not for the year on that front. So, that's certainly gone up from the first quarter, the second quarter. We now see kind of what we're doing with that flat lining throughout the rest of the year, kind of ending the -- end of the year with wage inflation in the high fours.\nNoah Kaye: Good. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Betsy. We are proud of our second quarter performance. We continue to manage the business to create long term value for all stakeholders. I would like to thank our 39,000 employees for their continued hard work and commitment to provide our customers with first-class service to create a more sustainable world. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and ability to harness the positive momentum in our business. We delivered outsize revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while generating underlying margin expansion. This was achieved by pricing in excess of our internal costs inflation and continued savings from productivity initiatives. The fundamentals in our business remain strong, and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace. During the second quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, which is a 21% increase over the prior year and produce more than $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year to date basis, which is a 14% increase over the prior year. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions, and returning cash to our shareholders. Year to-date, we invested $2.5 billion in acquisitions, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is well underway and progressing as planned. We're encouraged by early cross selling results, and remain confident that we will achieve at least $40 million of cost synergies. We have one of our most robust acquisition pipelines ever with opportunities to close transactions this year and into 2023. We now expect to invest over $600 million in acquisitions apart from US Ecology for the year. Substantially all of these deals are in the recycling and solid waste space. Year to date, we returned $495 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced an increase of the dividend for the 19th consecutive year. During the second quarter, we reported organic volume growth of 2.4%, which was broad based across geographies and market verticals. Simultaneously, we demonstrated our ability to price. Core price reached an all time high of 6.2%, an average yield increased to 5%. This is the highest level of pricing and company history. At the same time, we're experiencing higher than expected inflationary pressures that continue to persist. That said, we expect to continue to price more than our internal cost inflation, ultimately leading to full year results that are projected to exceed original expectations. We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $4.77 to $4.80, and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.725 billion. This represents an increase of approximately 4% from the midpoint of the prior guidance. Finally, we believe creating a more sustainable world is both our responsibility and a platform for growth. We've recently published our latest sustainability report, highlighting the progress we're making toward our most significant opportunities to positively impact key stakeholders and the environment. We reported a 9% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from our 2017 baseline, which keeps us well-positioned to achieve our interim target of a 10% reduction by 2025. We also highlight progress made on climate leadership goals, including circular economy, and renewable energy. These goals are supported by investments were making in Polymer centres and landfill gas projects, which are progressing as planned. In addition to having a positive impact on the environment, the innovative solutions are a platform for growth. Our efforts continue to be recognized externally, as Republic was recently named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the third consecutive year. I will now turn the call over to Brian who will provide details on the quarter. Generally, unplanned. Let's see -- very excited about the people. I think maybe one surprises we've been able to retain even a higher percentage of people than we expected. Again, there's good natural synergies in the deal we've talked about that. But the reason we bought this as a platform for growth, and we really respect their compliance culture, their expertise, and obviously a very unrivalled set of assets. And their team has been absolutely energized to get connected with us very strong cultural alignment. And we did a lot of work pre-merger in terms of organization structure and model and design. And we've got those teams staffed up and ready to go, and we're out moving in the marketplace. So, I'd say on balance. Its got a little more momentum than I expected at this point. Yes. I guess the one cautionary note, obviously, that we're living in very unique and uncertain times. And I think in the last 36 months have taught all of us some dose of humility. All that being said, the outlook from what we see right now is very, very positive. And so, you're right, the restricted portion of that book will continue to flow through. We're not going to change our stripes on the open market side of this business, right. We started, we lead with price. Our people deserve a fair wage increase. And that profit allows us to reinvest in the business and drive sustainability and all the things that we care about. So that won't change. And listen, I think we've got momentum on all three fronts. we've got momentum on the pricing side of the business. We've got momentum on the volume side of this business. And obviously, the acquisition activity, has also been very strong. And the rollover effect in the next year sets us up for what we think will end up being probably a double digit revenue year in 2023. Thank you. Yes. Stronger on both fronts. We're certainly stronger on the customer side, which leads to revenue on all fronts. It's a healthier customer mix. Again, I don't think that we talk enough about the economics of loyalty in this business. Every revenue dollars equals. Some customers are willing to stay with you longer. That's why core price is interesting, but yield becomes the ultimate pricing metric. And that's the one that really connects to the P&L, because it factors in the customer that you gain and lose. And you gain and lose those customers at very different rates with the same cost structure. So, yield becomes very important. So we've got the healthier customer base. We've got better tools, right and better technology that help us work with our local teams and price vary dynamically across all of our 300 plus market, so we feel better about that. And then we're more efficient. The rise of digital platform has been a big game changer for us. We've taken out $40 million of cost. And we think over the next 18 to 24 months, we got another $60 million to take out just in terms of driving efficiency and getting the same amount of work done in a shorter period of time. And so, where CPI goes? Listen, we've lived in all kinds of different environments here. I can tell you, it'd be really low, right. Doesn't work very well for the industry. And we've seen that period. The current number obviously isn't great either. Even though the results are good, we're out of balance as an economy, right with labor constraints and an unsustainable way where it's impacting consumer spending everything else. So modulating something into a 2%, 3%, 4%, I think you're going to find very healthy dynamics for our business, and really good performance. Hi, Tyler. Yes. So there's a couple of things that are a strategic review, right. And we'll announce those when we've taken a decision on those items. The vast majority of what we bought, we like, and we're going to keep and operate. And there's a couple of things that we're taking a look at that might not be the best fit, somebody else might be the natural owner. Yes. We certainly, we come out with a annual wage increase in the first part of the year, obviously, for people. And as the market -- inflation has persisted and these markets have remained challenge, we've been going into select markets and putting in additional wages where we need to. And, again, we'll do whatever we need to do to retain our people who run the business forever, not for the quarter, not for the year on that front. So, that's certainly gone up from the first quarter, the second quarter. We now see kind of what we're doing with that flat lining throughout the rest of the year, kind of ending the -- end of the year with wage inflation in the high fours. Thank you, Betsy. We are proud of our second quarter performance. We continue to manage the business to create long term value for all stakeholders. I would like to thank our 39,000 employees for their continued hard work and commitment to provide our customers with first-class service to create a more sustainable world. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "content": "Thanks Jon. Core price during the second quarter was 6.2%, which included open market pricing of 7.8% and restricted pricing of 3.5%. The components of core price included small container of 9.7%, large container of 6.9% and residential of 5.6%. Average yield on total revenue was 5%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points when compared to our first quarter performance. Average yield unrelated revenue was 5.4%. As Jon mentioned, we continue to dynamically adjust price on new and existing business to offset higher levels of cost inflation, we've seen our operating costs and capital expenditures. Second quarter volume increased 2.4%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 2.8%, an increase in large container of 2% and an increase in landfill of 5.7%. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 95%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $218 per ton in the second quarter. This compares to $170 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $260 million from the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On the same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the environmental solutions portion of our business was 17.1% during the quarter. This includes our existing operations in the Gulf and northeast together with the addition of US Ecology. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 29.6%. This compared to 30.6% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 140 basis point decrease from acquisitions of which 60 basis points relates to US Ecology, and a 110. basis point headwind from net fuel. It's important to note, that even though net fuel was diluted to margin, we recovered over 95% of the dollar change fuel expense through fuel recovery fees. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 60 basis point contribution from relatively higher incentive compensation expense in the prior year, and most importantly, underlying margin expansion of 60 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the solid waste and recycling business was 30.8%. SG&A expenses excluding transactions costs from US Ecology were 10% of revenue. The 70 basis point improvement demonstrates our ability to effectively manage costs and gain leverage while growing the business. With respect to our outlook, our guidance implies sequential growth and adjusted EBITDA dollars of 5% to 5.5% in the second half of the year compared to our first half performance. This would continue to drive double digit EBITDA growth on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.3%. The change in margin from our initial expectations relates to the impact of US Ecology and fuel. Year to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.15 billion and increased $143 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven exclusively by EBITDA growth in the business. Year to date capital expenditures of $505 million represents 35% of our projected full year spend, and year to-date cash taxes of $79 million represents approximately 25% of our projected full year spend. We now expect full year capital expenditures in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion. This represents an increase of $130 million from the midpoint of our prior expectations. The increase includes $75 million related to US Ecology. The remainder of the increase relates to investments to support growth, and higher than anticipated costs for trucks, equipment and landfill cell development. Total debt was $12 billion and total liquidity was $1.6 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.3 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage within the next 12 months. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 23.9% during the second quarter, and 24.6% on a year to-day basis. A lower than anticipated tax rate was mostly timing related, and provided a $0.05 EPS benefit during the first half of the year. We expect this timing benefit will flip in the second half, resulting in an equivalent tax impact of 29% in the third quarter, and 26% in the fourth quarter. We still expect a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 26%. With that operator, I would like to open the call for questions. Yes, strong. Because of that momentum on the pricing side, obviously, we're putting out more price than we ever have on the open market side and retaining at a higher percentage than we ever have. Which I think is a function of both the macro economy and inflation, and all costs going up for customers, as well as the fact that we continue to differentiate our service offering and provide something unique in the marketplace. And I don't see that changing for the remainder of the year. And then we'll get a nice pickup the second half of the year on the restricted side of the business. As those contracts kick in with underlying escalator something tied to CPI or CPI derivatives like average trash or water sewer trash, that will provide some momentum there as well. Yes. I think we talked about when we did the deal. This wasn't either or it was both end. And the timing of the deal was predicated on all the momentum we had in the traditional recycling and solid waste side of the business. And our outlook has never been stronger and more positive there for deals. I thought about what we're going to close this year and a strong pipeline in the next year. And that's where we certainly, the bulk of our acquisition spend will certainly come in that space. Now, the benefit is we've got a second platform with which we can pursue further follow-on and tuck-in acquisitions. And certainly we have a pipeline there. I think it's the only, I think it's very unlikely in the near term is we do another deal of scale in the environmental solution side of the business. Because we think we've got a great platform with US Ecology. We're building that out. Again, we'll be able to tuck in pieces along the way and in a very analogous way to the solid waste and recycling space of getting great post closure synergies on those deals as we pulled those right in. Yes, Jerry, specifically around some of the landfill gas projects and Polymer centres and things of that nature. Anything that's going to come online is really going to be in the latter part of 2023. So the contribution to 2023 is pretty limited with respect to those projects. Now, obviously, setting up 2024 and beyond, right, that's where it starts to get more exciting with respect to those investments. Really next year is more about pricing in excess of cost inflation, the realization of the synergies with US Ecology deal. I think the thing you have to remember, Jerry, is that on that restricted portion of our business and those indices that those contracts are tied to, they tend to lag. So again, when you take a look at what we're doing with the inflationary environment that we're experiencing today, and we're seeing that across our book, and we're able to drive underlying margin expansion this year, as we start to get those relatively higher price increases next year, we think that actually sets us up very well for continued margin expansion into 2023. Yes. The only the only caveat, I'd say is, I mean, the labor market remains constrained. And we do see some signs of that easing, right? And I would hope that that would continue to ease throughout the year, and create the opportunity in the next year, but we will do whatever. We want to run this business forever. So we'll do whatever we need to do to retain our people. So the level of margin expansion that we have in 2023 will be predicated on exactly how tight the labor market is and what we need to do with wages. Yes. Let me start on the wage piece. So we're -- listen, we're seeing inflation right in the high fours. And we feel good about that number in part, because going into this high inflationary period, we thought we had a very healthy cost structure. Healthy meaning not too high, but also not too low, right. Our team does a really good job of understanding local market dynamics. And we want to be the employer of choice in those markets. Now, obviously, we've had to take up, put wages into the market this year beyond our initial plan, just given the dynamic environment. And I would say, listen, we see that certainly flattening, and kind of ending the year into the high fours on that front. Assuming that inflation comes down, if that will start to modulate as we go forward. So I think we are past the peak of this thing with the caveat of we're living in uncertain environment. So Hamzah, within that 50% book that has a contractual pricing restriction, 34% of those are directly linked to CPI, 18% are some form of alternative index. So I think just over 50% has some inflationary component baked into it. And then the other 48% is some other pricing mechanism. So it could be a fixed rate. It could be a rate review or cost plus contract, but that's basically the composition of that 50% of our book. Sure. We value the deal, obviously, based on the standalone intrinsic value, plus $40 million of cost synergies. That being said, we think they're the revenue synergies over time will outpace that. Part of that is on the revenue synergies. So we've said, $75 million to $100 million of cross sell realized over three years. We've already gotten 15 of that. So very good early momentum on that front. And it's cutting both ways. Customers that US Ecology have that we're bringing in our services. But even more so customers that we have, we're now selling a broader set of services too. So we're in early days on that. We haven't really done a full rollout across all on our sales teams. So very excited about the momentum to hit that number. And then on pricing, we believe these are scarce assets. And again, you need to price to be able to reinvest in these assets over time and grow. And so, we put out a double digit price increase earlier this week that will go into effect in early September into the marketplace, because it's imperative that we do that. It's inflationary environment, right? We're going to reinvest in the business, and we're going to expand these margins over time. Yes. That's all solid waste, Michael. Agree. Well, let me start with the latter part first, when you want to talk about the dollars of EBITDA. So we talked for the full year, or I'm sorry, in the second half of increasing EBITDA 5% to 5.5% over our first half performance. So, I think first half was a $1.913 billion. Second half, that would imply $2 billion to $2.20 billion for a full year 3.91 to 3.93. So, when you take a look at that 5% to 5.5% sequential growth, of 3.5% of that is just the additional amount from US Ecology just for having that for longer in that period of time. And then the rest of the business 1.5% to 2%. When you think about that 1.5% to 2% on a like-for-like basis, that's relatively consistent what would we see in a normal year. And then, on your margin questions. So when you take a look at the 17.1% for the environmental solutions business, that's -- again, I would say there wasn't much that that we were able to affect in that period of time, it's only two months. So most of the synergy capture that we expect, the cross selling opportunities that Jon mentioned, and then again, the pricing opportunities, that's more on the come. So again, I would say that was more just the strength in the business from US Ecology, which could also be just reflective of strength in the industrial market. Thanks, Michael. Yes. So, we expect that with the -- the 5%, that we just reported here in the second quarter, we would expect, as we talked about that to accelerate in the second half of the year for the reasons we discussed, so we expect to stay over 5% for the balance of the year. So, full year that would average to right around 5% on a full year basis for average yield. And right now, when we take a look at volume, we're expecting that to be at the high end of our original guidance range. So right around 2%. Sure. Yes. You actually had a couple of those numbers there. So US Ecology is 70 basis points, 70 basis point drag from our original expectations. Net fuel is actually 50 basis points worse than we originally thought. We actually have 120 basis point drag between the two. And we're making that up with the rest of the business to get to that 29.3 for the year. Are you talking about just overall revenue? Or are you just talking about specifically around yield? Yes. Just a couple of things I want to clarify. So, when we're talking about core price and yield, that is on the solid waste business. That's what's included in those numbers. I want to point that out, because any change in environmental solutions revenue, whether it be price or volume is on a single line item when we sit there and reconcile the change in revenue. So, as we're talking about 5% yield, as you think about the sequential improvement from the CPI-linked contracts, we think to the second half of the year, that's probably about a 20 basis point increase or so in yield second half versus our second quarter performance, within a further step up, probably somewhere in that kind of mid fives as we sit there and look at 2023 [ph] today. Yes. So if you take a look at the total contribution from acquisitions, it's a 9.3%. Or that which is close, has close and that includes US Ecology. If you were to exclude US Ecology, that would be about 300 basis points. Yes. So including US Ecology that would also be about 300 basis points. Or, again, US Ecology plus deals close today. So overall, and we kind of talked about the cadence of average yield. And so, again, with a with a 5%, average yield than the second quarter, we see second half improving 15 to 20 basis points compared to our second quarter performance. And then as we look forward to 2023, again, assuming that things stay relatively stable on the open market portion of our business, that's where we think of average yield right now in kind of that mid 5%. overall Yes. A majority of that would be as we revert to that three times leverage, right, so we're going to reduce the interest expense. At the same time though capturing the synergies, that's all going to be a creative to both EBITDA margin as well as to free cash flow conversion. So, the combination really of the US Ecology integration, the reduction in interest expense over time, is that line of sight to that 47% free cash flow conversion. I think Q3 is relatively flat year-over-year. Q4, there might be a quarter of a difference. I would say that on the reverting the three times leverage is most likely a combination of both. So again, the debt that we assumed as a result of the US Ecology acquisition, paying down probably not all of it, but a portion of that, as well as just the growth in the underlying EBITDA dollars is certainly going to help the leverage calculation, but think of it as a combo of both. Go ahead, if you just have a follow up question. Yes. As far as share repurchases. So, we were a buyer in the first quarter. We said that we are going to prioritize at this point the debt repayment, relatively short term outlook on that as far as 12 months or less. But we always remain opportunistic on repurchasing shares, and we will continue to do so. Yes. And I think that that's a realistic goal for us as we think about just through the cycle, being able to expand the EBITDA margin 30 to 50 basis points per year. So over that two-year periods you can see that that 30% is a realistic target. Yes. No, we did not include that in the guide. We're going to wait until that's actually law at this point. For us, that's about a $15 million annual impact if it were to be fully reinstated."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks Stacey. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We had a strong start to the year which keeps us well-positioned to achieve our full year goals. The outcomes we're delivering reflect our focus on profitably growing, the recycling and solid waste business and expanding our environmental solutions business, so we can offer the most complete set of products and services to our customers. The investments we're making in the business are taking hold and creating undeniable value, while further strengthening our three differentiated capabilities of customer zeal, digital, and sustainability. During the first quarter, we delivered revenue growth a 14%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which is a 23% increase over the prior year and produced $531 million of adjusted free cash flow, which is a 14% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. Earlier this week, we closed the acquisition of US Ecology. This acquisition propels Republic into a leading position in the environmental solutions and adds a platform of high quality assets. We have customer overlap between our $1.5 billion manufacturing vertical and US Ecology's $1 billion book of business. We estimate our cross selling opportunity at $75 million to $100 million. We're excited to welcome US Ecology employees to the Republic team and will benefit from their deep expertise in specialty waste handling. We also invested $66 million in other acquisitions during the quarter. We also have approximately $400 million of deals in the advanced stages of closing, all of which are in the traditional recycling and solid waste space. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we returned $349 million to our shareholders, this includes $203 million in share repurchases and $146 million in dividends. We are experiencing meaningful traction developing our differentiated capabilities where actions are leading to outcomes. Our aspiration is to live in a world-class customer experience which we call Customer Zeal. Our customer retention rate remains at a record setting level of 95%. This has enabled us to generate the highest level of pricing retention and company history and generate outsized revenue growth throughout the business. During the first quarter, core price reached an all-time high of 6%, and average yield increased to 4.2%. Volumes increased 3.6% compared to the prior year and acquisitions contributed an incremental 390 basis points to total revenue growth. Regarding digital, we completed the rollout of RISE tablets in our small and large container fleet. We continue to see tangible benefits of this proprietary technology for our customers and within our operation. We will begin deploying tablets in the residential fleet later this month and expect to be complete by mid-2023. We recently went live with the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which will streamline back office activities and empower local leaders with enhanced data. Next, turning to sustainability. We continue to believe that environmental sustainability and economic sustainability go hand-in-hand. We are passionate about doing things that are good for the future generations in a way that generates profitable growth for our business. In March, the company announced our plans to expand our participation in the plastics value chain with a nation's first integrated plastics recycling facility. The Republic Services Polymer Center will address the growing demand for recycled plastics, while enabling CPG brands to meet their sustainability goals. Based in Las Vegas, this will be the first of three to five centers nationwide, and is scheduled to open in late 2023. We expect this polymer center will generate an incremental $50 million of revenue with an EBITDA margin at or above total company performance. Earlier today, we announced our joint venture with Archaea to develop 39 renewable natural gas projects that are landfills. These projects generate attractive returns and accelerate achievement of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goal of increasing biogas for beneficial reuse by 50%. The projects are expected to come online between 2023 and 2027, at which point approximately 70% of our total landfill gas collected will be beneficially reused. This joint venture together with our 17 landfill gas to energy projects under development are expected to generate approximately $100 million of incremental EBITA. We continue to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability, Republic Services was named a Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for the fourth time. I will now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Core price during the first quarter was 6%, which included open market pricing of 7.6% and restricted pricing of three and a half percent. The components of core price included small container of 9% large container of 6.8% and residential of 5.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 4.2%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. Average yield unrelated revenue with 4.5%. The outperformance and average yield is a direct result of higher core price increases in the face of more persistent cost inflation, dynamically adjusting rates for new work to match demand and increase price retention which illustrates customer willingness to pay for high value services. We expect average yields remain above 4% for the remainder of the year. First quarter volume increased 3.6%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 4.1%, an increase in large container of 4.6% and an increase in landfill of 4.7%. This level of volume performance was in line with our expectations. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $201 per ton in the first quarter. This compares to $133 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the first quarter. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $64 million from the prior year. This was driven by organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 30.4%. This compared to 30.7%. In the prior year, margin performance during the quarter included underlying margin expansion of 70 basis points and a 40 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, which was offset by a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 70 basis point decrease from recent acquisitions. Within the underlying business, we are seeing wage inflation of approximately 4%. price increase is more than offset this level of cost inflation before considering the impact from productivity improvements. SG&A expense excluding US Ecology deal and integration costs was 10.2% of revenue. This was flat with the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $531 million and increased $67 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million during the first quarter represents 15% of our projected full year spend, we remain on track to spend our full year budgeted capital expenditures. Total debt was $9.6 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25% during the first quarter. As Jon mentioned, we closed the acquisition of us ecology earlier this week. Our initial perspective on the contribution from us ecology for the remaining eight months of the year, is as follows revenue of approximately $720 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $130 million, which includes $5 million of realized synergies. We also expect EPS contribution to be flat to slightly positive. As a reminder, EPS includes the impact of intangible amortization, and relatively higher interest expense, as debt associated with the acquisition is expected to be highest during the first year. Annualized, this would represent a year one contribution of $1 billion of revenue, and approximately $170 million of EBITDA, which includes $10 million of first year synergies, we still believe there at least $40 million of cost synergies that will be realized during the first three years. We intend to incorporate the contribution from US Ecology into our full year guidance in July. Once the impact of purchase accounting is better known, and other areas subject evaluation are substantially complete. With that operator, I would like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon.\nJon Vander Ark: Good afternoon Tyler.\nTyler Brown: So, the landfill gas announcement, obviously pretty exciting. I think in your sustainability report, you guys already have something like 75 projects operating today. And if my math is right, which is always scary, but I think that maybe makes up a little more than half of the municipal solid waste landfills that you collect data on. So, number one, am I closest in the right ballpark? And two, this this deal with the 17 projects in development pretty much account for the remaining landfills in your fleet with enough ways to support a project, or some of these 39 at existing -- I'm going to call them, dirt gas operations, where you're upgrading to R&D [ph]?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, good question. So the 75, eight of those are solar projects. We put those together in our sustainability, portfolio is 67 today, right? We talked about another 17 in development, right? And then this project we announced with Archaea is another 39. Four of those projects of the 39 are basically recapping existing projects of the existing 67 I talked about, so it's mostly new and incremental. So, that kind of -- if you fast-forward to 2027, you got a few more that come become an inert, because that's the goal of the landfill, obviously, is to sunset it. So, that would take us from 67 today to 116 and 2027 with everything we're talking about.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. Yes, very helpful. And then just financially, what will we kind of see what you put up the money in one big chunk? Or do you do that as we go along? And then Brian would you just recognize it as like an income in non-controlling interest? And then they'll basically pay you a dividend back? Or how exactly what the mechanics were?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, no, we'll do it ratably investing, it's not just one big chunk, right into this joint venture. And then essentially, we get, you know, there's two forums of our return on that there's a royalty agreement, which is more typical of what we have on our typical projects, or existing projects, rather. And then we'll be in the minority equity investor in these and then Brian, you could talk about, we're going to hit the geographies.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So for the royalty similar to what we have today, Tyler, the royalty will just come through revenue, right. And you'll see that then most -- there's really no cost offsets, and most of that flows down to the EBITDA line item. And then for the portion where we've got that minority interest, that'll be a one line pickup, which will be -- again, it'll be included in our EBITDA, but it'll be separately distinguished so that you can actually see what its contribution is.\nTyler Brown: Okay, okay. That's helpful. Guys that\u2019s very helpful. Lastly, you're just -- we were kind of perusing the US Ecology tend to look like they kind of struggled this quarter that really pinched on cost. I think EBITDA was maybe down 10% year-on-year. So, what's the kind of the confidence around turning that business around quickly? I think you gave some color around the contribution, which seems like you're kind of expecting things to get a little bit better as the year plays out. But just maybe talk about the first 100 days there, what the plan is to really kind of get that this is turned for positive momentum?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, no, listen there first quarter was kind of right on what we had in the pro forma, right in terms of how we valued that businesses. And we're relatively conservative how we think about things. Integration begins now we had teams all over the country, welcoming our colleagues together. And frankly, it's been going on for weeks within the parameters of what we can do with DOJ and antitrust in terms of pre planning for the integration. So, we're already driving that through, we've got the four areas outlined, geographically, we've got those teams defined the leader and the Director for, right and where all the assets and divisions flow up through that. And so that includes integrating our own environmental solutions business into that. So, we took the best of best in terms of both, assets and people in terms of how those things are structured. So, we are well, on our way on that front. One of the big opportunities there is to integrate the great set of post collection assets that have with the field services, resources. And you know, COVID was kind of a trip up for them to be able to do that in a full way. And we've got the benefit of you know, not being out of COVID, but being in a very different stage of COVID. And so again, integrating those things together and, applying our considerable revenue management capabilities to that business, looking at the go-to-market approach, all those things are underway right now.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, one thing I would add to just on the performance in the first quarter, Tyler, as well as that the performance got better throughout the quarter.\nTyler Brown: Okay, and just real quickly, just to clarify, Jon, I thought you said $75 million to 100 million and $100 million and synergies and Brian said $40 million -- was just cost or what--?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, let me -- yes, the $40 million is just cost and like we value every deal, right? We have really understand the standalone intrinsic value of an enterprise and then right we value cost synergies, because we've got line of sight to that incremental to that $40 million, right, we see $75 million to $100 million of cross sell opportunities, right, probably realized over two and a half to three year period -- revenue, synergies, sorry. And then in addition to that, we've better than good any pricing. And we'll take a very hard look immediately, in terms of understanding that we're getting a return on all the work we do, and where there's an opportunity, especially in an inflationary environment, to make sure that we're getting our costs covered and more.\nTyler Brown: Right, right. Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. You mentioned the 4% wage inflation and that seemed really good for this environment and what we've heard from others. Can you give any color on maybe how you've been able to limit wage inflation if you've had any strategies around that et cetera?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I would say the seeds that were sown many years ago, right, we think about being a place where the best people come to work and making sure that our people get a fair increase every year. So even in very low inflationary environments, where CPI was running sub 1%, we always gave our people, a 2% to 3% increase in their wages, and the added benefits probably north of that. And so I would say, very fit and healthy cost structure coming in to this inflationary environment. And then we're very disciplined and surgical, we believe in market pay. And so we understand market pay and market dynamics, right across all the 800 dots on our map of where we operate. And so we've made individual indelible across the board kind of ratable cost of living increases every year. And then we go in and do additional moves, where we need to make sure that we're staying very competitive in the market. And we're still going through that, right. That's an ongoing process, ongoing science. And we believe in the local team. We also believe in the discipline and the expertise of our HR team. And we'll be able to do a centralized review, that we're doing things in a smart way. And I think you'll see us do some more of that in the third and fourth quarter here. All of which will result in a scale pricing ahead of our cost inflation of better productivity, which will allow us to expand our margins.\nToni Kaplan: That sounds great. I wanted to ask also on the renewable energy side, just given the really strong increase in gasoline and diesel prices, has that changed your approach to renewable energy projects? Has it caused any thoughts about pulling forward investments in new facilities or more alternative fuel vehicles? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, one of the reasons we're really excited about this joint venture as we think it allows us to get after a portfolio of landfills, right that we bid this out, and in a very competitive process, and really excited about our partner, but that we take on all of those projects, and those projects of varying returns. And some of those things, probably we wouldn't have independently gone after in a standalone basis, just given the size and scale. So, we're able to go deeper into our fleet of landfills with projects, which is exciting, we're also able to go faster, right, we can get after all 39 of these and the next, in addition to the 18 that we have in flight, or something we haven't flight, we feel really excited to be able to go after that opportunity that quickly because of that market. As it relates to fleet, we are long on electrification, about 20% of our fleet is CNG and we certainly have that as part of the portfolio. But all of our energy going forward is on electric vehicles.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hi. Thank you. And I also want to thank you for the very kind gesture you did a few weeks ago. I appreciate it. The 4% wage inflation, how does that translate into internal cost of inflation -- total internal cost inflation?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Relatively consistent, Michael, when you take a look -- I mean, I think just to put it into perspective, I talked about expansion in the underlying business of 70 basis points, I think you take that 4% cost inflation and compare that to that yield unrelated revenue, which is four and a half, and then you get, 10, 20 basis points of productivity, that is the expansion that we're seeing in the quarter.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. You anticipated part B of that. But I will ask you to RISE is fully rolled out in small and large container? Does it take that rate of productivity improvement and walk it up now, because you have it more comprehensively distributed? And then this is all about taking minutes out and lowering engine hours and the like?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, listen, when you first put it in, right you there's a little learning curve, and then you get your biggest wave of productivity improvement, right? When you can start to standardize the work and get the routing efficiently. And then in those existing sites, you just start to see incremental improvement over time. We're really happy about our productivity number this quarter. Given that we had a lot of the headwinds of traffic coming back, right people coming back to work society opening up and still be able to overcome that and still see some productivity is a great signal to us or indicator of what RISE is delivering was a we'll see this more in the residential fleet. And then as we go forward, there's a kind of a 2.0 of RISE of starting to get more into advanced analytics. How do we even take the analysts and build those routes more scientifically? How do we start to do more benchmarking across geographies, to understand what the true performance improvement opportunities are? And yes, I think you'll see steady radical improvement as we go forward.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And we the way we're looking at it right now, Michael, is that we probably have more opportunity left than we realized life-to-date.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it. And then last one on the landfill gas to energy development, you're putting up 27% of the capital? I'm assuming you control the gas and these other guys need the gas, they can't do what they want to do, even if they got a lot of money. So, what's the economic split?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: For that investment, we have a 40% ownership in the JV.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, and Jon, you've talked about that $100 million number over and over again, consistently, but it now looks like the whole thing is a lot bigger. Because I thought the $100 million related to your 17, you were developing, and now it were, or is this an incremental $100 million plus or $100 million for the 17?\nJon Vander Ark: No, this is $100 million total, Michael. So again, that -- the 17 was, call it about $25 million incremental. And then this new JV call it $75 million, for a total of $100 million for all 56 projects that are under development.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay.\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, keep in mind, Michael, these are -- we're into medium sized sites. So these are kind of, , sub 2,000 SCFM sites. And what we'll see over time is kind of randomly going through some of the legacy projects we have on bigger sites, they'll reach their natural end of -- the project needs to be recapped. Many times, it'll be electricity project that will take into RNG and then those will be bigger sites that will go into this joint venture.\nMichael Hoffman: Got it, All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Han [indiscernible] filling in for Hamza. So my first question is, could you just comment on the quarterly cadence of operating leverage and margin this year? And then just what your labor turnover is running versus pre-pandemic?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, let me take that, you know, the margin question here. So, again, if you take a look at the first quarter, and how we performed, what we see going forward, and we're on a sequential basis is that the fuel really started increasing in March, right now, we're kind of saying it's going to stay elevated. That's the assumption right now for the rest of the year. So sequentially, we see a 30 basis point headwind, from the impact of fuel. Now, we're also seeing better level of pricing. So we think that we can mostly offset that. But that margin would stay relatively flat, if you will, from our q1 performance, that's on the traditional recycling and solid waste space. If you then layer in the, you know, the US Ecology acquisition, that's going to create about a 70 basis point impact margin for the remainder of the year.\nJon Vander Ark: Labor -- in terms of labor turnover, but it's a little bit of a mixed picture, right, slightly elevated to pre-pandemic levels and some roles, certainly down and other roles. I'd say, look for the labor market remains tight, right? And that we would hire some more drivers, for sure, if we could get them and so back to running the business for the quarter of the year running it for the long-term. So, we're looking at all the markets and seeing where we have any elevated turnover understanding, right? If we need to put a little more wage into those markets, we will now wage is not always the answer as part of why people work. It's not all the reason why, it can be shift schedule, it can be their leader can be lots of things. So, we're very mindful of that. But again, we feel like we've got certainly a very good handle on inflation relative to pricing and our ability to cover our costs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, and then just, on the hazardous waste exposure, can you just talk about what that level of exposure is compared to what your portfolio is right now? And how big it could get, understanding of the solid waste portfolio will also grow? And then just, you know, if you could touch on the cyclicality of that hazardous waste business?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, I'd say hazardous, we didn't have any exposure. Technically, I think your question more broadly is environmental solutions versus recycling and solid waste. Right now, we got about a $400 million business in that space with the acquisition of US Ecology fast forward, that takes us to about $1.4 billion opportunity in that space. With a we think when the integrating field services and the post collection side of that it's got a relatively similar profile in terms of volatility in that space, and that there's a mix of project based work and a mix of recurring revenue, probably slightly higher, but when you mix the two parts of the business together, right doesn't meaningfully change our profile any respect. And in terms of growth prospects, we start with recycling and solid waste. We've never been more excited about our growth, growth prospects. They're both organically and through M&A. In addition, this platform with US Ecology gives us great geographic coverage and an opportunity to do follow-on tuck-in acquisitions to build out some product and service lines or to fill out a few smaller geographies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Good afternoon, everyone.\nJon Vander Ark: Hi, Jerry.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Hi, Jerry\nJerry Revich: Hi. I'm wondering, if you could just talk about on US Ecology, look, maybe it's too soon, but what's the nature of their landfill agreements? How quickly can you apply RSG's pricing mechanism to the landfill part of the business based on the contract structure? Is that something you're comfortable discussing on this call?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. Look, we are very well-run assets. So we start with compliance, right? Great compliance, a great set of assets, right, that are well maintained, great compliance culture, great compliance capability and technical capability that we've acquired with US Ecology. So we're really excited about that and that really is the foundation, right? That allows us to go to customers and offer them solutions that they're comfortable with that we \u2013 because they have producer liability, right? So we will maintain right, their waste streams in a way that is very compliant that they feel good about, that doesn't create liability for our customers that allows us then to price for the value that we're delivering to our customers. So we'll take a hard look at that. Again, we start with not the asset. We start with the customers, and we work our way back into the assets. And that begins right away, and it's a mix of contracted business in spot. And obviously, the spot, we can look at very quickly. The contractor side of that will take a little more time. But over time, you'll see, I think, steady improvement in that area.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And then on the RNG contracts, the $100 million assumption can you just touch on what that assumes in terms of gas price per MMBTU? And would you mind just commenting on if you have any off-take agreements at this point or how you're thinking about the opportunity set?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, the JV just got announced, right? And we haven't developed the project yet. So we don't have any agreements. But I can give you some of the assumptions, right? We've got pretty conservative assumptions about gas flow, which we think we could probably beat over time. This assumes a $2 Brent price. It will be a mix of fixed versus spot, probably more fixed than spot over time, but we'll decide what that looks like together.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Super. And lastly, can you talk about how you expect the pricing cadence to play out over the course of the second quarter based on actions that you've announced to customers? And if you can touch on, when you expect inflation to peak if you have that type of visibility?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Jerry, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect average yield to remain above 4%. Again, if you can take a look at the restricted portion of the business where we have those index-based price resets, 60% of our portfolio resets in the second half of the year. So if you can look for relatively consistent performance throughout the year, but I would sit there and say probably slightly higher in the second half than we saw in the first half.\nJon Vander Ark: Terrific. Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. If I look at your average yield to core price, I guess, conversion rate, I know that's not a great way to look at it. But that's been trending up nicely. You hit 70% in the first quarter here. And I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned retention at 95%. Does that suggest this is close to an upper bound of that conversion rate? Or are there are there things you can do to continue to narrow that gap?\nJon Vander Ark: There's certainly things we can do to improve it, which is just when we talk about our strategy around customer zeal and digital and sustainability, those are all things our customers value deeply, and we think are differentiated. And not every provider can offer that. And as we create a better offering, right, our customers are willing to pay more and stay longer. So that's the essence of what we do. Now there is a structural \u2013 there are things like people move, right, or businesses close. So there's things structurally, right, that I don't think we'll ever get to 100% loyalty. But at one point, we were sub 90% and then we got to 92%, and then we kept climbing the curve, and that's the aspiration to continue to get a little bit better because the offering is that much stronger. And as you know, the economics of loyalty in this industry are very, very strong. When customers stay longer, that's certainly very valuable for us.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. And there's two components to that calculation. There's retaining more but there's also pricing at a higher level for new business, right? Both of those go into the equation. So as we expand the environmental solutions business, as we have the most complete set of products and offerings. We think that we offer to our customers we have a better value proposition, and we can then charge more for those services from a new business perspective.\nKevin Chiang: Right. No, that makes sense. You're obviously seeing great momentum there. Just my second question, I think you mentioned earlier you're all in or at least you're focused on electric vehicles here. And I'm just wondering as a buyer of that technology, what do you think the bottleneck right now is for mass adoption? And I guess when you're evaluating what's in front of you, like what are the KPIs that matter the most? Is it just things like battery density? Or do things like supply chain resiliency given all that's happened in the past 9 months, like does that play a greater role? Or would you prefer a vendor that, for example, had vertically integrated their battery technology so that they're not dependent on somebody else, which creates execution risk on your orders? Just wondering how you kind of look at that evolution here.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. Well, good question. Both are relevant. Certainly, functionality, right, and the bottlenecks of weight and range, right? But for us, the operative metric is a truck has got to be able to deliver a full route in a day, right, without having a mid-day charge. That kind of creates the economics of it because whatever benefit you get, you burn up on productivity on a midday charge. And again, we feel very optimistic about where we're headed on that front. Of late, we are working really hard on some short-term exemptions with state and local municipalities. Again, I've already made some progress on that front as well, and I don't think that will be a hurdle or a barrier. We're very mindful of the supply chain with our partners to understand that, hey, what's our confidence in them being able to deliver this over time and obviously, the world has changed a lot in the last, not only two years, but the last 71 days. So we're cognizant of that and certainly baked that into our plans, but still all that being said, optimistic about the progress of starting to buy electric vehicles at scale within the next two and half, three years.\nKevin Chiang: Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, guys. Nice start to the year here. Would it be possible to drop the US Ecology outlook commentary to free cash flow both for this year and on an annualized basis?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Look, in these first couple of years, let's just take this year for example, we're thinking conversion in call it, the 20% range. And again, there's some elevated capital spending in particular with the landfill. We're building out landfill disposal capacity, which takes us into 2022 and 2023 that then modulates. And as we've talked about before, we still see 47% conversion as a consolidated company by 2024.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it, helpful. And maybe putting US Ecology aside, and just looking at stand-alone RSG, could you refresh any of the components of the year-over-year margin bridge for the full year? We had the $60 million to $70 million from pricing ahead of inflation. I think we had $50 million from normalizing incentive comp, and then that was offset by 40 basis points from net fuel and 40 basis points from acquisitions. Is there anything in that bridge you'd be able to refresh for us here?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. What I would probably say is that, the big things that change relative to our initial assumption is that fuel at current prices creates an additional 50 basis point headwind and think about pricing in excess of cost inflation offsetting that outside of US Ecology. So, relatively consistent expectation for the full year, just getting there a slightly different way.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks very much. I want to ask about some of the volume trends in the quarter. I know that the comps weren't too tough, but you did outperform, I think, relative to the industry. So I wonder if you could touch on what you're seeing in the markets. What are net new business trends? What are you seeing in terms of business formation? Where might have actually surprised a little bit to the upside on volumes in the quarter? And I guess the last part of that is, how much of this is really just being in the right markets? And how much of it is potentially attributable to share gains?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Look, I think you're still -- you're seeing this company of the country rather open up kind of post-COVID. And some of that we saw last summer, but some we didn't, I think, I mentioned this before California, right didn't really open up, because they were thinking about opening up the, Omicron variant have hit them, right. And we didn't see quite the lift -- see the lift, we do there. So you're certainly seeing some of that comeback. And that is, we're benefiting from our geographic footprint on that, including where our population is growing, right, our Sun Belt exposure helps, as you see people going into Texas, in Arizona and other places that at large volumes. And then listen to all of our investments into customer zeal and digital right are showing up in terms of organic growth. And that we\u2019re winning on the street. I think it's very tough to compete right now in a challenge labor environment. I think, there's some people on equipment challenges, right, given supply chain shortages. And we feel very good about our equipment deliveries, feel good about our team, but it is a tight labor market. So we would take more drivers if we could this place, but feel pretty good about how we're being able to sell them service customers.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Now that leads into my next question, which is on the M&A front, you mentioned, and they wanted to get last year, the $400 million of short-term potential pipeline. But what do you think about the current challenging operating environment in terms of its impact on M&A? We certainly seen some pretty healthy activities started the year. But how do you see that potentially affecting the pace and the pipeline of the M&A opportunity? Yeah, I think it remains strong. And we remain very encouraged about our outlook in that space. And as I think a number of things have helped us and probably helped the industry in the last three years, right. First, you had the fear around tax reform, and that driving some selling activity. You had COVID, and that making it a very challenging environment. And now you got an inflationary environment with a constrained labor market, where it's just getting tougher to compete, right? Add to that all the digital investments we're making at a scale that's very tough for other people to replicate, that are providing a better product to our customers. And I think that drives the opportunity for us to not only grow organically, but also have a very attractive M&A pipeline going forward.\nNoah Kaye: Great, thanks. Nice quarter.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio : Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Calleja with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Calleja : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I think you mentioned Ecology, I think it's 70 bps dilutive to margins for this year. How do we think about your margins now, as you guys integrate Ecology, especially this year? And in context of your 31%, 32% target getting back there, is pushing out a year? How can we kind of think about it with the integration now this business?\nBrian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So Mike, we're going to sit there and we are going to separate when we think about reporting, we're going to separate the environmental solutions space into its own segment. So as we think about the recycling and solid waste space, we have direct line of sight to that 32% margin. But this is structurally that the business is different on the environmental solution space, but we think there's opportunity. And so this is something where we'll take longer to get there on a consolidated company basis, sure. But we look at continual improvement, not only the realization of the synergies, the cost synergies, but as Jon mentioned, we didn't include any of the revenue synergies, whether it be any additional price into that performance. So, again, you'll be able to see the case, and we'll talk about our expertise [Technical Difficulty] as we provide annual guidance.\nMike Calleja : Perfect. That's helpful. And then just lastly, Brian, I think, eco reported $150 million of EBITDA in 2021. So the $130 million of EBITDA over the eight months, what level of organic growth are we assuming and the margins look like it's a little higher than last year? I might not be comparing apples-to-apples there. So any calls you can address on that pick up? And just lastly, I know I think Jerry asked earlier. I'm just curious, like, how does pricing work on this business? We know the restrictive and the CPI in the open market. And on the solid waste side curiously, if you can add color on, on how that kind of plays out on that environmental services book. Thanks, guys.\nBrian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So let me talk a little bit about the EBITDA. So again, there's seasonality in the business. So let's talk about what we're expecting for a full first year contribution on an equivalent. So before any synergies, we would sit there and say, we were expecting about $160 million worth of EBITDA that would compare to the 150 odd million that you were referring to. So that would be the year-over-year growth. We then layered in again, a full year would be about $10 million of first year synergies. What that means for the eight months based on the acquisition date, that's what translates into that $130 million of EBITDA, which includes $5 million worth of real life synergies.\nJon Vander Ark : And then, Mike on pricing, I think the best analog is think about the solid waste and recycling space. So you think about the post collection assets of U.S. Ecology and special waste, right? Those are event based deals, and special waste has some recurring streams. And it has some event based streams, if you're only in post collections, right? You're a taker in both of those, and you're typically giving more spot based pricing, sometimes more continuous streams are contracted, but contracted typically for shorter periods of time. And then the generator or the collector of those streams bids that out. The opportunity here is to integrate into field services, right, they have the assets, but driving that full integration, which allows you then to drive pricing from the customer, which drives more longer contracted and more consistency in the price, right, reduces the volatility of that demand. And so that is the focus right understanding generators of consistent streams of specialty waste, hazardous handling, and being able to supply them, right, and integrating that, right, into the landfills. And overtime again we saw this over a decade and a half. And it's always recycling space. That's how pricing power emanated is integrating those two things and not thinking about those two things as separate.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Yee: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask how the team came up with the $75 to $100 million of cross-selling opportunity. Specifically, is that kind of a realistic estimate, or is there conservatism in that number?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. So it was certainly bottom up. It wasn't a top down one. And we're in this space, right? We've been in big -- pretty big footprint in the Gulf Coast now for few years. Last year, we acquired ACB, which gave us a footprint in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. And so we're seeing it, right, we've already gone to market together. And we're seeing opportunities to serve customers, because we now have the broadest set of environmental services, products and services. And so customers -- bigger customers value that one stop shop offering, they want fewer suppliers in their facility, they like the assurance of what we can do with those materials. So we're seeing that winning in that space. We think we're used to ecology. Now you just have much bigger patch of land, right? We've got about a billion and a half manufacturing business. They're about a billion in revenue, right. And we lay that across in terms of number of customers and take a fairly conservative estimate in terms of the types of penetration we can get across that. That's how we came up with 75 million to 100 million.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And as Jon mentioned, the proof points have been there with the acquisitions that we've already done in our existing business to be able to see that that cross-sell opportunity is real.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. That's helpful. And if I can ask, now that you closed on the acquisition, do you feel comfortable talking about whether you would consider divesting any parts of U.S. ecologies business? Or whether that's even part of the consideration that you're evaluating down the line?\nJon Vander Ark: Sure, yes. There's a smaller international business, and they have a standby business. Both are good businesses. I think the question is, are we the national owners of those assets? So we'll start with international and put that under our view and understand, hey, how integrated is that? Whatever else we do and give it, get it, we're not an international player, right? We're North American player. We'll take a hard look there and the and the next level of I have to stay and -- again, we always start with a customer, what's the customer interaction and overlap and then we go into assets in terms of what we share in facilities, right, and then we'll get into the ability to disintegrate that sometimes it's something so tightly connected, right? It's tough to divest of that. But if it's unrelated on the customer side of the assets I typically answer is it's easier to devise that so we'll put both of those under review in that sequence and while we'll update you accordingly.\nStephanie Yee: Okay, okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Betsy. In closing, we are proud of our first quarter performance, which demonstrates the value our strategic investments are creating. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value for all stakeholders. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to partnering with customers to create a more sustainable world. We look forward to seeing everyone at Waste Expo next week, as we proudly recognize our four drivers of the year and celebrate Don Slager's well-deserved induction into the NWRA Hall of Fame. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

The outcomes we're delivering reflect our focus on profitably growing, the recycling and solid waste business and expanding our environmental solutions business, so we can offer the most complete set of products and services to our customers. The investments we're making in the business are taking hold and creating undeniable value, while further strengthening our three differentiated capabilities of customer zeal, digital, and sustainability. During the first quarter, we delivered revenue growth a 14%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which is a 23% increase over the prior year and produced $531 million of adjusted free cash flow, which is a 14% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. Earlier this week, we closed the acquisition of US Ecology. This acquisition propels Republic into a leading position in the environmental solutions and adds a platform of high quality assets. We have customer overlap between our $1.5 billion manufacturing vertical and US Ecology's $1 billion book of business. We estimate our cross selling opportunity at $75 million to $100 million. We're excited to welcome US Ecology employees to the Republic team and will benefit from their deep expertise in specialty waste handling. We also invested $66 million in other acquisitions during the quarter. We also have approximately $400 million of deals in the advanced stages of closing, all of which are in the traditional recycling and solid waste space. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we returned $349 million to our shareholders, this includes $203 million in share repurchases and $146 million in dividends. We are experiencing meaningful traction developing our differentiated capabilities where actions are leading to outcomes. Our aspiration is to live in a world-class customer experience which we call Customer Zeal. Our customer retention rate remains at a record setting level of 95%. This has enabled us to generate the highest level of pricing retention and company history and generate outsized revenue growth throughout the business. During the first quarter, core price reached an all-time high of 6%, and average yield increased to 4.2%. Volumes increased 3.6% compared to the prior year and acquisitions contributed an incremental 390 basis points to total revenue growth. Regarding digital, we completed the rollout of RISE tablets in our small and large container fleet. We continue to see tangible benefits of this proprietary technology for our customers and within our operation. We will begin deploying tablets in the residential fleet later this month and expect to be complete by mid-2023. We recently went live with the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which will streamline back office activities and empower local leaders with enhanced data. Next, turning to sustainability. We continue to believe that environmental sustainability and economic sustainability go hand-in-hand. We are passionate about doing things that are good for the future generations in a way that generates profitable growth for our business. In March, the company announced our plans to expand our participation in the plastics value chain with a nation's first integrated plastics recycling facility. The Republic Services Polymer Center will address the growing demand for recycled plastics, while enabling CPG brands to meet their sustainability goals. Based in Las Vegas, this will be the first of three to five centers nationwide, and is scheduled to open in late 2023. We expect this polymer center will generate an incremental $50 million of revenue with an EBITDA margin at or above total company performance. Earlier today, we announced our joint venture with Archaea to develop 39 renewable natural gas projects that are landfills. These projects generate attractive returns and accelerate achievement of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goal of increasing biogas for beneficial reuse by 50%. The projects are expected to come online between 2023 and 2027, at which point approximately 70% of our total landfill gas collected will be beneficially reused. This joint venture together with our 17 landfill gas to energy projects under development are expected to generate approximately $100 million of incremental EBITA. We continue to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability, Republic Services was named a Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for the fourth time. I will now turn the call over to Brian. Good afternoon Tyler. Yes, good question. So the 75, eight of those are solar projects. We put those together in our sustainability, portfolio is 67 today, right? We talked about another 17 in development, right? And then this project we announced with Archaea is another 39. Four of those projects of the 39 are basically recapping existing projects of the existing 67 I talked about, so it's mostly new and incremental. So, that kind of -- if you fast-forward to 2027, you got a few more that come become an inert, because that's the goal of the landfill, obviously, is to sunset it. So, that would take us from 67 today to 116 and 2027 with everything we're talking about. Yes, no, we'll do it ratably investing, it's not just one big chunk, right into this joint venture. And then essentially, we get, you know, there's two forums of our return on that there's a royalty agreement, which is more typical of what we have on our typical projects, or existing projects, rather. And then we'll be in the minority equity investor in these and then Brian, you could talk about, we're going to hit the geographies. Yes, no, listen there first quarter was kind of right on what we had in the pro forma, right in terms of how we valued that businesses. And we're relatively conservative how we think about things. Integration begins now we had teams all over the country, welcoming our colleagues together. And frankly, it's been going on for weeks within the parameters of what we can do with DOJ and antitrust in terms of pre planning for the integration. So, we're already driving that through, we've got the four areas outlined, geographically, we've got those teams defined the leader and the Director for, right and where all the assets and divisions flow up through that. And so that includes integrating our own environmental solutions business into that. So, we took the best of best in terms of both, assets and people in terms of how those things are structured. So, we are well, on our way on that front. One of the big opportunities there is to integrate the great set of post collection assets that have with the field services, resources. And you know, COVID was kind of a trip up for them to be able to do that in a full way. And we've got the benefit of you know, not being out of COVID, but being in a very different stage of COVID. And so again, integrating those things together and, applying our considerable revenue management capabilities to that business, looking at the go-to-market approach, all those things are underway right now. Yes, I would say the seeds that were sown many years ago, right, we think about being a place where the best people come to work and making sure that our people get a fair increase every year. So even in very low inflationary environments, where CPI was running sub 1%, we always gave our people, a 2% to 3% increase in their wages, and the added benefits probably north of that. And so I would say, very fit and healthy cost structure coming in to this inflationary environment. And then we're very disciplined and surgical, we believe in market pay. And so we understand market pay and market dynamics, right across all the 800 dots on our map of where we operate. And so we've made individual indelible across the board kind of ratable cost of living increases every year. And then we go in and do additional moves, where we need to make sure that we're staying very competitive in the market. And we're still going through that, right. That's an ongoing process, ongoing science. And we believe in the local team. We also believe in the discipline and the expertise of our HR team. And we'll be able to do a centralized review, that we're doing things in a smart way. And I think you'll see us do some more of that in the third and fourth quarter here. All of which will result in a scale pricing ahead of our cost inflation of better productivity, which will allow us to expand our margins. Yes, one of the reasons we're really excited about this joint venture as we think it allows us to get after a portfolio of landfills, right that we bid this out, and in a very competitive process, and really excited about our partner, but that we take on all of those projects, and those projects of varying returns. And some of those things, probably we wouldn't have independently gone after in a standalone basis, just given the size and scale. So, we're able to go deeper into our fleet of landfills with projects, which is exciting, we're also able to go faster, right, we can get after all 39 of these and the next, in addition to the 18 that we have in flight, or something we haven't flight, we feel really excited to be able to go after that opportunity that quickly because of that market. As it relates to fleet, we are long on electrification, about 20% of our fleet is CNG and we certainly have that as part of the portfolio. But all of our energy going forward is on electric vehicles. Yes, listen, when you first put it in, right you there's a little learning curve, and then you get your biggest wave of productivity improvement, right? When you can start to standardize the work and get the routing efficiently. And then in those existing sites, you just start to see incremental improvement over time. We're really happy about our productivity number this quarter. Given that we had a lot of the headwinds of traffic coming back, right people coming back to work society opening up and still be able to overcome that and still see some productivity is a great signal to us or indicator of what RISE is delivering was a we'll see this more in the residential fleet. And then as we go forward, there's a kind of a 2.0 of RISE of starting to get more into advanced analytics. How do we even take the analysts and build those routes more scientifically? How do we start to do more benchmarking across geographies, to understand what the true performance improvement opportunities are? And yes, I think you'll see steady radical improvement as we go forward. No, this is $100 million total, Michael. So again, that -- the 17 was, call it about $25 million incremental. And then this new JV call it $75 million, for a total of $100 million for all 56 projects that are under development. Hey, keep in mind, Michael, these are -- we're into medium sized sites. So these are kind of, , sub 2,000 SCFM sites. And what we'll see over time is kind of randomly going through some of the legacy projects we have on bigger sites, they'll reach their natural end of -- the project needs to be recapped. Many times, it'll be electricity project that will take into RNG and then those will be bigger sites that will go into this joint venture. Labor -- in terms of labor turnover, but it's a little bit of a mixed picture, right, slightly elevated to pre-pandemic levels and some roles, certainly down and other roles. I'd say, look for the labor market remains tight, right? And that we would hire some more drivers, for sure, if we could get them and so back to running the business for the quarter of the year running it for the long-term. So, we're looking at all the markets and seeing where we have any elevated turnover understanding, right? If we need to put a little more wage into those markets, we will now wage is not always the answer as part of why people work. It's not all the reason why, it can be shift schedule, it can be their leader can be lots of things. So, we're very mindful of that. But again, we feel like we've got certainly a very good handle on inflation relative to pricing and our ability to cover our costs. Well, I'd say hazardous, we didn't have any exposure. Technically, I think your question more broadly is environmental solutions versus recycling and solid waste. Right now, we got about a $400 million business in that space with the acquisition of US Ecology fast forward, that takes us to about $1.4 billion opportunity in that space. With a we think when the integrating field services and the post collection side of that it's got a relatively similar profile in terms of volatility in that space, and that there's a mix of project based work and a mix of recurring revenue, probably slightly higher, but when you mix the two parts of the business together, right doesn't meaningfully change our profile any respect. And in terms of growth prospects, we start with recycling and solid waste. We've never been more excited about our growth, growth prospects. They're both organically and through M&A. In addition, this platform with US Ecology gives us great geographic coverage and an opportunity to do follow-on tuck-in acquisitions to build out some product and service lines or to fill out a few smaller geographies. Hi, Jerry. Yeah. Look, we are very well-run assets. So we start with compliance, right? Great compliance, a great set of assets, right, that are well maintained, great compliance culture, great compliance capability and technical capability that we've acquired with US Ecology. So we're really excited about that and that really is the foundation, right? That allows us to go to customers and offer them solutions that they're comfortable with that we \u2013 because they have producer liability, right? So we will maintain right, their waste streams in a way that is very compliant that they feel good about, that doesn't create liability for our customers that allows us then to price for the value that we're delivering to our customers. So we'll take a hard look at that. Again, we start with not the asset. We start with the customers, and we work our way back into the assets. And that begins right away, and it's a mix of contracted business in spot. And obviously, the spot, we can look at very quickly. The contractor side of that will take a little more time. But over time, you'll see, I think, steady improvement in that area. Yeah, the JV just got announced, right? And we haven't developed the project yet. So we don't have any agreements. But I can give you some of the assumptions, right? We've got pretty conservative assumptions about gas flow, which we think we could probably beat over time. This assumes a $2 Brent price. It will be a mix of fixed versus spot, probably more fixed than spot over time, but we'll decide what that looks like together. Terrific. Thanks. There's certainly things we can do to improve it, which is just when we talk about our strategy around customer zeal and digital and sustainability, those are all things our customers value deeply, and we think are differentiated. And not every provider can offer that. And as we create a better offering, right, our customers are willing to pay more and stay longer. So that's the essence of what we do. Now there is a structural \u2013 there are things like people move, right, or businesses close. So there's things structurally, right, that I don't think we'll ever get to 100% loyalty. But at one point, we were sub 90% and then we got to 92%, and then we kept climbing the curve, and that's the aspiration to continue to get a little bit better because the offering is that much stronger. And as you know, the economics of loyalty in this industry are very, very strong. When customers stay longer, that's certainly very valuable for us. Yeah. Well, good question. Both are relevant. Certainly, functionality, right, and the bottlenecks of weight and range, right? But for us, the operative metric is a truck has got to be able to deliver a full route in a day, right, without having a mid-day charge. That kind of creates the economics of it because whatever benefit you get, you burn up on productivity on a midday charge. And again, we feel very optimistic about where we're headed on that front. Of late, we are working really hard on some short-term exemptions with state and local municipalities. Again, I've already made some progress on that front as well, and I don't think that will be a hurdle or a barrier. We're very mindful of the supply chain with our partners to understand that, hey, what's our confidence in them being able to deliver this over time and obviously, the world has changed a lot in the last, not only two years, but the last 71 days. So we're cognizant of that and certainly baked that into our plans, but still all that being said, optimistic about the progress of starting to buy electric vehicles at scale within the next two and half, three years. Yes. Look, I think you're still -- you're seeing this company of the country rather open up kind of post-COVID. And some of that we saw last summer, but some we didn't, I think, I mentioned this before California, right didn't really open up, because they were thinking about opening up the, Omicron variant have hit them, right. And we didn't see quite the lift -- see the lift, we do there. So you're certainly seeing some of that comeback. And that is, we're benefiting from our geographic footprint on that, including where our population is growing, right, our Sun Belt exposure helps, as you see people going into Texas, in Arizona and other places that at large volumes. And then listen to all of our investments into customer zeal and digital right are showing up in terms of organic growth. And that we're winning on the street. I think it's very tough to compete right now in a challenge labor environment. I think, there's some people on equipment challenges, right, given supply chain shortages. And we feel very good about our equipment deliveries, feel good about our team, but it is a tight labor market. So we would take more drivers if we could this place, but feel pretty good about how we're being able to sell them service customers. Thank you. And then, Mike on pricing, I think the best analog is think about the solid waste and recycling space. So you think about the post collection assets of U.S. Ecology and special waste, right? Those are event based deals, and special waste has some recurring streams. And it has some event based streams, if you're only in post collections, right? You're a taker in both of those, and you're typically giving more spot based pricing, sometimes more continuous streams are contracted, but contracted typically for shorter periods of time. And then the generator or the collector of those streams bids that out. The opportunity here is to integrate into field services, right, they have the assets, but driving that full integration, which allows you then to drive pricing from the customer, which drives more longer contracted and more consistency in the price, right, reduces the volatility of that demand. And so that is the focus right understanding generators of consistent streams of specialty waste, hazardous handling, and being able to supply them, right, and integrating that, right, into the landfills. And overtime again we saw this over a decade and a half. And it's always recycling space. That's how pricing power emanated is integrating those two things and not thinking about those two things as separate. Yes. So it was certainly bottom up. It wasn't a top down one. And we're in this space, right? We've been in big -- pretty big footprint in the Gulf Coast now for few years. Last year, we acquired ACB, which gave us a footprint in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. And so we're seeing it, right, we've already gone to market together. And we're seeing opportunities to serve customers, because we now have the broadest set of environmental services, products and services. And so customers -- bigger customers value that one stop shop offering, they want fewer suppliers in their facility, they like the assurance of what we can do with those materials. So we're seeing that winning in that space. We think we're used to ecology. Now you just have much bigger patch of land, right? We've got about a billion and a half manufacturing business. They're about a billion in revenue, right. And we lay that across in terms of number of customers and take a fairly conservative estimate in terms of the types of penetration we can get across that. That's how we came up with 75 million to 100 million. Sure, yes. There's a smaller international business, and they have a standby business. Both are good businesses. I think the question is, are we the national owners of those assets? So we'll start with international and put that under our view and understand, hey, how integrated is that? Whatever else we do and give it, get it, we're not an international player, right? We're North American player. We'll take a hard look there and the and the next level of I have to stay and -- again, we always start with a customer, what's the customer interaction and overlap and then we go into assets in terms of what we share in facilities, right, and then we'll get into the ability to disintegrate that sometimes it's something so tightly connected, right? It's tough to divest of that. But if it's unrelated on the customer side of the assets I typically answer is it's easier to devise that so we'll put both of those under review in that sequence and while we'll update you accordingly. Thank you, Betsy. In closing, we are proud of our first quarter performance, which demonstrates the value our strategic investments are creating. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value for all stakeholders. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to partnering with customers to create a more sustainable world. We look forward to seeing everyone at Waste Expo next week, as we proudly recognize our four drivers of the year and celebrate Don Slager's well-deserved induction into the NWRA Hall of Fame. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "content": "Thanks Jon. Core price during the first quarter was 6%, which included open market pricing of 7.6% and restricted pricing of three and a half percent. The components of core price included small container of 9% large container of 6.8% and residential of 5.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 4.2%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. Average yield unrelated revenue with 4.5%. The outperformance and average yield is a direct result of higher core price increases in the face of more persistent cost inflation, dynamically adjusting rates for new work to match demand and increase price retention which illustrates customer willingness to pay for high value services. We expect average yields remain above 4% for the remainder of the year. First quarter volume increased 3.6%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 4.1%, an increase in large container of 4.6% and an increase in landfill of 4.7%. This level of volume performance was in line with our expectations. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $201 per ton in the first quarter. This compares to $133 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the first quarter. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $64 million from the prior year. This was driven by organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 30.4%. This compared to 30.7%. In the prior year, margin performance during the quarter included underlying margin expansion of 70 basis points and a 40 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, which was offset by a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 70 basis point decrease from recent acquisitions. Within the underlying business, we are seeing wage inflation of approximately 4%. price increase is more than offset this level of cost inflation before considering the impact from productivity improvements. SG&A expense excluding US Ecology deal and integration costs was 10.2% of revenue. This was flat with the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $531 million and increased $67 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million during the first quarter represents 15% of our projected full year spend, we remain on track to spend our full year budgeted capital expenditures. Total debt was $9.6 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25% during the first quarter. As Jon mentioned, we closed the acquisition of us ecology earlier this week. Our initial perspective on the contribution from us ecology for the remaining eight months of the year, is as follows revenue of approximately $720 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $130 million, which includes $5 million of realized synergies. We also expect EPS contribution to be flat to slightly positive. As a reminder, EPS includes the impact of intangible amortization, and relatively higher interest expense, as debt associated with the acquisition is expected to be highest during the first year. Annualized, this would represent a year one contribution of $1 billion of revenue, and approximately $170 million of EBITDA, which includes $10 million of first year synergies, we still believe there at least $40 million of cost synergies that will be realized during the first three years. We intend to incorporate the contribution from US Ecology into our full year guidance in July. Once the impact of purchase accounting is better known, and other areas subject evaluation are substantially complete. With that operator, I would like to open the call for questions. Yes. So for the royalty similar to what we have today, Tyler, the royalty will just come through revenue, right. And you'll see that then most -- there's really no cost offsets, and most of that flows down to the EBITDA line item. And then for the portion where we've got that minority interest, that'll be a one line pickup, which will be -- again, it'll be included in our EBITDA, but it'll be separately distinguished so that you can actually see what its contribution is. Yes, one thing I would add to just on the performance in the first quarter, Tyler, as well as that the performance got better throughout the quarter. Yes, let me -- yes, the $40 million is just cost and like we value every deal, right? We have really understand the standalone intrinsic value of an enterprise and then right we value cost synergies, because we've got line of sight to that incremental to that $40 million, right, we see $75 million to $100 million of cross sell opportunities, right, probably realized over two and a half to three year period -- revenue, synergies, sorry. And then in addition to that, we've better than good any pricing. And we'll take a very hard look immediately, in terms of understanding that we're getting a return on all the work we do, and where there's an opportunity, especially in an inflationary environment, to make sure that we're getting our costs covered and more. Relatively consistent, Michael, when you take a look -- I mean, I think just to put it into perspective, I talked about expansion in the underlying business of 70 basis points, I think you take that 4% cost inflation and compare that to that yield unrelated revenue, which is four and a half, and then you get, 10, 20 basis points of productivity, that is the expansion that we're seeing in the quarter. And we the way we're looking at it right now, Michael, is that we probably have more opportunity left than we realized life-to-date. For that investment, we have a 40% ownership in the JV. Yes, let me take that, you know, the margin question here. So, again, if you take a look at the first quarter, and how we performed, what we see going forward, and we're on a sequential basis is that the fuel really started increasing in March, right now, we're kind of saying it's going to stay elevated. That's the assumption right now for the rest of the year. So sequentially, we see a 30 basis point headwind, from the impact of fuel. Now, we're also seeing better level of pricing. So we think that we can mostly offset that. But that margin would stay relatively flat, if you will, from our q1 performance, that's on the traditional recycling and solid waste space. If you then layer in the, you know, the US Ecology acquisition, that's going to create about a 70 basis point impact margin for the remainder of the year. Hi, Jerry Yeah. Jerry, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect average yield to remain above 4%. Again, if you can take a look at the restricted portion of the business where we have those index-based price resets, 60% of our portfolio resets in the second half of the year. So if you can look for relatively consistent performance throughout the year, but I would sit there and say probably slightly higher in the second half than we saw in the first half. You bet. Yeah. And there's two components to that calculation. There's retaining more but there's also pricing at a higher level for new business, right? Both of those go into the equation. So as we expand the environmental solutions business, as we have the most complete set of products and offerings. We think that we offer to our customers we have a better value proposition, and we can then charge more for those services from a new business perspective. Yeah. Look, in these first couple of years, let's just take this year for example, we're thinking conversion in call it, the 20% range. And again, there's some elevated capital spending in particular with the landfill. We're building out landfill disposal capacity, which takes us into 2022 and 2023 that then modulates. And as we've talked about before, we still see 47% conversion as a consolidated company by 2024. Yeah. What I would probably say is that, the big things that change relative to our initial assumption is that fuel at current prices creates an additional 50 basis point headwind and think about pricing in excess of cost inflation offsetting that outside of US Ecology. So, relatively consistent expectation for the full year, just getting there a slightly different way. Thanks. Yes. So Mike, we're going to sit there and we are going to separate when we think about reporting, we're going to separate the environmental solutions space into its own segment. So as we think about the recycling and solid waste space, we have direct line of sight to that 32% margin. But this is structurally that the business is different on the environmental solution space, but we think there's opportunity. And so this is something where we'll take longer to get there on a consolidated company basis, sure. But we look at continual improvement, not only the realization of the synergies, the cost synergies, but as Jon mentioned, we didn't include any of the revenue synergies, whether it be any additional price into that performance. So, again, you'll be able to see the case, and we'll talk about our expertise [Technical Difficulty] as we provide annual guidance. Yes. So let me talk a little bit about the EBITDA. So again, there's seasonality in the business. So let's talk about what we're expecting for a full first year contribution on an equivalent. So before any synergies, we would sit there and say, we were expecting about $160 million worth of EBITDA that would compare to the 150 odd million that you were referring to. So that would be the year-over-year growth. We then layered in again, a full year would be about $10 million of first year synergies. What that means for the eight months based on the acquisition date, that's what translates into that $130 million of EBITDA, which includes $5 million worth of real life synergies. And as Jon mentioned, the proof points have been there with the acquisitions that we've already done in our existing business to be able to see that that cross-sell opportunity is real."

We outpaced expectations throughout the year and deliver results that exceeded our full year guidance. During 2023, we achieved revenue growth of 11%, including 5% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, including margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.61; and produced $1.99 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions to further expand our business is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2023, including transactions in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The results we are generating are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal. Our efforts to provide industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score due to the value of our offerings and quality of our service delivery. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter with simultaneous increases in price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 40 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continued to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhanced warranty recovery. We expect to begin utilizing the new system in late 2024. The continued operational enhancements supported by our RISE digital operations platform are expected to drive additional productivity through improved route optimization and safety performance and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. We anticipate the RISE platform will drive approximately $100 million of total annual earnings contribution, of which approximately $65 million has been realized to date. We continue to implement advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and contamination and recycling containers. This technology is reducing contamination and driving incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remain on track. We are finalizing commissioning at our Las Vegas Polymer Center this week. Delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners is expected in the coming weeks. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Power Center. This development will be co-located with Blue Polymers production facility and construction at the site is expected to be completed in late 2024. The renewable gas projects being co-developed with our partners continue to advance. Five projects came online in 2023, and we expect at least eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 11 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect more than 50 additional EVs will be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We have six facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure, with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continue to strive to be a workplace with the best people from all background who want to work. In 2023, employee engagement improved a score of 86 with 90% -- 99% of employees participating in the survey. Turnover rates continue to turn lower with full year turnover improving 400 basis points compared to the prior year. As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth consecutive year. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and our ongoing investments to strengthen the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. With respect to 2024, we expect to deliver outsized profitable growth while continuing to make investments in the business to drive lasting value creation. More specifically, we expect full year revenue in a range of $16.1 billion to $16.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $4.825 billion to $4.875 billion. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.94 to $6, generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Our pipeline supports continued acquisition activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Our 2024 financial guidance includes the rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.2% in the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 10.6% and restricted pricing of 6%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.6% and residential of 8.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.3% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. In 2024, we expect average yield on total revenue in a range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect average yield on related revenue in a range of 6.5% to 7%. Yield is expected to step down sequentially during 2024 due to relatively lower index-based pricing and certain fees implemented throughout 2023, which begin to anniversary. Fourth quarter volume on total revenue increased 30 basis points and volume on related revenue increased 40 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 20 basis points and an increase in landfill of 7.4%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 12.7% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.4% and a decrease in landfill C&D volume of 2.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. In 2024, we expect organic volume growth in a range of flat to positive 50 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $131 per ton during the fourth quarter. This compared to $88 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. 2023 full year commodity prices were $117 per ton. This compared to $170 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $135 per ton, which is the baseline used in our 2024 guidance. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 19.7%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 29.9%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 230 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel, which was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, which represents margin expansion of 60 basis points, compared to the prior year. In 2024, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 30%. We expect to more than overcome a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Depreciation, amortization and accretion, was 10.7% of revenue in 2023 and is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue in 2024. Full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow was $1.99 billion, an increase of 14%, compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and the positive contribution from changes in working capital. Total debt at the end of the year was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.7 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2.9 times. We expect net interest expense of approximately $545 million in 2024. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the fourth quarter and 24.8% for the full year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2024, made-up of an adjusted tax rate of 20% and approximately $190 million of non-cash charges from equity investments in renewable energy. The expected increase in interest expense and taxes would result in a $0.20 EPS headwind in 2024. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about margins. In the fourth quarter, I know you mentioned a couple of factors, the commodities and fuel costs. But maybe just talk about how margins were so far ahead of the guide and what factors could continue into 2024, that could provide upside to the guidance there? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yes. Team had a really strong fourth quarter. Lots of things went in our favor, managed the middle of the P&L well. There were some one-time opportunities both on MSW and a very strong special waste fourth quarter. On that, that we felt good with, weather was actually very positive in the fourth quarter, which has slipped here in the first quarter of the year. So I feel great about that. And then, we've got a lot of momentum headed into 2023. Some of the event-based work, you can't build a budget against that, right? You've got to look at that as a potential upside, which we're going to go after those opportunities. But oftentimes, an election year, some of those jobs end up pushing and rolling forward. So we're not going to build a plan based on that outsized performance that we got in Q4, but still looking at a very positive year in 2024.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And Toni, we had mentioned all year long that we expected margin expansion to sequentially improve quarter-on-quarter, ending the year with the highest level of margin expansion compared to the prior year. So, that played out exactly as we thought. Now, the margin expansion itself was a little bit stronger than we originally anticipated. But ending the year with that type of performance and the type of margin expansion in the - over 200 basis points was in line with the way we thought it would end.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Wanted to ask about environmental services. Maybe just talk about what you're seeing in the different pieces there. And I think there's a little bit flattish in the quarter. So, does that turn around next year? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Most of the flatness is based on the comp. We had a really, really strong Q4 and 2022 that we were covering. Look, there is some slowdown in parts of that business, so rig counts are down, and that part of the opportunity in there. We've had a facility that we shut down to turnaround that we're going to reopen here in the middle of the year. So, that will provide some incremental lift, and that was closed in the fourth quarter. And then we continue to -- we'll trade price over volume where we need to. So, we've turned out some less profitable customers on that and feel really good about the book and the pipeline going forward.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong end of the year there. Maybe just on the 2024 guidance, the implied kind of 30, 40 basis points of margin expansion, reported market expansion you're guiding to. Is there a way to think about how that splits between solid waste and ES? Is it pretty balanced between the two? Or would you expect 1 to maybe outperform the other end as you look at into 2024 here?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Look, overall, I would sit there and say that we expect margin expansion in both of the business types. We're expecting just as -- when you take a look in basis points, a little bit more on the ES side, the Environmental Solutions side, but it is still relatively balanced between the two. Just given the sheer size of the recycling and waste business relative to the Environmental Solutions business, it will drive a majority of the overall expansion when you think about the enterprise taken as a whole.\nKevin Chiang: That's helpful. And maybe just my follow-up question. Just looking at the - your yield volume table that you provided in your disclosure. Just I noticed the strong yield in residential volumes, maybe a little bit worse than recent terms. Just wondering if you could provide some color in terms of what's happening there? And if you're -- as you mentioned earlier, are you maybe being more purposeful in shedding maybe lower quality volume to the benefit of good yield in the fourth quarter?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, we're always purposeful in trading our price versus volume. I'd say in this quarter, there was a couple of contracts that went out to bid that we did -- a rate that we thought was going to cover our costs and give us a fair return. We lost those opportunities. And then in previous quarters, we've had some nice wins, right? And these things come in fits and spurts. So, we didn't have anything in that quarter. That's really the combination of those two things drives the volume picture. On the pricing side, this is the manifestation of high CPI and the alternative indices over the last couple of years really flowing through our pricing, which is great to see. That's challenged part of the yield story historically and to see that number we were really pleased with.\nKevin Chiang: Excellent. I'll leave it there. Again, congrats on a good sets of results there.\nJon Vander Ark: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Please go ahead.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just following up on Tony's question. I think margins typically expect kind of quarter-over-quarter from 4Q to 1Q. I imagine that will be a little bit more flattish this year. Just if you can identify maybe some of the factors weighing 1Q margins or more broadly like why historical seasonality might not apply?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Bryan, what I would say is that when you talk about historical seasonality, I think you have to go back before just the last several years kind of post-pandemic. I think you have to look at a broader data set there. So -- when we came into this year, we said this year, we thought it was going to have what we would call a normal level of seasonality. And when you take a look at what that means, that would -- typically, when you look at margin performance, you would have peak margin performance in Q2 and Q3 during the summer months where you're getting some more of those seasonal volumes, in particular, on the landfill side followed by Q4. And then finally, the first quarter would seasonally be your lowest margin performance, and that's what we've seen for decades. And so we said that at the beginning of the year, that's kind of what played out. And that's what I would say we would also expect going into 2024 based on what we see right now. So, we would expect a sequential step down in margin from Q4 to Q1, in part, you've got more winter months when you're dealing with the first quarter as well as when you just think about some of the taxes, you have your highest burden from a labor perspective in the first quarter, and those tend to max out and as you move through the balance of the year, again, some of more of those state and local taxes, then those basically reach their max in the first quarter.\nJon Vander Ark: And we had weather, right? We had mild weather in Q4 of last year. We had pretty intense weather in January, where we've lost some certainly some haulage and some tons. Some of that will come back, but some of that will get pushed out through the remainder of the year. So that's what will lead to Q4 number that probably looks -- our Q1 number, that product is more flat than historically might have.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Got it. Thanks for all that detail. And then just following up on M&A, with the deals you completed in 4Q, did you provide a rough split for how that is divided up between the two segments? And did you provide a rollover contribution to 2024 revenue in guidance? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Roll over contribution will be about 200 basis points from deals closed in 2023 that will have a rollover impact into 2024. Just on the split from a revenue active, it was about $200 million on the environmental solutions of the annualized revenue acquired in the fourth quarter, and about $140 million on the recycling waste side.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Thanks a lot. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead,\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to follow-up on M&A here. A big year for you in terms of deals done, I think, $1.86 billion they're acquired. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on, first of all, what the pipeline looks like going forward, particularly relative to such a large year this past year. And then second is in terms of integration, will you be focusing a bit more given how big the year was in 2023 on integration and perhaps put a little bit on -- touch a little bit on how that integration is going? Or do you see room and capacity to continue at a fairly heavy space pace here in terms of M&A for 2024.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, we look at two things. Obviously, the strategic fit and the financial return on any type of deal, and we're going to stay disciplined on both of those things. Are we the natural owner? And does it meet our expectation in terms of cash and cash returns. And then we do think about our ability to absorb it unless we have a lot of capacity across the enterprise. We wouldn't necessarily do a couple of big deals in the in the same part of the country at the same time because the local team does play a pretty strong role in that day-to-day integration activity.  Last year was the product of our normal tuck-ins, which we've done forever, and those are very value creating. It's hard to do those deals poorly because we've done it for so long. And then some nice kind of medium-sized deals. we build a plan, right, anticipated what those medium-sized dealers are going to be there, not that we're not pursuing it, but you just don't know when they're going to move or when they're going to come. So, that's predicated on step down in our expectation this year for what we\u2019ve done. It's not because the pipeline is weaker -- pipeline is strong, but we never know exactly what we're going to close, and we're going to stay disciplined. \nWalter Spracklin: Got it. That's great color. And just for my follow-up, turning to recycling. I know your Las Vegas Polymer Center opened in December. Can you talk a bit about the build-out on the polymer center -- and I don't know if you've had enough time now to assess, but do you see this as a better investment than kind of -- or not better, but how do you -- how does that compare to EPR projects in terms of the return profile of that one?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're very satisfied with both the execution and the return. We're pretty conservative in terms of our financial modeling leaving ourselves room and we feel very good about the demand in the marketplace, we could have sold out Las Vegas five times over upfront. And the pricing expectations are ahead of what we modeled. So the returns are going to come in, again, ahead of our expectations on that front. And that's certainly given us confidence as we talked about in the prepared remarks to go to Indy, and then we're planning on at least two more across the country.\nWalter Spracklin: Fantastic. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question is from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nJohn Mazzoni: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one on pricing. Could you just remind us how the restricted book will layer through 2024especially with sort of the lag effects in CPI? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, one of the things I mentioned with respect to the cadence from a pricing perspective in my prepared remarks is we do expect a sequential step down in the level of pricing throughout the year, primarily due to the impact that, that index pricing will have. So again, we expect to report the highest level of average yield in Q1 and the lowest level in Q4 with a step down in between. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, when you take a look at the two primary components that may make up our basket that are related to some sort of index, one being headline CPI and then the other being the alternative indices. And when you take a look at headline CPI, right, it saw its peak in June of 2022, and has been stepping down sequentially since. Water, sewer, trash and garbage trash saw peak levels in August of 23 and have been stepping down since then. Now, that said, the water sewer trash and garbage trash still remain at elevated levels, water sewer trash the recent print was 5.5% and garbage trash was 6.4%. So we're still pretty pleased about the level, but it is going to sit there and step down just due to the math.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great. Thank you. And maybe for a quick follow-up. Could you just talk to the strength in small container, especially with the 11.2% yield? It seems like that's kind of update the average? And any other thing you're seeing within that kind of end market and any other commentary around anything different that you've done compared to peers? Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yes, we rolled out some new technology around AI, which helps us spot contamination and also helps us assess overages when the containers are overfilled. And that certainly contributed to the small container performance. Again, underlying pricing was great, but that put it on top. And that's why we talked about our 2024 number. We expect to anniversary that in the second half of the year, so that will come down a bit.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, guys. I've always challenged for that full cycle, people, whatever. So free cash flow and the guide is at about 7% in the midpoint versus the top line at 7.9% and EBITDA is at $9.1 million. I'm presuming we've got higher interest expense and probably higher cash taxes because you're not counting on bonus depreciation being retroactively reverted back to 100%. Is that how I think about the bridge between the growth rates through the P&L?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: That's correct, Michael. If you just take taxes alone, when you take a look at two components. So one, we are assuming that the current loss stays in place, which means bonus depreciation we'll sit there and have a further headwind 2024 compared to 2023. Combined with the settlement we had with the IRS in 2023, where we received $20 million of cash back to a matter that dates back to 2017. Combined, those two create a $45 million headwind in cash taxes, that alone is a 2.3% headwind to year-over-year growth on free cash flow. So you just take taxes alone and you'd sit there and say you'd be kind of 9.5% growth in free cash flow or not for the impact of taxes. Interest, to your point, would just is going to be a further.\nMichael Hoffman: All right. And that was what I was trying to get at. Is the underlying cash growth is there and you've got some timing issues related to What we just discussed? Okay. On margin\u2026\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And Michael, to that point, from an underlying business perspective, the growth in free cash flow is double digit.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. Okay. That's, I think, important. And then on margins, I think there's another sort of message to potentially to be drawn out. So your pattern in your solid waste business, given the shield scale of managing price costs as you're being pretty ratably able to deliver all 30 basis points. So, if the whole company is doing 30 and you've got an M&A headwind and act environmental comes in is a nice add in ES, but it's probably pretty dilutive. So how do we think about that EES to dilution? It's much better structurally ex that dilution is what I think, which--\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Just to give you a perspective, if you look across, right, both business types, we're expecting 30 basis points of dilution from acquisitions. And we would expect dilution from an acquisition perspective in both recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions. If you're looking at the underlying business itself within ES, we're expecting over 100 basis points of margin expansion in the Environmental Solutions business due to the underlying business itself.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. And about 30 in solid waste and then a net in the total company dilution, but it's greater in ES than it is in solid waste. It's just one size of the deal relative to the base?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: That's correct.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Okay. I think that's important to draw that, you're still on that track of 25% or better margins at ES, ex acquisitions and the acquisitions will then contribute to that as you integrate them?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Okay. Cool. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks Jon. Can you talk to us about this new asset management system that you're putting in place? What are you functionally doing? And where does that ultimately show up in the P&L? Is it maintenance and repairs? What kind of savings are we talking about with the system?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. It's really the RISE platform. Think about digitizing our operations from our logistic operation all the way through our fleet and how our drivers operate every day. But this brings this to the maintenance shop. And so, now rather than moving paper around, right, when the driver does their vehicle condition report before they take off in the morning that digitally flows and is recorded into the maintenance organization. So they're dealing with tablets as well. So they're getting out of the paper-based business. And a big driver of that is the productivity benefit to that for sure, but then there's also the warranty recovery element of that. Because when you're chasing paper that becomes a very manual process, when you could do this digitally, it allows you to quickly understand but warranty is available? Are you fully claiming all the parts that are warranty eligible and allowing us to get full recovery?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. When you think about the linkage, so a couple of years ago, we started on our journey of modernizing our core systems, and that started with our general ledger and procurement systems. This is an extension of that. So the asset management system will be directly linked and integrated on a common platform with our procurement system. So, now you can sit there and say, from the point of PO all the way to putting something on a truck, you can sit there and you can track that part. So to Jon's point on warranty management, this is something before we had to do very manually, which means that we had a lot of leakage in the system. Now, we feel very confident that we're going to get every single portion of that warranty that we're entitled to.\nNoah Kaye: Very nice. Just a quick housekeeping one. You've already detailed the expectations for yield through 2024. But just your comments around weather, tough volume comps for 1Q and you just mentioned the weather flipped to be a little bit of a drag here to start we all felt that cold. So how do we think about kind of the volume trends Q-to-date and how that trends through the year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Look, I mean, the good news, right, is that while January, we did experience quite a bit of weather, we have seen most of that volume return, not a total recovery, but we saw what we would expected in February so far to-date. We're guiding to flat to 50 basis point positive Q1, may be kind of the low point of that because of the weather. But I would think of it relatively ratable that type of cadence throughout the year.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And in an environment where your yield is decelerating year-over-year at a pretty, pretty shallow step down, you can get the market expansion that we're looking for without a lot of volume contribution. So, you let the value of the upside to where margins came from? So, the basic take way.\nJon Vander Ark: Correct.\nNoah Kaye: All right. Thanks very much. I will hand over. \nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nStephanie Moore: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Hi, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: Hey, there. I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the underlying macro environment, probably a decent follow-up to the prior question. You called out some weakness in the quarter on landfill C&D volumes. I don't think any of us would be really surprised to hear that. But maybe any other areas you might be seeing weakness or other levels of strength of the opposite? And then what is the kind of the underlying macro assumption embedded in the 2024 guidance? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I think the picture is mixed. So again, we're planning on having a strong year. If you think about the direct things, we talked about weather, certainly housing, interest rates being high, mortgage rates being high, housing activity is certainly a byproduct or depressed housing activity as a byproduct to that. So, we would have hoped for a quicker recovery there, both for our business and because we need more homes in the United States, but we think that will be more delayed towards the later end of the year. So we're not planning a robust recovery on that front. And then if you think about the other macros, the manufacturing, I think, is a mixed picture. We see pockets where while we're winning business, there's some service declines in certain subsectors of manufacturing, but other places in terms of remediation projects and other things have been very, very strong. PFAS is a nice contributor to the business in 2023, and we've got a good pipeline in 2024. And then the macro have two wars going on, right, one in Israel, one in the doorstep of Europe. Credit card debt is high with consumers. So we have a cautious kind of macro perspective on that but the underlying demand signals for our business are largely positive.\nStephanie Moore: Great. No, that's helpful. And then you touched on this a little bit, but if you could kind of walk through kind of what you've seen from the cost inflation standpoint, clearly getting better, but some of those clear headwinds that we saw through most of 2023, kind of how those are trending now to start 2024? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, certainly stepping down operating labor, clearly stepping down year-over-year. Transportation is stepping down. Maintenance has been a little bit stickier and most of that is the fact that we're growing and we're driving a fleet that's aging just because the supply chain is still a little congested and we're not getting all the trucks that we wanted. And it's really been a three-year phenomenon in that front. So, we're going to catch up some in this year, but we're not going to fully catch up on that. And all that is when you're driving a 12, 13-year-old truck, right, with a kind of a peak cycle in terms of its maintenance versus a new truck that has relatively high warranty recovery, and so therefore, very low maintenance cost, that's going to show up in the underlying maintenance bucket. So that spend will be, we think, elevated throughout the year. We hope we do a little better, but we'll speak.\nStephanie Moore: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I would just love to continue the conversation on the cost side. I mean, really impressive in the quarter, your cost per unit were up just 1% year-over-year. So, I'm wondering where are you starting to see deflation. It sounds like the tailwind from better equipment availability still in front of us. So I'm wondering what's gotten better for you folks already in the fourth quarter numbers? And then Brian, I'm wondering if you just put a finer point on the comments that you made about yield slowing over the course of the year on comps. Do you expect to exit the year with price cost spread still favorable fourth quarter versus fourth quarter? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Yes, Jerry, so Jon mentioned one of them already is our labor has continued to improve, right, really throughout the year. In part, that's just due to a reduction in turnover, right, that we've seen. And so again, when you just take a look at the impact that turnover has, there's a hiring cost of bringing someone else, well, which is a productivity impact. A newer driver just tends not to be as productive as those that have some tenure. And so we're starting to see as the turnover rates have come down. We're seeing that kind of come through that labor line item, which has had a positive impact. So I would say that's where we've seen some of the biggest improvements. Together, we mentioned throughout the year, some of the impact that transportation cost it had, these were things where we had multiyear agreements. They came up for renewal in the second half of 2022. And we said that we took some pretty big price increases and that they were going to comp out in the second half of 2023. And we've certainly seen that. So I would say those are some of the tailwinds we've seen it from a cost perspective. The maintenance has stayed relatively sticky in kind of that 7% to 8% type cost increase range year-over-year. To your question just on the price/cost spread, I would say the say we expect the biggest or the most positive impact between that in the first quarter. We expect that to modulate throughout the year, but still price exceeding cost by the time we exit 2024.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Super. And then nice progress on a $100 million efficiency program, how much progress did you make in 2023 specifically and the remaining $35 million of productivity improvement -- when do you expect -- how much of an improvement do you expect in 2024 relative to that remaining $35 million?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Approximately about $10 million or the main $35 million.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist. Please go ahead.\nJack Wilson: Yes. Good evening. This is Jack Wilson on for Tobey. Can we double click on sort of the state of the fleet and specifically fleet electrification in the long-term and sort of where you see that going?\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that -- we right now, we'll have a $50 million to that this year. We'll be at several hundred next year and climbing our path, that's going to start in residential, and then it will move into small container overtime. And we've got a really thoughtful strategy in terms of how we roll that out. I mentioned the infrastructure side of that as well it's not just a truck, right? It's a system. So you need to understand the infrastructure. You need to understand the incentives. You need to understand the customer or willingness to pay for the vehicle. And if we feel the trucks that we've had delivered out of our partnership with OshKosh, those trucks are working very, very well. So we're excited to see the next 50 come into the fleet.\nJack Wilson: Okay. Thank you for that color there. And then just as a follow-up, can we sort of dig into the moving parts of volume? Are there any sort of specific geographies or market segments that are especially volatile or changing?\nJon Vander Ark: No, I mentioned the housing piece, large-container temp. That's been certainly soft, as we're not putting up as many new houses as we need and even for Movement, People are kind of keeping their existing mortgage rates and are reluctant to move. And oftentimes, we see move we see remodeling activity or other ancillary opportunities and large container temp, and that's been muted. We don't think that will last forever here, but we're planning on a relatively benign year this year, looking to 2025 to see that accelerate.\nJack Wilson: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. Please go ahead.\nTony Bancroft: Thanks for the question. Nice job on the quarter. Just some more color maybe you mentioned PFAS remediation. Could you just maybe talk about what is going on currently at your landfills or whatever you're doing regarding PFAS and what could that maybe just a general idea what could that business look like opportunity-wise going forward?.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We think we've got a very compelling offering for customers in an end-to-end solution. So we can hand all the way from the assessment to the frontline remediation doing our field service work and then a range of disposal options on the back end, whether that's into hazardous landfill, whether that's in deep well, some of that waste can be profiled and then put into a solid waste landfill as well, and you're seeing some of that flow through our special ways. So that's measured in the tens of millions. If you look at last year -- this year, it will be the high end of tens of millions or potentially tipping into a nine-digit number in terms of revenue. So this is a real growth opportunity for us. And this is all mostly people self-selecting in advance of the EPA regulations coming down as well as some of the Department of Defense work that's been accelerated on that front. So we feel like our national footprint positions us well to -- in our strategic accounts organization positions us very well to serve customers on this issue.\nTony Bancroft: That's great. And then maybe switching to trucks. You talked about what's going on with EVs and the amount of deliveries coming, which sounds great. Any issues with maybe on traditional trucks and EVs on supply chain, getting those deliveries? And then just to piggyback on that one. It surprises you see any surprises in EV performance. You hear read a lot of things about how it's performing. Obviously, you're pretty well situated just based on the routing system. But just some real-time color on how those -- I guess there's only a few right now, but that's going to be growing, and I'm sure you've done a lot of testing.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. The supply chain is -- again, we're probably getting about 80% of the trucks we want over the last couple of years. And that includes the rollover from the previous year, right? So we're not continuing to fall way behind, but we haven't fully caught up yet either. But keep in mind, we've grown a lot. We're coming off our third straight year of double-digit revenue growth on that. So as we grow and do these acquisitions, that creates more demand and need for new trucks. So we see that slightly improving. I think we'll get -- we'll sort and that we'll shrink that gap as we exit 2024. I don't expect that we'll close that gap until 2025 on that front And then the EV specifically, the McNeilus truck is the first purpose-built refuse truck ever and it's electrified. And that truck is driving a full route. Most of the other EVs that we've piloted that you spend the first 60 days with a lot of software issues that you're working through, we've been really, really surprised by the performance level and the uptime of this vehicle. Working through some bugs. We're still in a test and learn environment but really promising in terms of what this is going to be able to do to operate at scale with EV.\nTony Bancroft: Thank you so much. Great job.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jon Vander Ark for any closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Debbie. I would like to recognize and thank our more than 40,000 employees for their great work and commitment to serving our customers. Their efforts enabled our strong 2023 results and the continued growth of our company. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year and deliver results that exceeded our full year guidance. During 2023, we achieved revenue growth of 11%, including 5% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, including margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.61; and produced $1.99 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions to further expand our business is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2023, including transactions in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The results we are generating are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal. Our efforts to provide industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score due to the value of our offerings and quality of our service delivery. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter with simultaneous increases in price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 40 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continued to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhanced warranty recovery. We expect to begin utilizing the new system in late 2024. The continued operational enhancements supported by our RISE digital operations platform are expected to drive additional productivity through improved route optimization and safety performance and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. We anticipate the RISE platform will drive approximately $100 million of total annual earnings contribution, of which approximately $65 million has been realized to date. We continue to implement advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and contamination and recycling containers. This technology is reducing contamination and driving incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remain on track. We are finalizing commissioning at our Las Vegas Polymer Center this week. Delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners is expected in the coming weeks. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Power Center. This development will be co-located with Blue Polymers production facility and construction at the site is expected to be completed in late 2024. The renewable gas projects being co-developed with our partners continue to advance. Five projects came online in 2023, and we expect at least eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 11 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect more than 50 additional EVs will be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We have six facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure, with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continue to strive to be a workplace with the best people from all background who want to work. In 2023, employee engagement improved a score of 86 with 90% -- 99% of employees participating in the survey. Turnover rates continue to turn lower with full year turnover improving 400 basis points compared to the prior year. As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth consecutive year. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and our ongoing investments to strengthen the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. With respect to 2024, we expect to deliver outsized profitable growth while continuing to make investments in the business to drive lasting value creation. More specifically, we expect full year revenue in a range of $16.1 billion to $16.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $4.825 billion to $4.875 billion. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.94 to $6, generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Our pipeline supports continued acquisition activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Our 2024 financial guidance includes the rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year. Sure. Yes. Team had a really strong fourth quarter. Lots of things went in our favor, managed the middle of the P&L well. There were some one-time opportunities both on MSW and a very strong special waste fourth quarter. On that, that we felt good with, weather was actually very positive in the fourth quarter, which has slipped here in the first quarter of the year. So I feel great about that. And then, we've got a lot of momentum headed into 2023. Some of the event-based work, you can't build a budget against that, right? You've got to look at that as a potential upside, which we're going to go after those opportunities. But oftentimes, an election year, some of those jobs end up pushing and rolling forward. So we're not going to build a plan based on that outsized performance that we got in Q4, but still looking at a very positive year in 2024. Yes. Most of the flatness is based on the comp. We had a really, really strong Q4 and 2022 that we were covering. Look, there is some slowdown in parts of that business, so rig counts are down, and that part of the opportunity in there. We've had a facility that we shut down to turnaround that we're going to reopen here in the middle of the year. So, that will provide some incremental lift, and that was closed in the fourth quarter. And then we continue to -- we'll trade price over volume where we need to. So, we've turned out some less profitable customers on that and feel really good about the book and the pipeline going forward. Yes, we're always purposeful in trading our price versus volume. I'd say in this quarter, there was a couple of contracts that went out to bid that we did -- a rate that we thought was going to cover our costs and give us a fair return. We lost those opportunities. And then in previous quarters, we've had some nice wins, right? And these things come in fits and spurts. So, we didn't have anything in that quarter. That's really the combination of those two things drives the volume picture. On the pricing side, this is the manifestation of high CPI and the alternative indices over the last couple of years really flowing through our pricing, which is great to see. That's challenged part of the yield story historically and to see that number we were really pleased with. Great. Thanks. And we had weather, right? We had mild weather in Q4 of last year. We had pretty intense weather in January, where we've lost some certainly some haulage and some tons. Some of that will come back, but some of that will get pushed out through the remainder of the year. So that's what will lead to Q4 number that probably looks -- our Q1 number, that product is more flat than historically might have. Yes, we look at two things. Obviously, the strategic fit and the financial return on any type of deal, and we're going to stay disciplined on both of those things. Are we the natural owner? And does it meet our expectation in terms of cash and cash returns. And then we do think about our ability to absorb it unless we have a lot of capacity across the enterprise. We wouldn't necessarily do a couple of big deals in the in the same part of the country at the same time because the local team does play a pretty strong role in that day-to-day integration activity.  Last year was the product of our normal tuck-ins, which we've done forever, and those are very value creating. It's hard to do those deals poorly because we've done it for so long. And then some nice kind of medium-sized deals. we build a plan, right, anticipated what those medium-sized dealers are going to be there, not that we're not pursuing it, but you just don't know when they're going to move or when they're going to come. So, that's predicated on step down in our expectation this year for what we've done. It's not because the pipeline is weaker -- pipeline is strong, but we never know exactly what we're going to close, and we're going to stay disciplined. Yes. We're very satisfied with both the execution and the return. We're pretty conservative in terms of our financial modeling leaving ourselves room and we feel very good about the demand in the marketplace, we could have sold out Las Vegas five times over upfront. And the pricing expectations are ahead of what we modeled. So the returns are going to come in, again, ahead of our expectations on that front. And that's certainly given us confidence as we talked about in the prepared remarks to go to Indy, and then we're planning on at least two more across the country. Sure. Yes, we rolled out some new technology around AI, which helps us spot contamination and also helps us assess overages when the containers are overfilled. And that certainly contributed to the small container performance. Again, underlying pricing was great, but that put it on top. And that's why we talked about our 2024 number. We expect to anniversary that in the second half of the year, so that will come down a bit. Yes. It's really the RISE platform. Think about digitizing our operations from our logistic operation all the way through our fleet and how our drivers operate every day. But this brings this to the maintenance shop. And so, now rather than moving paper around, right, when the driver does their vehicle condition report before they take off in the morning that digitally flows and is recorded into the maintenance organization. So they're dealing with tablets as well. So they're getting out of the paper-based business. And a big driver of that is the productivity benefit to that for sure, but then there's also the warranty recovery element of that. Because when you're chasing paper that becomes a very manual process, when you could do this digitally, it allows you to quickly understand but warranty is available? Are you fully claiming all the parts that are warranty eligible and allowing us to get full recovery? Correct. Hi, Stephanie. Yes, I think the picture is mixed. So again, we're planning on having a strong year. If you think about the direct things, we talked about weather, certainly housing, interest rates being high, mortgage rates being high, housing activity is certainly a byproduct or depressed housing activity as a byproduct to that. So, we would have hoped for a quicker recovery there, both for our business and because we need more homes in the United States, but we think that will be more delayed towards the later end of the year. So we're not planning a robust recovery on that front. And then if you think about the other macros, the manufacturing, I think, is a mixed picture. We see pockets where while we're winning business, there's some service declines in certain subsectors of manufacturing, but other places in terms of remediation projects and other things have been very, very strong. PFAS is a nice contributor to the business in 2023, and we've got a good pipeline in 2024. And then the macro have two wars going on, right, one in Israel, one in the doorstep of Europe. Credit card debt is high with consumers. So we have a cautious kind of macro perspective on that but the underlying demand signals for our business are largely positive. Yes, certainly stepping down operating labor, clearly stepping down year-over-year. Transportation is stepping down. Maintenance has been a little bit stickier and most of that is the fact that we're growing and we're driving a fleet that's aging just because the supply chain is still a little congested and we're not getting all the trucks that we wanted. And it's really been a three-year phenomenon in that front. So, we're going to catch up some in this year, but we're not going to fully catch up on that. And all that is when you're driving a 12, 13-year-old truck, right, with a kind of a peak cycle in terms of its maintenance versus a new truck that has relatively high warranty recovery, and so therefore, very low maintenance cost, that's going to show up in the underlying maintenance bucket. So that spend will be, we think, elevated throughout the year. We hope we do a little better, but we'll speak. Sure. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that -- we right now, we'll have a $50 million to that this year. We'll be at several hundred next year and climbing our path, that's going to start in residential, and then it will move into small container overtime. And we've got a really thoughtful strategy in terms of how we roll that out. I mentioned the infrastructure side of that as well it's not just a truck, right? It's a system.

And if we feel the trucks that we've had delivered out of our partnership with OshKosh, those trucks are working very, very well. So we're excited to see the next 50 come into the fleet. No, I mentioned the housing piece, large-container temp. That's been certainly soft, as we're not putting up as many new houses as we need and even for Movement, People are kind of keeping their existing mortgage rates and are reluctant to move.

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.2% in the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 10.6% and restricted pricing of 6%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.6% and residential of 8.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.3% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. In 2024, we expect average yield on total revenue in a range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect average yield on related revenue in a range of 6.5% to 7%. Yield is expected to step down sequentially during 2024 due to relatively lower index-based pricing and certain fees implemented throughout 2023, which begin to anniversary. Fourth quarter volume on total revenue increased 30 basis points and volume on related revenue increased 40 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 20 basis points and an increase in landfill of 7.4%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 12.7% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.4% and a decrease in landfill C&D volume of 2.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. In 2024, we expect organic volume growth in a range of flat to positive 50 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $131 per ton during the fourth quarter. This compared to $88 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. 2023 full year commodity prices were $117 per ton. This compared to $170 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $135 per ton, which is the baseline used in our 2024 guidance. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 19.7%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 29.9%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 230 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel, which was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, which represents margin expansion of 60 basis points, compared to the prior year. In 2024, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 30%. We expect to more than overcome a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Depreciation, amortization and accretion, was 10.7% of revenue in 2023 and is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue in 2024. Full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow was $1.99 billion, an increase of 14%, compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and the positive contribution from changes in working capital. Total debt at the end of the year was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.7 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2.9 times. We expect net interest expense of approximately $545 million in 2024. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the fourth quarter and 24.8% for the full year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2024, made-up of an adjusted tax rate of 20% and approximately $190 million of non-cash charges from equity investments in renewable energy. The expected increase in interest expense and taxes would result in a $0.20 EPS headwind in 2024. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Yes. And Toni, we had mentioned all year long that we expected margin expansion to sequentially improve quarter-on-quarter, ending the year with the highest level of margin expansion compared to the prior year. So, that played out exactly as we thought. Now, the margin expansion itself was a little bit stronger than we originally anticipated. But ending the year with that type of performance and the type of margin expansion in the - over 200 basis points was in line with the way we thought it would end. Yes. Look, overall, I would sit there and say that we expect margin expansion in both of the business types. We're expecting just as -- when you take a look in basis points, a little bit more on the ES side, the Environmental Solutions side, but it is still relatively balanced between the two. Just given the sheer size of the recycling and waste business relative to the Environmental Solutions business, it will drive a majority of the overall expansion when you think about the enterprise taken as a whole. Yes. Bryan, what I would say is that when you talk about historical seasonality, I think you have to go back before just the last several years kind of post-pandemic. I think you have to look at a broader data set there. So -- when we came into this year, we said this year, we thought it was going to have what we would call a normal level of seasonality. And when you take a look at what that means, that would -- typically, when you look at margin performance, you would have peak margin performance in Q2 and Q3 during the summer months where you're getting some more of those seasonal volumes, in particular, on the landfill side followed by Q4. And then finally, the first quarter would seasonally be your lowest margin performance, and that's what we've seen for decades. And so we said that at the beginning of the year, that's kind of what played out. And that's what I would say we would also expect going into 2024 based on what we see right now. So, we would expect a sequential step down in margin from Q4 to Q1, in part, you've got more winter months when you're dealing with the first quarter as well as when you just think about some of the taxes, you have your highest burden from a labor perspective in the first quarter, and those tend to max out and as you move through the balance of the year, again, some of more of those state and local taxes, then those basically reach their max in the first quarter. Yes. Roll over contribution will be about 200 basis points from deals closed in 2023 that will have a rollover impact into 2024. Just on the split from a revenue active, it was about $200 million on the environmental solutions of the annualized revenue acquired in the fourth quarter, and about $140 million on the recycling waste side. Yes, one of the things I mentioned with respect to the cadence from a pricing perspective in my prepared remarks is we do expect a sequential step down in the level of pricing throughout the year, primarily due to the impact that, that index pricing will have. So again, we expect to report the highest level of average yield in Q1 and the lowest level in Q4 with a step down in between. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, when you take a look at the two primary components that may make up our basket that are related to some sort of index, one being headline CPI and then the other being the alternative indices. And when you take a look at headline CPI, right, it saw its peak in June of 2022, and has been stepping down sequentially since. Water, sewer, trash and garbage trash saw peak levels in August of 23 and have been stepping down since then. Now, that said, the water sewer trash and garbage trash still remain at elevated levels, water sewer trash the recent print was 5.5% and garbage trash was 6.4%. So we're still pretty pleased about the level, but it is going to sit there and step down just due to the math. That's correct, Michael. If you just take taxes alone, when you take a look at two components. So one, we are assuming that the current loss stays in place, which means bonus depreciation we'll sit there and have a further headwind 2024 compared to 2023. Combined with the settlement we had with the IRS in 2023, where we received $20 million of cash back to a matter that dates back to 2017. Combined, those two create a $45 million headwind in cash taxes, that alone is a 2.3% headwind to year-over-year growth on free cash flow. So you just take taxes alone and you'd sit there and say you'd be kind of 9.5% growth in free cash flow or not for the impact of taxes. Interest, to your point, would just is going to be a further. And Michael, to that point, from an underlying business perspective, the growth in free cash flow is double digit. Just to give you a perspective, if you look across, right, both business types, we're expecting 30 basis points of dilution from acquisitions. And we would expect dilution from an acquisition perspective in both recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions. If you're looking at the underlying business itself within ES, we're expecting over 100 basis points of margin expansion in the Environmental Solutions business due to the underlying business itself. That's correct. Yes. Yes. When you think about the linkage, so a couple of years ago, we started on our journey of modernizing our core systems, and that started with our general ledger and procurement systems. This is an extension of that. So the asset management system will be directly linked and integrated on a common platform with our procurement system. So, now you can sit there and say, from the point of PO all the way to putting something on a truck, you can sit there and you can track that part. So to Jon's point on warranty management, this is something before we had to do very manually, which means that we had a lot of leakage in the system. Now, we feel very confident that we're going to get every single portion of that warranty that we're entitled to. Look, I mean, the good news, right, is that while January, we did experience quite a bit of weather, we have seen most of that volume return, not a total recovery, but we saw what we would expected in February so far to-date. We're guiding to flat to 50 basis point positive Q1, may be kind of the low point of that because of the weather. But I would think of it relatively ratable that type of cadence throughout the year. Yes. Yes, Jerry, so Jon mentioned one of them already is our labor has continued to improve, right, really throughout the year. In part, that's just due to a reduction in turnover, right, that we've seen. And so again, when you just take a look at the impact that turnover has, there's a hiring cost of bringing someone else, well, which is a productivity impact. A newer driver just tends not to be as productive as those that have some tenure. And so we're starting to see as the turnover rates have come down. We're seeing that kind of come through that labor line item, which has had a positive impact. So I would say that's where we've seen some of the biggest improvements. Together, we mentioned throughout the year, some of the impact that transportation cost it had, these were things where we had multiyear agreements. They came up for renewal in the second half of 2022. And we said that we took some pretty big price increases and that they were going to comp out in the second half of 2023. And we've certainly seen that. So I would say those are some of the tailwinds we've seen it from a cost perspective. The maintenance has stayed relatively sticky in kind of that 7% to 8% type cost increase range year-over-year. To your question just on the price/cost spread, I would say the say we expect the biggest or the most positive impact between that in the first quarter. We expect that to modulate throughout the year, but still price exceeding cost by the time we exit 2024. Approximately about $10 million or the main $35 million."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks Aaron. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Our strong third quarter results reflect our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while generating healthy margin expansion across our business. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 6%, including 2% from acquisitions, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% and expanded EBITDA margin by 70 basis points, report adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 and produced $1.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we have invested $947 million in acquisitions. All transactions were in the recycling and waste space. The M&A environment remains active with opportunities in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We remain confident that we will exceed $1 billion of investment for the year. Year-to-date, we returned $671 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes $201 million of share repurchases completed during the third quarter as our leverage ratio returned to target levels. We continue to make progress, demonstrating the value of our complete set of products and offerings to customers while increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in the Environmental Solutions business remains strong, and we continue to drive organic growth through cross-selling. EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved sequentially to 22.7% in the third quarter and expanded 390 basis points over the prior year. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy in support of our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal, our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by our valuable service offerings and quality service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter, with simultaneous increases in both price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.2%, and organic volume growth and related revenue was 10 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route optimization, further improved safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. For example, we now have the ability to provide real-time customer notifications regarding expected service time on a given day. We are in the early stages of deploying advanced contamination over time and drive incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in areas such as plastic circularity and renewable natural gas or a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers remains on track. Construction of our Las Vegas Polymer Center is substantially complete, and we expect full scale operations to begin in November. Our Midwest Polymer center will be located in India. This center will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility with operations expected to begin in late 2024. The renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners are continuing to advance. I projects were online by the end of the third quarter, and we expect eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We are making progress in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We expect to have 12 electric vehicles in operation by year-end and more than 60 EVs to be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We now have 6 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development. We continue to be recognized as an employer of choice and are proud to be certified as a great place to work for the seventh consecutive year. Our team members remain highly engaged to ensure that we are delivering high-quality essential services that are valued by our customers. I now turn the call over to Brian, who'll provide more details for the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%. Core price on related revenue was 8.6% and which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12% and large container of 8.6% and residential of 8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.2%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue and related revenue increased 10 basis points. The component of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 50 basis points and an increase in landfill of 3.5%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.2% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.7% and a decrease in landfill C&D volumes of 6.2%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $112 per ton during the quarter. This compares to $162 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 20 basis points during the quarter. We continue to see a steady recovery in fiber markets and plastics pricing has improved from recent lows. Our current average commodity price is approximately $120 per ton. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $8 million over the prior year. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.7% and an increase of 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 29.9%. Margin performance during the quarter included margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points and a 30 basis point increase from one less workday. This was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions, a 20 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point decrease from net fuel. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year capital expenditures and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date net capital expenditures of $935 million represents 56% of our projected full year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $152 million represents approximately 60% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $12 billion, and total liquidity was $2.3 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 21.4% during the third quarter. The relatively lower tax rate included a $20 million favorable tax settlement from previous tax years, which added $0.06 of EPS during the quarter. We now expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 24.5% for the full year. As noted in our earnings press release, we upwardly revised our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.49 primarily as a result of the lower tax rate. We remain comfortable achieving the other components of full year financial guidance that we provided in July. I will now turn the call back to Jon. Actually, we're going to open it up for Q&A.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, let me do one more section, please. We are proud of the results we delivered during the third quarter. Healthy contribution from our pricing strategy more than offset recycled commodity headwinds and cost inflation, which continues to moderate. Looking forward to 2024, we expect continued outsized growth in the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses, supported by pricing ahead of underlying costs, cross-selling our complete set of products and services and capitalizing on value-creating acquisition opportunities. We also expect financial contribution from the investments made in sustainability innovation, including plastic circularity and renewable natural gas projects. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow along with margin expansion. We plan to provide detailed guidance on our earnings call in February. Now with that, operator, I would like to turn it over for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Not looking for guidance in 2024, but just maybe, if you could just provide some initial thoughts on pricing, maybe on the separated into open market and restricted, how those should hold up? Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. We're not providing guidance today, obviously, on 2024, but we expect \u2013 the outlook is positive. So I think about high to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, and we'll grow free cash flow and EBITDA margin faster than that, and that gets to your pricing question, we just -- pricing will come down nominally as inflation comes down, but we'll still be pricing ahead of our cost inflation, which should lead to that formula where we're going to grow the bottom line a little faster than the top line.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And then just thinking about some of the expense drivers. We've heard from peers and from you as well in prior quarters that the equipment availability has been a little bit better, that retention has been improving. Is there any way to size some of those benefits? Just trying to think about those on a go-forward basis. Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: We're certainly \u2013 we talked about cost inflation modulating in the second half, and we're certainly seeing that. So you can see that in some of the cost categories, labor, maintenance, certainly a bright spot. The supply chain there, maybe getting incrementally better, but still, we're not going to get all the trucks we want this year. But I think if you see the improvement in the maintenance, that really speaks to the underlying cost of parts inflation has certainly improved versus the first half. And we expect those costs to continue to modulate into next year as well.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Please go ahead.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, Brian, apologies if I missed this, but when I look at the EBITDA and free cash flow bridge is provided in the press release, it seems like net income kind of steps up consistent with the tax rate changes we've talked about. But it maybe doesn't flow through to cash. Just wondering what I might be missing? Is it maybe a change to an adjusted number on how your cash taxes, is there changes to working capital? Any detail you could provide would be great.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Look, as you mentioned, we raised the full year EPS guidance predominantly due to the relatively lower tax rate. There is a cash component to that as well. That is somewhat offset by relatively higher interest rates than we normally thought, which is flowing through to cash interest, and that's why your adjusted free cash flow remains relatively consistent with what we previously provided.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Thanks for that detail And last question for me. I'm just wondering if you can maybe try to characterize the M&A market within Environmental Solutions. You've obviously been very busy with acquisitions, but we haven't seen any deals and yes yet. I'm just wondering if M&A is a little bit slower than you developed or if everything is moving along and maybe it just comes down to timing? Thanks gentlemen.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, it really comes down to timing. The pipeline is strong, lots of opportunities, lots of conversations. And we remain incredibly disciplined in terms of our financial strategic lens and our financial lens on that, but we feel certainly optimistic through the remainder of the year and into the first half of next year that there's a number of attractive opportunities in that space.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: So Brian, I think restricted pricing actually accelerated again to 5 7 here in Q3. Do you think that this is going to prove the high watermark, or do you think we get maybe one more quarter of acceleration? And then we kind of hit that second derivative?\nJon Vander Ark: I think we're near it, quite honestly, Tyler here. Again, we talked about the relationship between CPI-based pricing starting to step down, but water sewer trash and garbage trash stepping up. And right now, I think they're somewhat offsetting each other. We think that to the question earlier about as you look forward, we do think that the restricted base pricing does step down sequentially 2024 from 2023, but again, it still stays above that longer-term average.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then -- so Jon, I think last quarter, there was some talk about kind of hitting a ceiling in certain places in ES with some of the pricing actions. It said that you were -- you kind of said that you were moving forward on that front. But just curious if you can give us an update there. Is pricing good in ES? Are you starting to see some churn. And just are you seeing any impacts from the economy in that business specifically?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. No, pricing remains strong. We certainly remain committed on that. There's sort of that's a customer churn on that portfolio. Some of that's permanent work, some of that is event work, and we're trading off some low-margin work, and we're adding to that very attractive cross-sell work. And so lots of really attractive growth opportunities in that space, but we're never going to do work for free, and we're always going to start out with price on that. So in the macro environment in manufacturing and ES broadly is a bit mixed. So the upstream oil and gas has been slower. Hopefully, a couple of big deals announced here that, that will ignite some increased activity there in Q4 and into next year. Automotive, obviously, has been a little bit challenged here with the labor activity. But then other parts of the petrochemical complex have been very, very strong. And overall, we're happy with the results and still feel very positive going into 2024 in terms of the demand environment.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. And just my last one here, a couple of housekeeping items. But based on what we know today, what is the expected M&A rollover benefit next year? And then based on what we know today with the RNG and the polymers, what is the incremental benefit to 2024 EBITDA from those?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So first on the rollover, based on transactions that have closed to date, that'd be about 50 basis points of rollover into 2024. And then just on polymer centers and the renewable natural gas, you can think of polymer centers kind of the $12 million or so incremental contribution next year from an EBITDA perspective. and things circa $15 million to $20 million on the RNG portfolio. That EBITDA.\nTyler Brown: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. So if the prints are right, then the economy grew 4.9% real GDP annualized for the third quarter, and it's really the consumer leading that. Can you talk about your view of the broader macro right now? And specifically, and I know you're not guiding for 2024, what kind of a volume environment we are in, on an underlying basis? Are we still in a positive volume growth environment from your view?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Listen, there's tons of uncertainty in the economy. You can look back 18 months. And then even if you look forward, do you think about 2 wars going on and lots of different dynamics, election coming up next year. The underlying -- but I think we're closer to a soft landing than we certainly were a quarter ago. if you look at the outlook, and we're planning on a positive year next year, and you heard that in our numbers and forecasts with a lot of humility baked into that in terms of things could change as uncertainty and we'll adjust according to that. . The recycling and solid waste business, the underlying volume growth in that business is kind of 50 to 100 bps. We're on the lower end of that with where construction is at. That's certainly been a soft spot. And we saw that with residential and commercial starts even last year and then earlier into this year is -- slowing down. And we're hoping that starts to anniversary and rebound. -- here. So I'd say positive environment. We're not firing on every cylinder, but we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to grow out of this thing coming into next year.\nNoah Kaye: Very helpful. Given the progress that you and the industry have made in reducing some of the volatility around recycling commodities and the impact of the business. Just Curious to know how to think about whether as it relates to the polymer center or any of the vertical integration efforts you have, what the level of exposure is to commodities in that business? . In other words, is this largely a processing and fee-based model for you? And is there any increased sensitivity to be expected from that?\nJon Vander Ark: No. The model is constructed. We're really making money on the spread and so that's one thing that we -- when we did this investment, we were very sensitive to that we're not adding to the volatility of the overall profile. So could there be spots on the margin, of course. But in general, this isn't something where we're increasing our exposure.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, because you have that underlying commodity risk, as you get the value of the upside tackling you capture that spread, you have the same amount of volatility in dollars with incremental revenue. So as a percentage of volatility actually goes down.\nNoah Kaye: Right, right. So it's really an infrastructure and spread play. Okay. That's really helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much. On the ES side, US Ecology used to have a decent exposure to the auto industry given its Michigan density. So how are we sort of weathering what's going on with the strikes and that business?\nJon Vander Ark: Reasonably well. There's been some slowdown in activity in certain spots. But as you can kind of read from the headlines, right? It's been walkouts on certain facilities to the point where if it was a mass shutdown, right, we'd have a much deeper impact because it would be all the automotive plants that we serve directly, but then it goes straight into the Tier 1, Tier 2 and even Tier 3 supply base. It's been such a case, I mean, we're a very, very small portion of the overall cost structure. So you're not seeing people going to get down to canceling service or even reducing service intervals outside of a few facilities that have been directly impacted.\nMichael Hoffman: And then, dwell on the RNG accounting since you're doing mostly partnerships. Is this going to be an add back into the EBITDA, or how are you going to account for this as we see printed financial statements?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. As we do the reconciliation, Michael, moving from net income to the definition of EBITDA, we will include our pickup in those joint ventures. Remember that, this first round of facilities that are coming online, most of those are going to be predominantly royalty, so you're not going to see a lot of that in 2024. That will start being 2025 and beyond, that you'll really start to see the accounting that includes the pickup in those JVs.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Great. That's what I needed. And just one last, you had a great margin expansion and yet you're reaffirming the guidance. It seems like you're then expecting a lot more seasonality in 4Q given the strength of the margins or we're at least at the very top end of the range. That's sort of where I - ?\nJon Vander Ark: I'd say, we have a positive outlook. Yeah, we're already in Q4, obviously, and we've got a positive outlook for that. But given that there is some seasonality of the business, where you do get some weather to start to impact the business this time of year, given there are some moving pieces in the broader economy, we thought it would be prudent to reaffirm and we'll give you the results here in February, how we finish.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: But to that point, Michael, if you remember, even when we began the year, said the cadence of margin expansion was going to actually start negative, which we saw in the first quarter. And sequentially, year-over-year margin expansion was going to improve every quarter throughout the year, and we still expect that. So we still expect to see the most amount of margin expansion in the fourth quarter, ultimately driving margin expansion for the full year.\nMichael Hoffman: But margins might be down sequentially just because of seasonality.\nJon Vander Ark: That is correct.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That's what I want to clarify. All right. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. So acquisitions were 1.7% in the third quarter. You said 50 basis points for 2024. It looks like maybe couple of hundred million rolled off third quarter to fourth quarter last year. So we're looking at, what, maybe 150 basis points in the fourth quarter this year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Remember, when we talked about most of the rollover that we had for full year 2023 was the portion of US Ecology that we completed May of 2022 right? Coming in, which was a majority of the rollover for the full year. As we think about the actual impact within the fourth quarter, we're looking about 180 basis points.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. All right. Thank you for that. And second, on the RNG development. I think around now is when these facilities were scheduled to come online and maybe you could just remind me the financial targets and how those 39 RNG facilities with the BP joint venture are expected to ramp from here?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So let me just talk about the entire portfolio rather than just the subset, right? So again, five have already come online here that are going to start contributing here nominally in the fourth quarter, but really start to contribute in 2024. You can kind of think about the cadence in the $20 million to $25 million per year of incremental EBITDA beginning in 2024 and ultimately hitting run rate $28 million at which point we expect $100 million cumulative of additional EBITDA in the portfolio compared to our current baseline. .\nDavid Manthey: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. I'm wondering if we could just talk about the margin opportunity over the course of 2024, Brian, as you pointed out, margin momentum on a seasonally adjusted basis is accelerating this year. So you're already on track to expand margins by, call it, a full 30, 40 basis points just on a run rate 3Q versus the full year average. And so as we think about the moving pieces in 2024, I guess it's not hard to get to double your normal margin expansion targets, especially given the moves in -- potential moves in OCC. And I'm wondering, anything that we need to keep in mind as we look at those moving pieces and the cadence of margins that you pointed out in an answer to an earlier question?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. So Jerry, the one thing I would point out is just remember from the point in time in which we acquired US Ecology and we took several pricing actions, right? And as we sit there and move forward, we're going to get more in the cadence of more of an annual price increase on that portion of the business. So while we still expect margin expansion in the Environmental Solutions business and at a rate north or higher than what we expect in recycling and waste. We would expect that margin expansion to decelerate from what you saw in 2023. So you can look in -- just in the quarter alone, margin was up almost 400 basis points year-over-year. We would not expect that level of contribution going forward.\nJerry Revich: Got it. But the base business, the momentum, it sounds like is accelerating, excluding ES.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, correct. I mean if you take a look just right now, we're kind of in the 30 basis points. We talked long term in that 30 to 50, and you start to get some of the contribution from some of the other sustainability investments that we're making. So it's a little bit of push and pull and net-net, we would expect margin expansion in 2024 over 2023.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Super. And can we talk about capital deployment with the buyback announcement. Can you just update us on how much more runway do you think you have to deploy more capital towards polymers, opportunities to redevelop gas electric plants into gas plants and stock buyback from there? Can you just calibrate us on how to think about the opportunities in each of those areas?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Sure. Just to give you an idea, if we've talked about, right, several investments, you've got the RNG portfolio, you've got polymer center and you have Blue Polymers, some of which is going to come through capital, some of which is going to be the investment in the JVs just to kind of think it from a cumulative perspective here, maybe I'll walk through each from polymer centers, we see a total investment of around $300 million, okay, for the four centers. right? And that's going to happen, right? It's happened, and we think that's over a four-year time frame of about $70 million a year. Blue Polymers, you can think of that being about $160 million investment. And again, those are going to be JVs. So that will come through as an investment in those joint ventures. And then the investment in the RNG portfolio is all around $375 million, okay? So those are the cumulative investments, but we've been making those investments. So those are somewhat in our run rate. Now -- and we talked about that after the US Ecology acquisition, where leverage elevates to 3.4 times, we were going to focus on deleveraging, getting back to that three times before we resume the share repurchase, got back to 2.9 times. We have since resumed, right, that share repurchase program. And as you just saw in the announcement, right, the Board just authorized another $3 billion program that extends over the next three years beginning in 2024 through the end of 2026.\nJerry Revich : Super. Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Good afternoon.\nStephanie Moore: Hey, guys. I appreciate the color so far in kind of 2024 outlook and just now on kind of the margin opportunity, too. But, maybe could you talk a little bit about your views on inflation in 2024? Not necessarily hard numbers, but kind of buckets of areas where you think some inflationary pressures maybe could linger from 2023, or -- on the other side of that, should abate versus 2023. Just trying to think of those puts and takes would be helpful. Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I think for most categories, kind of thinking about macro metric like CPPI kind of puts you in the right zone. Maintenance will be elevated off of that, just historically, it's inflated a little faster than that. And we don't expect the supply chain to be fully caught up or reconcile in 2024, which means we're going to be driving some older equipment, and that's going to be at the end of the curve where maintenance cost is higher than it normally would be. So that would be the one, I think, is going to be elevated. Everything else kind of think about that, where you see inflation going? And if that's 4%, 4.5%, whatever that plans, that's kind of where we'll build a budget against that.\nStephanie Moore: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the commodity basket exposure. Can you talk a little bit about how that basket is trending today? Maybe how that compares to 4Q of last year? I know there's some puts and takes to the various components. So that would be helpful. Thanks. \nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, sure. So as we said, our average commodity price for the third quarter was $112 per ton. Right now, we're expecting about $10 in the fourth quarter. That compared in the prior year for the fourth quarter, we were at $88 per ton. So we're expecting a year-over-year increase of about $30 a ton in the fourth quarter.\nStephanie Moore: Guy, I'll leave it at that. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist. Please go ahead.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. To kind of follow-up on a recent question, but ask it from a different angle. If you think about some of the pressures on margins smaller players that might be potential acquisition targets. How do you anticipate trends in a few buckets impacting their financial performance and maybe desire to sell? And I kind of -- I'm thinking of inflation in terms of their costs, the ongoing requirement and necessity to invest in technology. And then as you just mentioned, I think fleet and supply chain won't fully be normalized. But if you apply those things to sort of the other side of the equation, not your own business, but those that you may look to incorporate in your business, what do you see?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. The pipeline for acquisitions is strong, both in recycling and Waste and Environmental Solutions. This is the cost pressure, which is started to abate for the smaller players is on the labor side. So they're starting to get less pressure there as we've seen turnover come down and labor availability go up. It's still elevated versus historical norm, but it's gotten easier relative to a year ago. The supply chain hasn't and that's certainly becoming constrained. And anybody who was a spot buyer of vehicles is really in a challenged spot certainly through the end of next year and probably in 2025 or 2026, depending on how they -- how fast the supply chain can recover because they're prioritizing all of their base customers who buy a large number and a similar number of trucks every year. So we certainly see that as an advantage. And then digital, I'd say, has just been a building trend over the last five-plus years that I think is going to be with us for at least the next five and probably a much longer period than that, which is that we're making over a series of years, between capital and OpEx hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to our digital footprint to make the experience better for our customers and employees, and that certainly has a scale advantage for us. and also a skill advantage of investing in the resources we want to take those technologies and apply them in a way that make our customers' lives and employees lives better.\nTobey Sommer: And then just as my follow-up. I know it's been in the news, maybe even too much ad nauseam. But GLP-1s in the market, looking for second, third, fourth, all the way to nth derivative impacts. Have you looked at that in have any sort of preliminary view on what that could mean for volumes over what would probably be a very long-term? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: No. We've not done a lot of work on that yet, plenty in front of us right now, obviously, is that continues to be a major trend. We'll think about that. But I'd say we're in the tertiary or beyond in terms of the impact of those.\nTobey Sommer: I appreciate the response. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Just in regards to the M&A pipeline within Environmental Services, I think up here in Canada, there's been the Competition Bureau is trying to prevent the merger to I guess, I'll call them energy waste service companies here. So it looks like there'll be some assets. Just wondering how the pipeline looks up here in Canada. And -- and is energy waste services in an area of growth for you or accelerated growth for you when you look at your opportunities in Canada?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're certainly looking at opportunities in both U.S. and Canada. That probably isn't at the top of the list. We'd be more opportunistic in that side of environmental services.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. And just I get the pricing, I guess, it sounds like the pricing opportunities that you're going to move from something that you're doing it three, four times a year within environmental services to once a year, which is maybe more regular as inflation starts to or continues to subside here. But just given the pricing opportunities that you've talked about and the ability to get pricing more aligned with how you think about pricing within solid waste, just why not push that lever more if you can, or did you feel the customers were starting to push back on maybe the frequency in which you are coming to them with price increases within ES?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah. No. I mean, yes, it's a big and diverse space. So there's been places where we've pushed past the price line we would have wanted to. We've lost some volume, which I congratulate the team, obviously. You don't understand the sealing on price until you take it there. And listen, in certain parts of the business, we'll get into more of an annual increase for our bigger customers that's contracted, for example. In other parts of the business, particularly the more field facing field services, those are things where it's really dynamic pricing, because every opportunity event job, you've got a lot more flexibility there. And we'll certainly test the market and see what the market bears in terms of opportunity. I'd say underneath that, too, there's a big mix opportunity, which is just looking at the types of jobs we do, looking at the customer mix and making sure we're prioritizing our sales team around the most attractive customers and then conversely deprioritizing around customers who aren't willing to pay what we think is a very fair value for what we deliver.\nKevin Chiang: That makes a ton of sense. Thanks for taking my question, and best of luck as you get through this year.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Betsy. I would like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their continued commitment to providing our customers with first-class service to create a more sustainable world. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks Aaron. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Our strong third quarter results reflect our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while generating healthy margin expansion across our business. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 6%, including 2% from acquisitions, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% and expanded EBITDA margin by 70 basis points, report adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 and produced $1.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we have invested $947 million in acquisitions. All transactions were in the recycling and waste space. The M&A environment remains active with opportunities in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We remain confident that we will exceed $1 billion of investment for the year. Year-to-date, we returned $671 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes $201 million of share repurchases completed during the third quarter as our leverage ratio returned to target levels. We continue to make progress, demonstrating the value of our complete set of products and offerings to customers while increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in the Environmental Solutions business remains strong, and we continue to drive organic growth through cross-selling. EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved sequentially to 22.7% in the third quarter and expanded 390 basis points over the prior year. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy in support of our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal, our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by our valuable service offerings and quality service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter, with simultaneous increases in both price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.2%, and organic volume growth and related revenue was 10 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route optimization, further improved safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. For example, we now have the ability to provide real-time customer notifications regarding expected service time on a given day. We are in the early stages of deploying advanced contamination over time and drive incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in areas such as plastic circularity and renewable natural gas or a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers remains on track. Construction of our Las Vegas Polymer Center is substantially complete, and we expect full scale operations to begin in November. Our Midwest Polymer center will be located in India. This center will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility with operations expected to begin in late 2024. The renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners are continuing to advance. I projects were online by the end of the third quarter, and we expect eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We are making progress in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We expect to have 12 electric vehicles in operation by year-end and more than 60 EVs to be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We now have 6 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development. We continue to be recognized as an employer of choice and are proud to be certified as a great place to work for the seventh consecutive year. Our team members remain highly engaged to ensure that we are delivering high-quality essential services that are valued by our customers. I now turn the call over to Brian, who'll provide more details for the quarter. Yeah, let me do one more section, please. We are proud of the results we delivered during the third quarter. Healthy contribution from our pricing strategy more than offset recycled commodity headwinds and cost inflation, which continues to moderate. Looking forward to 2024, we expect continued outsized growth in the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses, supported by pricing ahead of underlying costs, cross-selling our complete set of products and services and capitalizing on value-creating acquisition opportunities. We also expect financial contribution from the investments made in sustainability innovation, including plastic circularity and renewable natural gas projects. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow along with margin expansion. We plan to provide detailed guidance on our earnings call in February. Now with that, operator, I would like to turn it over for questions. Yeah. We're not providing guidance today, obviously, on 2024, but we expect \u2013 the outlook is positive. So I think about high to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, and we'll grow free cash flow and EBITDA margin faster than that, and that gets to your pricing question, we just -- pricing will come down nominally as inflation comes down, but we'll still be pricing ahead of our cost inflation, which should lead to that formula where we're going to grow the bottom line a little faster than the top line. We're certainly \u2013 we talked about cost inflation modulating in the second half, and we're certainly seeing that. So you can see that in some of the cost categories, labor, maintenance, certainly a bright spot. The supply chain there, maybe getting incrementally better, but still, we're not going to get all the trucks we want this year. But I think if you see the improvement in the maintenance, that really speaks to the underlying cost of parts inflation has certainly improved versus the first half. And we expect those costs to continue to modulate into next year as well. Yes, it really comes down to timing. The pipeline is strong, lots of opportunities, lots of conversations. And we remain incredibly disciplined in terms of our financial strategic lens and our financial lens on that, but we feel certainly optimistic through the remainder of the year and into the first half of next year that there's a number of attractive opportunities in that space. Hey, Tyler. I think we're near it, quite honestly, Tyler here. Again, we talked about the relationship between CPI-based pricing starting to step down, but water sewer trash and garbage trash stepping up. And right now, I think they're somewhat offsetting each other. We think that to the question earlier about as you look forward, we do think that the restricted base pricing does step down sequentially 2024 from 2023, but again, it still stays above that longer-term average. Yes. No, pricing remains strong. We certainly remain committed on that. There's sort of that's a customer churn on that portfolio. Some of that's permanent work, some of that is event work, and we're trading off some low-margin work, and we're adding to that very attractive cross-sell work. And so lots of really attractive growth opportunities in that space, but we're never going to do work for free, and we're always going to start out with price on that. So in the macro environment in manufacturing and ES broadly is a bit mixed. So the upstream oil and gas has been slower. Hopefully, a couple of big deals announced here that, that will ignite some increased activity there in Q4 and into next year. Automotive, obviously, has been a little bit challenged here with the labor activity. But then other parts of the petrochemical complex have been very, very strong. And overall, we're happy with the results and still feel very positive going into 2024 in terms of the demand environment. Yes. Listen, there's tons of uncertainty in the economy. You can look back 18 months. And then even if you look forward, do you think about 2 wars going on and lots of different dynamics, election coming up next year. The underlying -- but I think we're closer to a soft landing than we certainly were a quarter ago. if you look at the outlook, and we're planning on a positive year next year, and you heard that in our numbers and forecasts with a lot of humility baked into that in terms of things could change as uncertainty and we'll adjust according to that. . The recycling and solid waste business, the underlying volume growth in that business is kind of 50 to 100 bps. We're on the lower end of that with where construction is at. That's certainly been a soft spot. And we saw that with residential and commercial starts even last year and then earlier into this year is -- slowing down. And we're hoping that starts to anniversary and rebound. -- here. So I'd say positive environment. We're not firing on every cylinder, but we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to grow out of this thing coming into next year. No. The model is constructed. We're really making money on the spread and so that's one thing that we -- when we did this investment, we were very sensitive to that we're not adding to the volatility of the overall profile. So could there be spots on the margin, of course. But in general, this isn't something where we're increasing our exposure. Reasonably well. There's been some slowdown in activity in certain spots. But as you can kind of read from the headlines, right? It's been walkouts on certain facilities to the point where if it was a mass shutdown, right, we'd have a much deeper impact because it would be all the automotive plants that we serve directly, but then it goes straight into the Tier 1, Tier 2 and even Tier 3 supply base. It's been such a case, I mean, we're a very, very small portion of the overall cost structure. So you're not seeing people going to get down to canceling service or even reducing service intervals outside of a few facilities that have been directly impacted. I'd say, we have a positive outlook. Yeah, we're already in Q4, obviously, and we've got a positive outlook for that. But given that there is some seasonality of the business, where you do get some weather to start to impact the business this time of year, given there are some moving pieces in the broader economy, we thought it would be prudent to reaffirm and we'll give you the results here in February, how we finish. That is correct. Good afternoon. Yes. I think for most categories, kind of thinking about macro metric like CPPI kind of puts you in the right zone. Maintenance will be elevated off of that, just historically, it's inflated a little faster than that. And we don't expect the supply chain to be fully caught up or reconcile in 2024, which means we're going to be driving some older equipment, and that's going to be at the end of the curve where maintenance cost is higher than it normally would be. So that would be the one, I think, is going to be elevated. Everything else kind of think about that, where you see inflation going? And if that's 4%, 4.5%, whatever that plans, that's kind of where we'll build a budget against that. Yes. The pipeline for acquisitions is strong, both in recycling and Waste and Environmental Solutions. This is the cost pressure, which is started to abate for the smaller players is on the labor side. So they're starting to get less pressure there as we've seen turnover come down and labor availability go up. It's still elevated versus historical norm, but it's gotten easier relative to a year ago. The supply chain hasn't and that's certainly becoming constrained. And anybody who was a spot buyer of vehicles is really in a challenged spot certainly through the end of next year and probably in 2025 or 2026, depending on how they -- how fast the supply chain can recover because they're prioritizing all of their base customers who buy a large number and a similar number of trucks every year. So we certainly see that as an advantage. And then digital, I'd say, has just been a building trend over the last five-plus years that I think is going to be with us for at least the next five and probably a much longer period than that, which is that we're making over a series of years, between capital and OpEx hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to our digital footprint to make the experience better for our customers and employees, and that certainly has a scale advantage for us. and also a skill advantage of investing in the resources we want to take those technologies and apply them in a way that make our customers' lives and employees lives better. No. We've not done a lot of work on that yet, plenty in front of us right now, obviously, is that continues to be a major trend. We'll think about that. But I'd say we're in the tertiary or beyond in terms of the impact of those. Yes. We're certainly looking at opportunities in both U.S. and Canada. That probably isn't at the top of the list. We'd be more opportunistic in that side of environmental services. Yeah. No. I mean, yes, it's a big and diverse space.

Thank you, Betsy. I would like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their continued commitment to providing our customers with first-class service to create a more sustainable world. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "name": "Brian DelGhiaccio",
            "content": "Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%. Core price on related revenue was 8.6% and which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12% and large container of 8.6% and residential of 8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.2%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue and related revenue increased 10 basis points. The component of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 50 basis points and an increase in landfill of 3.5%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.2% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.7% and a decrease in landfill C&D volumes of 6.2%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $112 per ton during the quarter. This compares to $162 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 20 basis points during the quarter. We continue to see a steady recovery in fiber markets and plastics pricing has improved from recent lows. Our current average commodity price is approximately $120 per ton. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $8 million over the prior year. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.7% and an increase of 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 29.9%. Margin performance during the quarter included margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points and a 30 basis point increase from one less workday. This was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions, a 20 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point decrease from net fuel. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year capital expenditures and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date net capital expenditures of $935 million represents 56% of our projected full year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $152 million represents approximately 60% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $12 billion, and total liquidity was $2.3 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 21.4% during the third quarter. The relatively lower tax rate included a $20 million favorable tax settlement from previous tax years, which added $0.06 of EPS during the quarter. We now expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 24.5% for the full year. As noted in our earnings press release, we upwardly revised our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.49 primarily as a result of the lower tax rate. We remain comfortable achieving the other components of full year financial guidance that we provided in July. I will now turn the call back to Jon. Actually, we're going to open it up for Q&A. Yes. Look, as you mentioned, we raised the full year EPS guidance predominantly due to the relatively lower tax rate. There is a cash component to that as well. That is somewhat offset by relatively higher interest rates than we normally thought, which is flowing through to cash interest, and that's why your adjusted free cash flow remains relatively consistent with what we previously provided. Yes. So first on the rollover, based on transactions that have closed to date, that'd be about 50 basis points of rollover into 2024. And then just on polymer centers and the renewable natural gas, you can think of polymer centers kind of the $12 million or so incremental contribution next year from an EBITDA perspective. and things circa $15 million to $20 million on the RNG portfolio. That EBITDA. Yes, because you have that underlying commodity risk, as you get the value of the upside tackling you capture that spread, you have the same amount of volatility in dollars with incremental revenue. So as a percentage of volatility actually goes down. Yeah. As we do the reconciliation, Michael, moving from net income to the definition of EBITDA, we will include our pickup in those joint ventures. Remember that, this first round of facilities that are coming online, most of those are going to be predominantly royalty, so you're not going to see a lot of that in 2024. That will start being 2025 and beyond, that you'll really start to see the accounting that includes the pickup in those JVs. But to that point, Michael, if you remember, even when we began the year, said the cadence of margin expansion was going to actually start negative, which we saw in the first quarter. And sequentially, year-over-year margin expansion was going to improve every quarter throughout the year, and we still expect that. So we still expect to see the most amount of margin expansion in the fourth quarter, ultimately driving margin expansion for the full year. Yeah. Remember, when we talked about most of the rollover that we had for full year 2023 was the portion of US Ecology that we completed May of 2022 right? Coming in, which was a majority of the rollover for the full year. As we think about the actual impact within the fourth quarter, we're looking about 180 basis points. Yes. So let me just talk about the entire portfolio rather than just the subset, right? So again, five have already come online here that are going to start contributing here nominally in the fourth quarter, but really start to contribute in 2024. You can kind of think about the cadence in the $20 million to $25 million per year of incremental EBITDA beginning in 2024 and ultimately hitting run rate $28 million at which point we expect $100 million cumulative of additional EBITDA in the portfolio compared to our current baseline. . Yeah. So Jerry, the one thing I would point out is just remember from the point in time in which we acquired US Ecology and we took several pricing actions, right? And as we sit there and move forward, we're going to get more in the cadence of more of an annual price increase on that portion of the business. So while we still expect margin expansion in the Environmental Solutions business and at a rate north or higher than what we expect in recycling and waste. We would expect that margin expansion to decelerate from what you saw in 2023. So you can look in -- just in the quarter alone, margin was up almost 400 basis points year-over-year. We would not expect that level of contribution going forward. Yeah, correct. I mean if you take a look just right now, we're kind of in the 30 basis points. We talked long term in that 30 to 50, and you start to get some of the contribution from some of the other sustainability investments that we're making. So it's a little bit of push and pull and net-net, we would expect margin expansion in 2024 over 2023. Sure. Just to give you an idea, if we've talked about, right, several investments, you've got the RNG portfolio, you've got polymer center and you have Blue Polymers, some of which is going to come through capital, some of which is going to be the investment in the JVs just to kind of think it from a cumulative perspective here, maybe I'll walk through each from polymer centers, we see a total investment of around $300 million, okay, for the four centers. right? And that's going to happen, right? It's happened, and we think that's over a four-year time frame of about $70 million a year. Blue Polymers, you can think of that being about $160 million investment. And again, those are going to be JVs. So that will come through as an investment in those joint ventures. And then the investment in the RNG portfolio is all around $375 million, okay? So those are the cumulative investments, but we've been making those investments. So those are somewhat in our run rate. Now -- and we talked about that after the US Ecology acquisition, where leverage elevates to 3.4 times, we were going to focus on deleveraging, getting back to that three times before we resume the share repurchase, got back to 2.9 times. We have since resumed, right, that share repurchase program. And as you just saw in the announcement, right, the Board just authorized another $3 billion program that extends over the next three years beginning in 2024 through the end of 2026. You bet. Yes, sure. So as we said, our average commodity price for the third quarter was $112 per ton. Right now, we're expecting about $10 in the fourth quarter. That compared in the prior year for the fourth quarter, we were at $88 per ton. So we're expecting a year-over-year increase of about $30 a ton in the fourth quarter."

Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and the execution of our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business both organically and through acquisitions while enhancing profitability. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 9%, including more than 4% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.5%; expanded EBITDA margin by 40 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41; and produced $1.26 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 10% increase over the prior year. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we invested $927 million of acquisitions, all transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space, including the acquisition of assets in Colorado and New Mexico from GFL. The M&A environment remains active with opportunities in both the recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We now expect investment in value creating acquisitions to exceed $1 billion for the year. We are making great progress on the integration of U.S. Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in this business remains strong. Customers value our complete set of products and services. We have achieved over $110 million in new sales to date as a result of cross-selling our products and services. The sales pipeline is robust with opportunities for organic growth and expansion of services within our existing customer base. We achieved more than $40 million of annualized cost synergies and EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved to more than 22% in the quarter. The strong results we achieved in the first half of the year, along with the positive momentum in our business, supports a full-year financial outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in a range of $14.775 billion to $14.85 billion, adjusted EBITDA in a range of $4.34 billion to $4.36 billion, adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.33 to $5.38 and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion. Our updated financial guidance includes the contribution from acquisitions closed through June 30th. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding Customer Zeal. Our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained over 94% and we continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter and simultaneously increases in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. This includes landfill MSW yield of 6.2%. This is the highest level performance in company history in this category. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 50 basis points. Turning to Digital. We have reached a milestone in our efforts to create digital tools to enhance our customers and employees' experience and deliver meaningful financial benefits. The deployment of RISE tablets in our Recycling and Solid Waste Collection business was completed during the second quarter. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route adherence, improve safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery for our customers. In total, we believe the benefits of our digital initiatives are worth approximately $100 million, with $50 million already achieved and $50 million to be captured over the next three years. Moving on to Sustainability. We continue to invest in differentiating capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. Earlier today, we announced a joint venture with Ravago called Blue Polymers. This groundbreaking partnership further supports our efforts to lead in a plastic circularity. Blue Polymers will utilize recycled olefins from our Polymer Centers to create blended pellets for use in manufacturing sustainable packaging. We expect to open four facilities beginning in late 2024 with earning contribution beginning in 2026. Development of our Polymer Centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on track, with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024, respectively. Demand for recycled plastics remains strong as the consumer goods industry continues to work toward achieving their sustainability goals. For example, we are partnering with a Coca-Cola Company to supply recycled PET from our Polymer Centers for use in sustainable packaging. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect four of these projects to be operational by the end of the third quarter. Finally, we continue to believe that creating a more sustainable world is our responsibility and a platform for growth. We recently published our latest sustainability report, highlighting the progress we are making on our 2030 goals. These goals are supported by investments we are making in Polymer Centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects and fleet electrification. I'll now turn the call over to Brian who will provide details for the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.3%. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 11% and restricted pricing of 5.3%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.8% and residential of 8.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 40 basis points, while volume on related revenue increased 50 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.4%, an increase in residential of 80 basis points, and an increase in landfill of 3.7%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.3%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. Moving on to Recycling. Commodity prices were $119 per ton during the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 1.1% during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe commodity prices will remain relatively flat with current levels in the second half of the year and we now expect average recycled commodity prices in a range of $110 to $115 per ton for the full-year. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $104 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of U.S. Ecology. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.5%, a sequential increase of more than 150 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 30% during the quarter. Margin performance included a 50 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which was fully overcome by a 100 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 20 basis points. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.26 billion. Our performance through the first half benefited from the timing of capital expenditures and cash taxes. Year-to-date, capital expenditures of $550 million represents 33% of our projected full-year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $99 million, represents 40% of our projected full-year spend. Total debt was $12.2 billion and total liquidity was $2.1 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter returned to approximately 3x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.8% during the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 25% in the second half of the year, resulting in a full-year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bryan Burgmeier of Citi. Please go ahead.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. On the Blue Polymer announcement this morning, is that something that's already captured in the pro forma earnings from Polymer Centers that you've spoken about previously? Or is this going to be incremental? And if it is incremental, could you give the full sense of the potential impact?\nJon Vander Ark: No, it's incremental. So think about that Polymer Center producing two things, PET on one side and olefins on the other side. At the PET, we take into a flake, basically, a hot wash clean flake that's food grade that can go right back into water bottle manufacturing or other types of PET applications. On the olefins, it takes a slightly different path. So we sort, get full collection of that olefins and then we feed the Polymer Center. So this basically guarantees the demand on the back end of our Polymer Center for the olefin side of it. And then Ravago was world-class at compounding and blending olefins to create unique products. And so that's why we partnered with them. We think we can provide the right applications to the market. We get to participate \u2013 not only do we get the supply, so it affects the supply agreement on one side, we get to participate in the benefit and the upside as a 45% minority JV partner.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. From an economics perspective, we look at our equity pickup, that one line pickup, beginning in 2026 two centers somewhat contributing in that year with about $15 million. So you can think $7 million to $8 million per center. And then getting $7 million to $8 million incremental in both 2027 and 2028. Ultimately, we see $30 million to $32 million worth of EBITDA for all four at run rate in 2029.\nBryan Burgmeier: Understood. Thanks for that detail. And if I can just maybe follow-up on the recycling business. I think your filings say your volume is about 80% fiber. Once the Polymer Centers are online, do you think that 80% fiber exposure drops a bit? Or is there maybe a different way we should start to think about value versus volume? Thanks, and I will turn it over.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Look, initially, it won't drop much, at least from a volume standpoint, because what we're really doing with Polymer Center is taking things that are down cycle today and some material along the way in that down cycling is lost and landfilled to get full volume recovery out of that plastic and get much higher yield because they're driving true circularity. Now these Polymer Centers are built actually to take third-party product over time. So over time, we'll flow third-party product in there. That will put more plastic into the system and then dilute the fiber percentage right at a certain level, but you're probably talking more like going from 80 to 75 versus a major change in the mix.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. You mentioned a couple of comments on volume, and I was just wondering if volume was sort of in line with what you were expecting or if it was a little bit lighter. And I know you mentioned the construction activity and the special waste was something mentioned by one of your competitors is slowing. I know here, you got the 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. But just anything on volume trends and where things are above or below what you were expecting and how you think for the rest of the year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I'd say broadly kind of in line with expectation, probably slightly ahead in certain areas. So construction, we anticipated that being down. We saw residential and commercial starts obviously start to soften the second half of last year. And there's a lag effect as we have jobs that are getting completed. And so we're down 3.8%, but we have really strong pricing there. So we've taken the opportunity there to be disciplined on price and making sure that we're getting a positive mix even in that environment. And then other special waste, right, is attractive. Part of that special waste clearly is our cross-sell initiatives. With the U.S. Ecology acquisition, we have now a unique offering in the marketplace, and we're seeing customers demand to that unique offering. So that's certainly helping us. Small container was a bright spot, right, in terms of volume growth for the quarter. So I feel really good about that as well. And again, I'd say broadly in line with what we expected.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And Toni, if you remember, in our original guidance, the range on volume was 50 basis points to 1% positive. And now we're thinking it's at that \u2013 still within the range, but at the lower end. But at the same time, we increased our guidance on average yields, right? So the flow-through and the contribution of a 50 basis point increase on yield is much more significant to the enterprise in our results than the 50 basis point decrease on the volume side.\nToni Kaplan: Yes, understood. And then you mentioned the partnership with Coca-Cola. Can you talk about potential impacts from that? It might be a little bit longer term, but just any thoughts on how to quantify how you're thinking about that partnership and the benefits to you? Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, Coca-Cola has been a great partner. I would say this, demand for our product out of the Polymer Center outstrip supply by a lot, right? So we were able to talk to a number of parties. We could have sold the Las Vegas center out three or four times over without challenges because the market is so short supplied for this type of ARPA that's food grade. And we're taking it right now, the single site over time, we'll take the Midwest side. And then these partnerships will evolve, and I'm certain they'll grow, right, as we expand the network, but that's all we're disclosing at this point.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Brian, just real quick from a modeling perspective, what is the expected contribution from M&A in the new revenue guidance? I think it was supposed to be maybe a 3% contributor coming into the year. Is it maybe closer to 3.5% to 4%? And then how much rolls into 2024 based on what we know today?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So the in-year contribution rollover from 2022 transactions as well as the in-year impact from 2023 transactions, we're thinking 4.25%, right? And the rollover impact into 2024, right, from the deals that were completed in 2023, we think adds 50 basis points to our 2024 revenue growth.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then \u2013 so I just kind of want to think about the EBITDA a little bit. So it looks like you raised EBITDA by, call it, $50 million. But if I'm not mistaken, you actually lowered your commodity assumption, but then you added in some M&A. So basically, I'm trying to bridge that change. How much of the EBITDA change was basically core versus some other moving pieces, if that makes sense at all.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Let me answer the question. The short story is that the entire increase is essentially the underlying business. So let me go through some of the puts and takes. So to your point, right, we've added EBITDA associated with acquisitions, but most of those acquisitions were completed mid-year. So you're going to have half the contribution. We've also got deal and integration costs. Two of these deals require regulatory filings, so we had heavy legal costs. We also have a fairly significant integration costs just because one of those deals requires that we rebrand the trucks within the first six months. So the contributions from acquisitions in here is still positive, but it's somewhat muted. To your point, that's been further offset by the reduction in recycled commodity prices. So if you think about taking all those things I just mentioned relative to our original guide, it's a relative push. The $50 million increase in EBITDA at the midpoint is essentially the increase in price flowing through to the bottom line.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. Yes, okay, that's what I thought. Okay, just real quick on the last one here. So if we just exclude Blue Polymer and we just look at the Vegas facility, what is the expected EBITDA impact of that facility in 2024? And then how dependent will it be on recycled plastic prices because we have seen some weakness there recently. And basically, sorry, does this Blue Polymer JV, does it kind of inoculate that offtake risk longer term? Am I thinking about all that right?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Let me go ahead and start. You had a couple of questions there, so we'll kind of unpack some of those. So the expected contribution from just the Polymer Center, right, so this is the one in Vegas in 2024 is $15 million, right, of EBITDA contribution in 2024. You can then think of about an incremental $20 million per year thereafter, right, as we bring other centers online, ultimately getting to about $80 million worth of EBITDA at run rate in 2028. To your other point, right, on the Blue Polymers, yes, we are going to be selling all of the olefins coming out of the Polymer Center 2, the Blue Polymers JV, right? And when you start thinking about the offtake agreement there that guarantees, right, a contractual rate for all of those units leaving Blue Polymers on the olefin side \u2013 or I'm sorry, Polymer Center on the olefin side.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. Yes, so it kind of helps inoculate the offtake longer-term.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes.\nTyler Brown: If I read it right.\nJon Vander Ark: Correct.\nTyler Brown: Okay. All right. Thank you guys so much. Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Jon, I'm wondering if you could just expand on comments you recently made to the Wall Street Journal. You spoke about having visibility on double-digit topline growth here in the medium term. I'm wondering if you could just unpack what gives visibility on that between Polymer, M&A yield, other moving pieces? And in that type of topline environment, do you think you can still deliver the 2x leverage between revenue and earnings that Republic has done over the past decade? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're certainly starting with price, right? That's always the first component, right? We have to price ahead of our costs. You've seen the organic growth picture. And the underlying solid waste and recycling business is a slow growth business, right? And we expect to grow slightly faster than the market, only slightly because it's a highly contracted market and shares don't move easily. And again, we're always going to stay disciplined on price first. As we've expanded into Environmental Solutions, the underlying growth from an organic standpoint is certainly a little stronger. So that's a tailwind. On the growth side, we're doing more M&A than we ever had. It was six or seven years ago, we talked about spending $100 million a year in M&A. And then that's been ramped up to $500 million to $700 million, and obviously, we had announced last year the U.S. Ecology acquisition and got to $3 billion. But even outside of U.S. Ecology, it's $800 million of deals outside of U.S. Ecology. And this year, we've said more than $1 billion, and we're already sniffing up against that number. So M&A is certainly contributing. And then our other sustainability investments, right, are nice contributors and probably a little less on the topline in terms of really moving the needle given the scale of the business. But on the bottom line, right, these are kind of high EBITDA margin investment opportunity, very high return. So we feel great about that over time.\nJerry Revich: Super. And Brian, can I ask separately? In the quarter, really strong margin performance. Your COGS per unit were up just 3%. In terms of lumpy items that contributed to the results in the quarter? Or were the results pretty clean? It sounds like attrition was pretty low, but I'm wondering, were there any other moving pieces that helped margins or costs in the quarter that we should keep in mind before run rating the really strong results?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Look, I would say there's always some puts and takes. But I would say if you aggregate those from a net number perspective, it was a fairly clean quarter.\nJerry Revich: Well done. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Brian, could we walk through a dollar reconciliation of last year's EBITDA to this year's EBITDA on a dollar basis, so not just that aggregate change, the 50, but what are all the puts and takes? Because I think have the sense that we're understating the power of solid waste by just saying 50. This is on the guide. Sorry, I meant the guide.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, the guide. So, Michael, as I mentioned, I mean, we're not going to get into the individual components of the EBITDA contribution of our acquisitions and other things. But what I can tell you is, as I just said with Tyler on the phone, if you take a look at the in-year acquisition contribution net of those deal and integration costs, right, that is a positive number, which is almost entirely offset by the reduction in recycled commodities. That reduction in recycled commodities is about $15 million to $20 million negative compared to our original expectations. So if you look at guide to guide right at the midpoint, our EBITDA is up $50 million, which is the underlying business made up primarily of relatively higher price. We took our yield from 5.5% on total revenue to 6%. We took it from 6.5% on related to 7%. So that's that 50 basis points as well as just outperformance within the Environmental Solutions business. That's what's contributing, right, to the overall increase in EBITDA.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Could we then talk about Environmental Solutions, and would you talk about the price volume mix there because I think it's important for everybody to see that there's a combination of both in the pricing of a scarce asset continues.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, let me start there, Michael. We're working through that. Obviously, it's a little bit like special waste in terms of there's a mix issue that there's a lot of unique products and services. So we haven't nailed yet what we might report externally in terms of price or yield metric there, certainly our aspiration over time, whether that's large parts of the business, like yield per drum or things like that, work through it. But a huge portion of the outperformance there is price. We've taken multiple double-digit price increases, and we will lead from a pricing standpoint. And that's caused a few units to be shed in certain places. So we found the ceiling, but we're unafraid. These are valuable assets, impossible to replicate and customers are valuing what we're offering. So we're going to continue to push on that front. And that, also combined with the cross-sell, which is where we're driving a lot of the volume, has been a really good story and picture for that business.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. I mean just to put some numbers on that, Michael. If you take a look at the Environmental Solutions business, this time last year, was 17.1% EBITDA margin. This quarter, 22.5%. So that 540 basis points of margin improvement is essentially most of that being price-driven, but also just better overall utilization as well. We're becoming more efficient, and we're optimizing from a labor perspective. So when we do get those units, not just because of the price alone, but as far as the overall profitability of each one of those jobs, we're just becoming overall more efficient as we have better utilization of the assets and the resources that are providing those services.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. If I could just tease out one thing. We've had negative trends in ISM PMI were below 50 on the index. It looks like it's floor bottoming. But is there a positive volume even if I don't get the split, there's positive volume plus a lot of price?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I think, yes. And so we look at all those indices, too, Michael. And I think what we're not fully accounting for is a lot of the infrastructure spend and the government spending is flowing through. And we're certainly getting a lot of opportunity there.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And I think the other thing, too, Michael, that we're also seeing right now as well is the benefit of the cross-sell. As we said, we've now increased \u2013 or reported more than $110 million in new sales, which is positively impacting both the Environmental Solutions business as well as the Recycling and Solid Waste business. But more of that positively impacting the Environmental Solutions business just because when you take a look at the revenue per customer tends to just be higher than we see in recycling and solid waste.\nMichael Hoffman: All right. Let me squeeze one more, if I can. You raised price in 4Q, you raised it in 1Q. Did you raise it in 2Q as well?\nJon Vander Ark: We are actually in the process of raising prices here early in 3Q.\nMichael Hoffman: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Just on the volume, good job on growing that volume amid some of your peers seeing it contract a little bit. But I'm just curious as to whether we're hearing a little bit on the price competition from smaller players that are somewhat less disciplined in that regard and some of your peers walk away from that is. Are you seeing any evidence that smaller players are acting a little bit more aggressive here? And do you suspect that this will ultimately translate in either pressure on pricing or on volumes for your business going forward?\nJon Vander Ark: No, we haven't seen it. Now again, there's always an ankle biter and a market here or there who's going to take advantage of try to grow volume and figure out pretty quickly, right? That's a tough way to make a business and earn your cost of capital. With a small container, right, 9.5% yield, 1.4% volume. Really, really strong numbers for us this quarter. And that's a place we often see the price competition come in. That's where they try to attack because that's a profitable part of the business and people try to build their business there. They might start out on resi script or start out and temporal off and then they quickly get into that because that's the higher margin stuff. And so we've not seen the market broadly turn into a negative direction at all.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And the other thing, too, you have to remember is that there are still supply chain constraints on getting new trucks. So in order to sit there into, again, have that type of behavior, you'd have to have capacity in your system or be able to secure a new truck in order to service those new accounts. And we are not seeing those supply chain constraints easing anytime soon.\nWalter Spracklin: Right. Being a little bit of a natural limiter there. On the CapEx spend, we saw a few of your competitors, again, increase CapEx a little bit unexpectedly in certain cases. And just curious how you review your CapEx spend is \u2013 and new projects as they develop? Are you \u2013 have you looked at your budget for this year? Is that something you do on an ongoing basis? Is it upcoming? Are you seeing evidence of projects that perhaps weren't on the horizon or perhaps not in your purview that are starting to pop up? Just curious as to, on a time frame, when you might update your CapEx budget based on what projects may or may not have come into the fold.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. No, we're doing that on an ongoing basis, right? We're looking at opportunities and Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer are good examples of things that we think. If they're value-creating, sustainable investments over time, we're going to make those investments. But we think also about, hey, normal course of business, what is the budget and not having any big CapEx bubble. So in this year, for example, the supply chain is challenged on the truck side. And so we're able to pull forward a little bit of spend on heavy equipment this year and some of that truck spend then will flow into next year. So across the two years, it will be relatively balanced. So there's always a little bit of push, pull on the margin, but we're looking at it all the time. And then thinking about into next year, if there's things that are really value creating, we'll put those into the budget next year. But we're kind of giving you what we see in terms of Blue Polymer and Polymer Centers in terms of investments outside of that, including the landfill gas energy projects we've already talked about.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And if you look in the details of the guidance, when we do the reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, included in that is a guide for the capital expenditures. And the number that's in there in the revised guide is exactly the same as what we guided back in February.\nWalter Spracklin: Got it. And last question here is on acquisitions. You had a couple of lumpy \u2013 chunky ones in the quarter. Is it your intention now to digest a little bit as you go into 2024? Or is this something that you think you could keep up a fairly solid clip that even ex those chunkier acquisitions you would have done otherwise?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: No, pipeline remains strong, both on the Recycling and Solid Waste and the Environmental Solutions side of the business. We're mindful of not loading up a specific geography, right, if they've done a big deal. We want to make sure that they can digest that and get that operational. But we've got a good pipeline of deals of all sizes, and we look forward to a strong second half and then into 2024 as well.\nWalter Spracklin: That's fantastic. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. So particularly in light of the way the EBITDA guidance raise was framed in terms of that pricing falling through to the bottom line and relative to the comments in response to Michael's question about raising prices successively each quarter. Just in light of those \u2013 with those as context, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the underlying inflation in the business, how those trended through the quarter, how you're responding, how these pricing programs are responding to those trends?\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yes. Different picture obviously. Labor has been a really good story for us in terms of we brought the turnover down, starting to see that inflation certainly modulate. Maintenance has been a little more of a challenge and it's twofold. Some of it's just the underlying tires or things and true inflation. The other is the challenge of the supply chain, right, while we're growing the business, right, and we're not getting the replacement trucks or the growth trucks we need at the exact clip, that's causing us to drive older trucks, and we're going to do that to service our customer and capture the opportunity. So it's still value creating, but it is going to show up in that maintenance line in terms of older trucks at higher maintenance cost on that front. But we expect broadly all the cost categories, we're starting to see that inflation modulate in the second half of the year. And so we should see pretty good price cost spread at the remainder of the year.\nSean Eastman: Okay. And then maybe taking that a little bit further. Just trying to think about the jumping off point for margins into next year, just assuming kind of status quo on some of the commodity-related inputs. I'm trying to think about the typical 30 to 50 basis points. Should we be building that number off of the second half outlook? As much information or thoughts as you can provide on that bridge would be really appreciated.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Look, we're not providing guidance right now for 2024.\nSean Eastman: Totally understand.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: But again, if you \u2013 when we talk about that kind of 30 to 40 basis points per year, we're doing off of a full-year comp. So again, if you take a look at the midpoint of the EBITDA and the midpoint of the revenue, you can get a baseline adjusted EBITDA margin and think of it off of that because we're saying this year is a relative \u2013 we're expecting a relatively normal level of seasonality. We always expected it to follow the normal seasonal pattern from a margin profile perspective by quarter. So I think if you look at the full-year number, that's a good baseline.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen, and nice update here.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from [Lydia Yang] of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Hi, sorry. This is Noah Kaye on Lydia.\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, Noah.\nNoah Kaye: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe we \u2013 can just to make sure we understand, to put a finer point on the last question, how you think about kind of the yield and margin cadence for the back half. There's some odd comps, obviously, last year to consider versus what feels this year. As you said, more like normal seasonality. So can you maybe help us put a little bit of a finer point on it for modeling purposes?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And again, I would say it had more to do with the prior year than the current year. We always said this year, we expect more of a normal seasonality sequentially. And so again, when you take a look at \u2013 in a normal year, your two best quarters tend to be Q2 and Q3 because you're capturing those summer months, right? And then again, you start pulling in some of the \u2013 in the colder climates where some of the units start to step down, and that's why you see comparably lower margin performance, lower revenue, lower EBITDA in Qs four and one. But as you kind of see this year and you kind of do the math, it looks like second half will be slightly more contribution than the first half, kind of a 49.5%, 50.5% type contribution. And again, we would say that that's relatively in line with our original expectations.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, great. And I think \u2013 by the way, I take your point around higher flow-through on price versus volume and agree with it all day. And so part of just trying to better understand because I think there's been a theme to this earnings around what the volume environment actually looks like. So I just want to make sure I can reconcile something. I think that the guide basically implies flat volumes, right, for the back half. And as you said in your commentary, you're not really looking at a flat volume environment, you're still looking at growth. So just how do I reconcile those? Are you maybe just being a little bit conservative given some of the indicators? Just help us to make sense.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. It's just caution and conservatism, given the construction market, given obviously the manufacturing industry we talk about and just there's some general uncertainty out there have we really stuck the soft landing or not. So we want to be cognizant of that. Listen, we're still raising, right? We've got a great story to tell and very, very positive. But on the volume standpoint, we're just being conservative.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Question on Environmental Solutions. In broad strokes, can you outline what that segment might look like in five years based on your strategy today?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, we expect to keep growing. And this question comes up often, what percentage of the mix is going to be, right? We don't have a target percentage mix. I can tell you that we also plan on growing the recycling and solid waste side of the business. And so whether that is 12%, 14%, 15%, 16%, one year might be outsized one or the other, but we expect it to contribute. And the most important thing for us is it's related, right? It's the thing that's helping us drive cross-sell and stickiness with our customers, not just on the ES side of the business, but in the recycling and solid waste side of the business. So same formula there. We're going to start with price, right? We're going to look to gain organic growth, right, and grow some basis points ahead of the market, but not wildly ahead of the market. And then have a strong M&A pipeline, but stay very disciplined in terms of double-digit returns and make sure that any deal we do there fits our strategy.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you. And second, I guess someone has to ask about PFAS. So with your current environmental solutions capabilities, is PFAS remediation a net positive opportunity today for Republic? Or do you need other pieces to make it that way?\nJon Vander Ark: So we see it as a positive. And again, this is not \u2013 there's \u2013 laws are still evolving here and the regulations are. And so we're actively having discussions at a federal, state and local level, right, to make sure that we're not \u2013 and the industry broadly, right, isn't the one holding the bag or they should want us to take care of PFAS because we're the one collecting it. We didn't generate it or create it. So we're going to be mindful that we're not penalized because we're doing the right thing from the environment. And then you flip that on the ES side of the business, lots of opportunities already emerging and lots of customer discussions for how we remediate. We have some solutions today, that portfolio is going to grow. So we think this is a net positive for us.\nDavid Manthey: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tobey Sommer of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. Can you keep this pace of margin expansion in ES into 2024? And where is the ultimate end goal? Maybe speak to the drivers from this low 20% range.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. The ultimate end goal is to harmonize the financial profile of this business with the recycling solid waste side of the business. We think we first will get their free cash flow conversion because over the cycle, this side of the business has a little less capital intensity and then ultimately margin. We're going to get there in a very disciplined way, right? You won't see the pace of the margin expansion, right, 540 basis points, that's leaps and bounds. We're not going to keep this pace. But I think you're going to see steady progress on that front. And listen, there will be some movement in this business like there is as the economy ebbs and flows, but we're going to take a through-cycle mindset, continue to serve customers, stay disciplined, focus on people who are generating recurring revenue over time. And I think you'll see the financial profile harmonize over time in the two sides of the business.\nTobey Sommer: How much higher can you drive retention above the 94% level and still have it sort of be economically advantageous? And what's driving service delivery improvement now?\nJon Vander Ark: I'll start with the end of your question. Certainly, technology is helping us on that front. As we put in the RISE platform is just allowing \u2013 positioning our frontline people to succeed every day. All the information with the customer is in front of them. When things come up like a block stop, they can immediately communicate digitally to our logistics department through our customer service. So we've got a full visibility and can communicate with the customer quickly. Turnover coming down is certainly helping that, and we feel good about that on the front line of the business. And I don't think we can drive loyalty to 100 because at some point, that's unattractive for certain customers who aren't willing to go or want to go from a price increase. And there is some natural movement of movement of homes, closures of business, et cetera. But we don't think we're done yet. We aspire to take that 94 up higher.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. Last one for me. What are the puts and takes of multiple price hikes per annum as opposed to larger, less frequent price hikes?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, one would be test and learn, right? So when you put out the price increase, right, you can understand exactly how customers react and are we able to retain that work? And so that's the flexibility we have. Over time, you're not going to see us do that. Our normal case in recycling and solid waste business is typically annual increases when extraordinary things happen like the commodity issue four, five years ago, multiple price increases in a year, but that's not normal course. So over time, the ES business will matriculate to that model as well.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you.\nJon Vander Ark: Good afternoon.\nStephanie Moore: Sticking on the move to the ES side and particularly the U.S. Ecology deal. I mean, I think kind of everything that was laid out tonight kind of speaks to the strength you've seen, whether it's pricing or the cross-selling. So suffice it to say, is that $75 million to $100 million revenue synergy target, presumably, we've blown past that at this point? Do you have a new target? Or how would you think about kind of ultimately the opportunity you can continue to garner from a cross-selling and pricing standpoint and what that means for that original target?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Listen, the pipeline is strong. Ultimately, this will manifest itself in our guidance for 2024, which we're not talking about today, but that will roll right. And again, U.S. Ecology, which was a great company. We were lucky to acquire, most importantly, the people, but also those assets. They're now part of the Republic Services in the Environmental Solutions business, so we've anniversaried that going forward. And so you'll see that roll through our volume numbers as we forecast 2024.\nStephanie Moore: Okay, got it. And then maybe switching gears. Can you provide us an update on the joint venture with the BP and on the RNG front, maybe any updates or how it's progressing thus far?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. It's progressing about 57 projects and partnership. The largest chunk of that is with BP. It's 40-plus projects of those are with BP. And listen, we're hitting our marks broadly. Now there's certainly been some push-pull across individual locations where we've had some capital delays in being able to get facilities built. But then we've had other places where we've been able to redirect and pull forward faster and get that permitting in place. So ultimately, we're meeting our expectations for what's going to come online by the end of this year. And I think that's a helpful part of our portfolio, given the number of sites where you have one or two sites that might run into a little bit of delays. You've got the opportunity to look to accelerate other places.\nStephanie Moore: Okay. Got it. So maybe any volatility we've seen with RINs this year and nothing \u2013 that really doesn't have any significant impact with kind of your expectations for this year and next just given the structure of the JV? Is that kind of a fair assessment? Or how would you talk about company volatility?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: From a long-term planning, and we talked about how we were valuing these investments, we assume $2 RIN prices through cycle. So the more recent uptick in RINs prices will actually be upside to our original expectations.\nStephanie Moore: All right. Thank you so much.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Feniger: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just, Brian, the M&A rollover you said next year is 50 basis points. I think typically, M&A ends up being margin dilutive, but some of the acquisitions look like nice assets like Colorado. Just on that 50 bps next year, is there any chance that M&A isn't margin diluted that it could be neutral or even accretive based on some of the assets you guys were able to purchase?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. On a majority of that 50 basis point rollover, we would expect that to be at the margin plus.\nMichael Feniger: Great. And I guess just for my second question, free cash flow is tracking well. I think the conversion is going to be that 44% range in line with last year. I guess with all the conversations about sustainability investments and these projects, just do you think that free cash flow conversion is going to plateau? Or is there an opportunity for next year, for 2024, to see that break out a little bit and step up? What are some things that we should consider that might maybe hold that back or potential upside for that into next year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Well, a couple of things. So I mean your observation of relatively flat with 2022. Be mindful though that we're overcoming over 300 basis points worth of headwinds between higher cash interest rates, commodity prices and the impact of bonus depreciation. So the underlying business is actually offsetting all of that to drive a result that looks relatively flat. That said, the contribution as we start thinking about the RNG plants and we think about Polymer Centers, Blue Polymers, all of which would be accretive to current company performance, that should all be additive. And as long as we don't continue to experience these year-over-year headwinds like we did this year in those three areas I just mentioned, you should start to see that flow through.\nMichael Feniger: Great. And Brian, just maybe just the last one. Just when I look at the open versus restricted pricing, obviously very healthy. How do we kind of think of those moving parts as we go into second half? And any visibility we kind of have in the first half next year just based on how we do the look backs? Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So again, when we think about open market pricing, and we've said this all along that we expected relatively higher pricing in the first half as compared to the second half, not really a function of what we're doing in the current year, it just we'd start getting into tougher comps. And again, it's a year-over-year comparison, so expressed as a percentage. You start to see that modulate a little bit. But again, all staying within, call it, 50 basis points of the full-year guide. So it steps down a little bit. Within the restricted, as we look forward, depends really on the pricing mechanism. So while we see potentially some of the CPI escalators, right, sequentially start to step down, water sewer trash and garbage trash are doing the exact opposite. Each month, they tend to improve. So again, we see it being relatively consistent in the restricted portion of the book just because what we see in step downs in CPI being offset again by those alternative indices.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chiang of CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Yes. Thanks for squeezing. Maybe just one for me. I'm just wondering when you think of ES margins from the low 20s to eventually 30%, it sounds like pricing is tracking well. You've got the cross-selling opportunities. Just you had good success rolling on technology, automation, a bunch of things that have helped improve your solid waste margins. Just wondering how many of those initiatives you've rolled into ES. Or maybe how many of those initiatives would be applicable in the ES segment that could help bridge that gap? And is there a way to maybe quantify how much that could be to margins if you roll out some of that technology to the Environmental Solutions business?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. No, it's a great question. Right now, that's all costs, no benefit. So we're investing a lot in IT and doing a lot of hard integration work. U.S. Ecology, but also ACV and a lot of the other legacy assets we have all in the common platform, starting with a customer, how do we make that service offering even more compelling by getting digitally integrated with them. And then there's certainly some things on the operating side of the business, which will also help us drive labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of material flow, et cetera. We haven't quantified exactly what that's worth yet, but that will be part of the path to get to the 30. And when we get a little further down the road, we'll talk about those initiatives in more detail.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. It's been a long call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Yee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Yee: Hi, good afternoon. I want to ask about the Polymer Centers. So the Las Vegas, Midwest and the two others that you're planning to build, is four kind of the gating factor because of how much plastics you're actually collecting in your recycling routes? Or if there is a lot of demand, would you consider investing in more than four facilities?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Four was \u2013 the business case we based it off of was all the material we collect today. So we don't have supply risk, which is great. Now we built those centers with a capacity to take third-party volume, and we're already getting some of that. So we've created a brokered asset that's already starting to capture some third-party volume, and it's a great value proposition. For example, if you have a municipally owned recycling center, we can take labor out of your facility, right, give you a few more penny for that load, and it's part of your sustainability story as well. So you share in the environmental benefits of that. Over time, right, as that demand for third party continues to grow, we could imagine five or six centers. It's regionally based, all hub-and-spoke model. So we've got the flexibility in the network over time that if the demand outstrips the capacity of the four, that we'll continue to invest.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. That's very helpful. And just on the Blue Polymers JV, can you give us an idea of the CapEx spend that would be coming from Republic? Or is it too early at this point?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Remember, it's more \u2013 we're a minority owner, so it's more an investment then it will come through CapEx. But we're thinking that our allocable share would be about $40 million per facility or $160 million in total over the next five to six years.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jon Vander Ark for any closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Andrea. This month marks the 25th anniversary of Republic Services' stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. I would like to thank all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees, communities and shareholders for their commitment and support in building this great organization. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and the execution of our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business both organically and through acquisitions while enhancing profitability. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 9%, including more than 4% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.5%; expanded EBITDA margin by 40 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41; and produced $1.26 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 10% increase over the prior year. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we invested $927 million of acquisitions, all transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space, including the acquisition of assets in Colorado and New Mexico from GFL. The M&A environment remains active with opportunities in both the recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We now expect investment in value creating acquisitions to exceed $1 billion for the year. We are making great progress on the integration of U.S. Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in this business remains strong. Customers value our complete set of products and services. We have achieved over $110 million in new sales to date as a result of cross-selling our products and services. The sales pipeline is robust with opportunities for organic growth and expansion of services within our existing customer base. We achieved more than $40 million of annualized cost synergies and EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved to more than 22% in the quarter. The strong results we achieved in the first half of the year, along with the positive momentum in our business, supports a full-year financial outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in a range of $14.775 billion to $14.85 billion, adjusted EBITDA in a range of $4.34 billion to $4.36 billion, adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.33 to $5.38 and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion. Our updated financial guidance includes the contribution from acquisitions closed through June 30th. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding Customer Zeal. Our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained over 94% and we continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter and simultaneously increases in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. This includes landfill MSW yield of 6.2%. This is the highest level performance in company history in this category. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 50 basis points. Turning to Digital. We have reached a milestone in our efforts to create digital tools to enhance our customers and employees' experience and deliver meaningful financial benefits. The deployment of RISE tablets in our Recycling and Solid Waste Collection business was completed during the second quarter. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route adherence, improve safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery for our customers. In total, we believe the benefits of our digital initiatives are worth approximately $100 million, with $50 million already achieved and $50 million to be captured over the next three years. Moving on to Sustainability. We continue to invest in differentiating capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. Earlier today, we announced a joint venture with Ravago called Blue Polymers. This groundbreaking partnership further supports our efforts to lead in a plastic circularity. Blue Polymers will utilize recycled olefins from our Polymer Centers to create blended pellets for use in manufacturing sustainable packaging. We expect to open four facilities beginning in late 2024 with earning contribution beginning in 2026. Development of our Polymer Centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on track, with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024, respectively. Demand for recycled plastics remains strong as the consumer goods industry continues to work toward achieving their sustainability goals. For example, we are partnering with a Coca-Cola Company to supply recycled PET from our Polymer Centers for use in sustainable packaging. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect four of these projects to be operational by the end of the third quarter. Finally, we continue to believe that creating a more sustainable world is our responsibility and a platform for growth. We recently published our latest sustainability report, highlighting the progress we are making on our 2030 goals. These goals are supported by investments we are making in Polymer Centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects and fleet electrification. I'll now turn the call over to Brian who will provide details for the quarter. No, it's incremental. So think about that Polymer Center producing two things, PET on one side and olefins on the other side. At the PET, we take into a flake, basically, a hot wash clean flake that's food grade that can go right back into water bottle manufacturing or other types of PET applications. On the olefins, it takes a slightly different path. So we sort, get full collection of that olefins and then we feed the Polymer Center. So this basically guarantees the demand on the back end of our Polymer Center for the olefin side of it. And then Ravago was world-class at compounding and blending olefins to create unique products. And so that's why we partnered with them. We think we can provide the right applications to the market. We get to participate \u2013 not only do we get the supply, so it affects the supply agreement on one side, we get to participate in the benefit and the upside as a 45% minority JV partner. Yes. Look, initially, it won't drop much, at least from a volume standpoint, because what we're really doing with Polymer Center is taking things that are down cycle today and some material along the way in that down cycling is lost and landfilled to get full volume recovery out of that plastic and get much higher yield because they're driving true circularity. Now these Polymer Centers are built actually to take third-party product over time. So over time, we'll flow third-party product in there. That will put more plastic into the system and then dilute the fiber percentage right at a certain level, but you're probably talking more like going from 80 to 75 versus a major change in the mix. Yes. I'd say broadly kind of in line with expectation, probably slightly ahead in certain areas. So construction, we anticipated that being down. We saw residential and commercial starts obviously start to soften the second half of last year. And there's a lag effect as we have jobs that are getting completed. And so we're down 3.8%, but we have really strong pricing there. So we've taken the opportunity there to be disciplined on price and making sure that we're getting a positive mix even in that environment. And then other special waste, right, is attractive. Part of that special waste clearly is our cross-sell initiatives. With the U.S. Ecology acquisition, we have now a unique offering in the marketplace, and we're seeing customers demand to that unique offering. So that's certainly helping us. Small container was a bright spot, right, in terms of volume growth for the quarter. So I feel really good about that as well. And again, I'd say broadly in line with what we expected. Yes, Coca-Cola has been a great partner. I would say this, demand for our product out of the Polymer Center outstrip supply by a lot, right? So we were able to talk to a number of parties. We could have sold the Las Vegas center out three or four times over without challenges because the market is so short supplied for this type of ARPA that's food grade. And we're taking it right now, the single site over time, we'll take the Midwest side. And then these partnerships will evolve, and I'm certain they'll grow, right, as we expand the network, but that's all we're disclosing at this point. Hey, Tyler. Yes. Let me answer the question. The short story is that the entire increase is essentially the underlying business. So let me go through some of the puts and takes. So to your point, right, we've added EBITDA associated with acquisitions, but most of those acquisitions were completed mid-year. So you're going to have half the contribution. We've also got deal and integration costs. Two of these deals require regulatory filings, so we had heavy legal costs. We also have a fairly significant integration costs just because one of those deals requires that we rebrand the trucks within the first six months. So the contributions from acquisitions in here is still positive, but it's somewhat muted. To your point, that's been further offset by the reduction in recycled commodity prices. So if you think about taking all those things I just mentioned relative to our original guide, it's a relative push. The $50 million increase in EBITDA at the midpoint is essentially the increase in price flowing through to the bottom line. Yes. Let me go ahead and start. You had a couple of questions there, so we'll kind of unpack some of those. So the expected contribution from just the Polymer Center, right, so this is the one in Vegas in 2024 is $15 million, right, of EBITDA contribution in 2024. You can then think of about an incremental $20 million per year thereafter, right, as we bring other centers online, ultimately getting to about $80 million worth of EBITDA at run rate in 2028. To your other point, right, on the Blue Polymers, yes, we are going to be selling all of the olefins coming out of the Polymer Center 2, the Blue Polymers JV, right? And when you start thinking about the offtake agreement there that guarantees, right, a contractual rate for all of those units leaving Blue Polymers on the olefin side \u2013 or I'm sorry, Polymer Center on the olefin side. Yes. Correct. Sure. Yes. We're certainly starting with price, right? That's always the first component, right? We have to price ahead of our costs. You've seen the organic growth picture. And the underlying solid waste and recycling business is a slow growth business, right? And we expect to grow slightly faster than the market, only slightly because it's a highly contracted market and shares don't move easily. And again, we're always going to stay disciplined on price first. As we've expanded into Environmental Solutions, the underlying growth from an organic standpoint is certainly a little stronger. So that's a tailwind. On the growth side, we're doing more M&A than we ever had. It was six or seven years ago, we talked about spending $100 million a year in M&A. And then that's been ramped up to $500 million to $700 million, and obviously, we had announced last year the U.S. Ecology acquisition and got to $3 billion. But even outside of U.S. Ecology, it's $800 million of deals outside of U.S. Ecology. And this year, we've said more than $1 billion, and we're already sniffing up against that number. So M&A is certainly contributing. And then our other sustainability investments, right, are nice contributors and probably a little less on the topline in terms of really moving the needle given the scale of the business. But on the bottom line, right, these are kind of high EBITDA margin investment opportunity, very high return. So we feel great about that over time. Yes, let me start there, Michael. We're working through that. Obviously, it's a little bit like special waste in terms of there's a mix issue that there's a lot of unique products and services. So we haven't nailed yet what we might report externally in terms of price or yield metric there, certainly our aspiration over time, whether that's large parts of the business, like yield per drum or things like that, work through it. But a huge portion of the outperformance there is price. We've taken multiple double-digit price increases, and we will lead from a pricing standpoint. And that's caused a few units to be shed in certain places. So we found the ceiling, but we're unafraid. These are valuable assets, impossible to replicate and customers are valuing what we're offering. So we're going to continue to push on that front. And that, also combined with the cross-sell, which is where we're driving a lot of the volume, has been a really good story and picture for that business. Yes. I think, yes. And so we look at all those indices, too, Michael. And I think what we're not fully accounting for is a lot of the infrastructure spend and the government spending is flowing through. And we're certainly getting a lot of opportunity there. We are actually in the process of raising prices here early in 3Q. No, we haven't seen it. Now again, there's always an ankle biter and a market here or there who's going to take advantage of try to grow volume and figure out pretty quickly, right? That's a tough way to make a business and earn your cost of capital. With a small container, right, 9.5% yield, 1.4% volume. Really, really strong numbers for us this quarter. And that's a place we often see the price competition come in. That's where they try to attack because that's a profitable part of the business and people try to build their business there. They might start out on resi script or start out and temporal off and then they quickly get into that because that's the higher margin stuff. And so we've not seen the market broadly turn into a negative direction at all. Yes. No, we're doing that on an ongoing basis, right? We're looking at opportunities and Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer are good examples of things that we think. If they're value-creating, sustainable investments over time, we're going to make those investments. But we think also about, hey, normal course of business, what is the budget and not having any big CapEx bubble. So in this year, for example, the supply chain is challenged on the truck side. And so we're able to pull forward a little bit of spend on heavy equipment this year and some of that truck spend then will flow into next year. So across the two years, it will be relatively balanced. So there's always a little bit of push, pull on the margin, but we're looking at it all the time. And then thinking about into next year, if there's things that are really value creating, we'll put those into the budget next year. But we're kind of giving you what we see in terms of Blue Polymer and Polymer Centers in terms of investments outside of that, including the landfill gas energy projects we've already talked about. Thank you. Sure. Yes. Different picture obviously. Labor has been a really good story for us in terms of we brought the turnover down, starting to see that inflation certainly modulate. Maintenance has been a little more of a challenge and it's twofold. Some of it's just the underlying tires or things and true inflation. The other is the challenge of the supply chain, right, while we're growing the business, right, and we're not getting the replacement trucks or the growth trucks we need at the exact clip, that's causing us to drive older trucks, and we're going to do that to service our customer and capture the opportunity. So it's still value creating, but it is going to show up in that maintenance line in terms of older trucks at higher maintenance cost on that front. But we expect broadly all the cost categories, we're starting to see that inflation modulate in the second half of the year. And so we should see pretty good price cost spread at the remainder of the year. Thank you. Hey, Noah. Yes, we expect to keep growing. And this question comes up often, what percentage of the mix is going to be, right? We don't have a target percentage mix. I can tell you that we also plan on growing the recycling and solid waste side of the business. And so whether that is 12%, 14%, 15%, 16%, one year might be outsized one or the other, but we expect it to contribute. And the most important thing for us is it's related, right? It's the thing that's helping us drive cross-sell and stickiness with our customers, not just on the ES side of the business, but in the recycling and solid waste side of the business. So same formula there. We're going to start with price, right? We're going to look to gain organic growth, right, and grow some basis points ahead of the market, but not wildly ahead of the market. And then have a strong M&A pipeline, but stay very disciplined in terms of double-digit returns and make sure that any deal we do there fits our strategy. So we see it as a positive. And again, this is not \u2013 there's \u2013 laws are still evolving here and the regulations are. And so we're actively having discussions at a federal, state and local level, right, to make sure that we're not \u2013 and the industry broadly, right, isn't the one holding the bag or they should want us to take care of PFAS because we're the one collecting it. We didn't generate it or create it. So we're going to be mindful that we're not penalized because we're doing the right thing from the environment. And then you flip that on the ES side of the business, lots of opportunities already emerging and lots of customer discussions for how we remediate. We have some solutions today, that portfolio is going to grow. So we think this is a net positive for us. Yes. The ultimate end goal is to harmonize the financial profile of this business with the recycling solid waste side of the business. We think we first will get their free cash flow conversion because over the cycle, this side of the business has a little less capital intensity and then ultimately margin. We're going to get there in a very disciplined way, right? You won't see the pace of the margin expansion, right, 540 basis points, that's leaps and bounds. We're not going to keep this pace. But I think you're going to see steady progress on that front. And listen, there will be some movement in this business like there is as the economy ebbs and flows, but we're going to take a through-cycle mindset, continue to serve customers, stay disciplined, focus on people who are generating recurring revenue over time. And I think you'll see the financial profile harmonize over time in the two sides of the business. I'll start with the end of your question. Certainly, technology is helping us on that front. As we put in the RISE platform is just allowing \u2013 positioning our frontline people to succeed every day. All the information with the customer is in front of them. When things come up like a block stop, they can immediately communicate digitally to our logistics department through our customer service. So we've got a full visibility and can communicate with the customer quickly. Turnover coming down is certainly helping that, and we feel good about that on the front line of the business. And I don't think we can drive loyalty to 100 because at some point, that's unattractive for certain customers who aren't willing to go or want to go from a price increase. And there is some natural movement of movement of homes, closures of business, et cetera. But we don't think we're done yet. We aspire to take that 94 up higher. Well, one would be test and learn, right? So when you put out the price increase, right, you can understand exactly how customers react and are we able to retain that work? And so that's the flexibility we have. Over time, you're not going to see us do that. Our normal case in recycling and solid waste business is typically annual increases when extraordinary things happen like the commodity issue four, five years ago, multiple price increases in a year, but that's not normal course. So over time, the ES business will matriculate to that model as well. Good afternoon. Yes. Listen, the pipeline is strong. Ultimately, this will manifest itself in our guidance for 2024, which we're not talking about today, but that will roll right. And again, U.S. Ecology, which was a great company. We were lucky to acquire, most importantly, the people, but also those assets. They're now part of the Republic Services in the Environmental Solutions business, so we've anniversaried that going forward. And so you'll see that roll through our volume numbers as we forecast 2024. Yes. It's progressing about 57 projects and partnership. The largest chunk of that is with BP. It's 40-plus projects of those are with BP. And listen, we're hitting our marks broadly. Now there's certainly been some push-pull across individual locations where we've had some capital delays in being able to get facilities built. But then we've had other places where we've been able to redirect and pull forward faster and get that permitting in place. So ultimately, we're meeting our expectations for what's going to come online by the end of this year. And I think that's a helpful part of our portfolio, given the number of sites where you have one or two sites that might run into a little bit of delays. You've got the opportunity to look to accelerate other places. Thank you. Yes. No, it's a great question. Right now, that's all costs, no benefit. So we're investing a lot in IT and doing a lot of hard integration work. U.S. Ecology, but also ACV and a lot of the other legacy assets we have all in the common platform, starting with a customer, how do we make that service offering even more compelling by getting digitally integrated with them. And then there's certainly some things on the operating side of the business, which will also help us drive labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of material flow, et cetera. We haven't quantified exactly what that's worth yet, but that will be part of the path to get to the 30. And when we get a little further down the road, we'll talk about those initiatives in more detail. Yes. Four was \u2013 the business case we based it off of was all the material we collect today. So we don't have supply risk, which is great. Now we built those centers with a capacity to take third-party volume, and we're already getting some of that. So we've created a brokered asset that's already starting to capture some third-party volume, and it's a great value proposition. For example, if you have a municipally owned recycling center, we can take labor out of your facility, right, give you a few more penny for that load, and it's part of your sustainability story as well. So you share in the environmental benefits of that. Over time, right, as that demand for third party continues to grow, we could imagine five or six centers. It's regionally based, all hub-and-spoke model. So we've got the flexibility in the network over time that if the demand outstrips the capacity of the four, that we'll continue to invest. Thank you, Andrea. This month marks the 25th anniversary of Republic Services' stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. I would like to thank all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees, communities and shareholders for their commitment and support in building this great organization. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.3%. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 11% and restricted pricing of 5.3%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.8% and residential of 8.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 40 basis points, while volume on related revenue increased 50 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.4%, an increase in residential of 80 basis points, and an increase in landfill of 3.7%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.3%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. Moving on to Recycling. Commodity prices were $119 per ton during the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 1.1% during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe commodity prices will remain relatively flat with current levels in the second half of the year and we now expect average recycled commodity prices in a range of $110 to $115 per ton for the full-year. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $104 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of U.S. Ecology. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.5%, a sequential increase of more than 150 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 30% during the quarter. Margin performance included a 50 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which was fully overcome by a 100 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 20 basis points. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.26 billion. Our performance through the first half benefited from the timing of capital expenditures and cash taxes. Year-to-date, capital expenditures of $550 million represents 33% of our projected full-year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $99 million, represents 40% of our projected full-year spend. Total debt was $12.2 billion and total liquidity was $2.1 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter returned to approximately 3x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.8% during the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 25% in the second half of the year, resulting in a full-year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Yes. From an economics perspective, we look at our equity pickup, that one line pickup, beginning in 2026 two centers somewhat contributing in that year with about $15 million. So you can think $7 million to $8 million per center. And then getting $7 million to $8 million incremental in both 2027 and 2028. Ultimately, we see $30 million to $32 million worth of EBITDA for all four at run rate in 2029. Yes. And Toni, if you remember, in our original guidance, the range on volume was 50 basis points to 1% positive. And now we're thinking it's at that \u2013 still within the range, but at the lower end. But at the same time, we increased our guidance on average yields, right? So the flow-through and the contribution of a 50 basis point increase on yield is much more significant to the enterprise in our results than the 50 basis point decrease on the volume side. Yes. So the in-year contribution rollover from 2022 transactions as well as the in-year impact from 2023 transactions, we're thinking 4.25%, right? And the rollover impact into 2024, right, from the deals that were completed in 2023, we think adds 50 basis points to our 2024 revenue growth. Look, I would say there's always some puts and takes. But I would say if you aggregate those from a net number perspective, it was a fairly clean quarter. Yes, the guide. So, Michael, as I mentioned, I mean, we're not going to get into the individual components of the EBITDA contribution of our acquisitions and other things. But what I can tell you is, as I just said with Tyler on the phone, if you take a look at the in-year acquisition contribution net of those deal and integration costs, right, that is a positive number, which is almost entirely offset by the reduction in recycled commodities. That reduction in recycled commodities is about $15 million to $20 million negative compared to our original expectations. So if you look at guide to guide right at the midpoint, our EBITDA is up $50 million, which is the underlying business made up primarily of relatively higher price. We took our yield from 5.5% on total revenue to 6%. We took it from 6.5% on related to 7%. So that's that 50 basis points as well as just outperformance within the Environmental Solutions business. That's what's contributing, right, to the overall increase in EBITDA. Yes. I mean just to put some numbers on that, Michael. If you take a look at the Environmental Solutions business, this time last year, was 17.1% EBITDA margin. This quarter, 22.5%. So that 540 basis points of margin improvement is essentially most of that being price-driven, but also just better overall utilization as well. We're becoming more efficient, and we're optimizing from a labor perspective. So when we do get those units, not just because of the price alone, but as far as the overall profitability of each one of those jobs, we're just becoming overall more efficient as we have better utilization of the assets and the resources that are providing those services. And I think the other thing, too, Michael, that we're also seeing right now as well is the benefit of the cross-sell. As we said, we've now increased \u2013 or reported more than $110 million in new sales, which is positively impacting both the Environmental Solutions business as well as the Recycling and Solid Waste business. But more of that positively impacting the Environmental Solutions business just because when you take a look at the revenue per customer tends to just be higher than we see in recycling and solid waste. And the other thing, too, you have to remember is that there are still supply chain constraints on getting new trucks. So in order to sit there into, again, have that type of behavior, you'd have to have capacity in your system or be able to secure a new truck in order to service those new accounts. And we are not seeing those supply chain constraints easing anytime soon. And if you look in the details of the guidance, when we do the reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, included in that is a guide for the capital expenditures. And the number that's in there in the revised guide is exactly the same as what we guided back in February. No, pipeline remains strong, both on the Recycling and Solid Waste and the Environmental Solutions side of the business. We're mindful of not loading up a specific geography, right, if they've done a big deal. We want to make sure that they can digest that and get that operational. But we've got a good pipeline of deals of all sizes, and we look forward to a strong second half and then into 2024 as well. Yes. Look, we're not providing guidance right now for 2024. But again, if you \u2013 when we talk about that kind of 30 to 40 basis points per year, we're doing off of a full-year comp. So again, if you take a look at the midpoint of the EBITDA and the midpoint of the revenue, you can get a baseline adjusted EBITDA margin and think of it off of that because we're saying this year is a relative \u2013 we're expecting a relatively normal level of seasonality. We always expected it to follow the normal seasonal pattern from a margin profile perspective by quarter. So I think if you look at the full-year number, that's a good baseline. And again, I would say it had more to do with the prior year than the current year. We always said this year, we expect more of a normal seasonality sequentially. And so again, when you take a look at \u2013 in a normal year, your two best quarters tend to be Q2 and Q3 because you're capturing those summer months, right? And then again, you start pulling in some of the \u2013 in the colder climates where some of the units start to step down, and that's why you see comparably lower margin performance, lower revenue, lower EBITDA in Qs four and one. But as you kind of see this year and you kind of do the math, it looks like second half will be slightly more contribution than the first half, kind of a 49.5%, 50.5% type contribution. And again, we would say that that's relatively in line with our original expectations. Yes. It's just caution and conservatism, given the construction market, given obviously the manufacturing industry we talk about and just there's some general uncertainty out there have we really stuck the soft landing or not. So we want to be cognizant of that. Listen, we're still raising, right? We've got a great story to tell and very, very positive. But on the volume standpoint, we're just being conservative. From a long-term planning, and we talked about how we were valuing these investments, we assume $2 RIN prices through cycle. So the more recent uptick in RINs prices will actually be upside to our original expectations. Yes. On a majority of that 50 basis point rollover, we would expect that to be at the margin plus. Yes. Well, a couple of things. So I mean your observation of relatively flat with 2022. Be mindful though that we're overcoming over 300 basis points worth of headwinds between higher cash interest rates, commodity prices and the impact of bonus depreciation. So the underlying business is actually offsetting all of that to drive a result that looks relatively flat. That said, the contribution as we start thinking about the RNG plants and we think about Polymer Centers, Blue Polymers, all of which would be accretive to current company performance, that should all be additive. And as long as we don't continue to experience these year-over-year headwinds like we did this year in those three areas I just mentioned, you should start to see that flow through. Yes. So again, when we think about open market pricing, and we've said this all along that we expected relatively higher pricing in the first half as compared to the second half, not really a function of what we're doing in the current year, it just we'd start getting into tougher comps. And again, it's a year-over-year comparison, so expressed as a percentage. You start to see that modulate a little bit. But again, all staying within, call it, 50 basis points of the full-year guide. So it steps down a little bit. Within the restricted, as we look forward, depends really on the pricing mechanism. So while we see potentially some of the CPI escalators, right, sequentially start to step down, water sewer trash and garbage trash are doing the exact opposite. Each month, they tend to improve. So again, we see it being relatively consistent in the restricted portion of the book just because what we see in step downs in CPI being offset again by those alternative indices. Remember, it's more \u2013 we're a minority owner, so it's more an investment then it will come through CapEx. But we're thinking that our allocable share would be about $40 million per facility or $160 million in total over the next five to six years."

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the year strong and are pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance reflects our ability to grow across our business while enhancing profitability. We remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace by providing the most complete set of products and services to customers. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, including 11% from acquisitions, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and produced $496 million of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. We invested $224 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. All transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of outsized levels of activity in both recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for well over $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2023. We are making great progress on the integration of U.S. Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. We continue to adjust prices to earn an appropriate return on the valuable services we provide. The acceptance of our pricing actions remains high with very little customer defection. Cross-selling our complete set of products and services continues to run ahead of plan with more than $60 million in new sales to date. We have now achieved over $40 million of annualized cost savings. As a result of the actions taken in the Environmental Solutions business, EBITDA margin improved to just over 20% during the first quarter. We continue to generate outsized growth by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding customers' yield. We remain laser-focused on providing a world-class customer experience to drive increased loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained at 94%. We continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Our front-end colleagues, including drivers, technicians and the customer experience team are determined to fulfill our daily commitments to our customers. We delivered robust organic revenue growth during the quarter and simultaneously increased in both price and volume. For price and related revenue increased to 9.3% and average yield on related revenue increased to 7.4%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 1.8%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Turning to digital, we continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. Over 75% of our residential routes are operating with RISE tablets. The remaining routes are on-track to be completed by mid-year. This technology is the foundation that will allow us to further enhance our digital service offerings and improve our customer experience. Moving on to sustainability. We are investing in differentiated capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. In February, we announced our plans to significantly scale our electric fleet through our long-term agreement with Oshkosh. We will begin operating 2 fully integrated electric recycling and solid waste collection prototypes later this year and expect to start buying a scale in 2025. This announcement supports our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification through a multi-supplier strategy. Development of our Palmer centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on-track with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024 respectively. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect at least six of these projects to commence operations this year. Our approach to sustainability includes our aspiration to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve, and we are seeing positive results. Turnover rates continue to improve, and we are now below 2019 levels. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. We continue to be widely recognized for our comprehensive sustainability performance. For example, we were recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies list and Fortune's list of the world's Most Admired Companies. A positive momentum in our business continues to build as we harness the power of our differentiated capabilities. We will continue to invest for the future profitable growth to deliver the results that create unmistakable value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide financial details for the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 8.2%. Core price on related revenue was 9.3%, which included open market pricing of 11.7% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.6%, large container of 9.6% and residential of 8.4%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.5%. Average yield on related revenue was 7.4%, an increase of 70 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 1.6%, while volume on related revenue increased 1.8%. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.6%. an increase in large container of 80 basis points and an increase in landfill of 8.6%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 21.7% increase in special waste revenue. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $105 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $201 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 90 basis points during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe that commodity prices will continue to recover in the second half of the year as the global supply/demand imbalance continues to correct. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $309 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 20.6%, a sequential increase of 350 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 29%. This compares to 30.4% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which includes 90 basis points related to US Ecology, 60 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from an additional work day, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 40 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow was $496 million in the first quarter or approximately 25% of the midpoint of our full year guidance. Free cash flow conversion was 47.6%. Total debt was $12.1 billion, and total liquidity was $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.1x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.3% during the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. With that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Hi, there. Thanks so much. Pricing seemed really strong this quarter. I know you talked about it sort of decelerating through the year, but just wanted to get your latest thoughts. Any additional color on pricing and how second quarter looks as well? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, certainly a very strong environment still. We expect kind of maintain that momentum for the first half and for lots of reasons, we think that sequentially comes down into the second half, right, as some inflation starts to modulate and in our restricted portion of our business, obviously, right, CPI comes down in terms of where the comps go, but we also expect cost inflation to modulate through the year. So we think we'll have pretty good price margin spread throughout the year, which will lead to a positive result for the year.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And I wanted to ask if you could just give us an update on how you are thinking about the specialty waste opportunity, talk about any of the synergies and areas of potential future opportunity there. Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, a really strong quarter for us, obviously, right, over 20% and broad-based, and a portion of that is certainly the cross-sell opportunities that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And that we're offering customers a comprehensive and integrated offering and part of that is showing up in our recycling and solid waste business and going to our special waste into our landfill. And that's the benefit of our offering where we can take things into liquid hazardous waste, we can take solid hazardous waste, we can take special way so we can provide a range of solutions to customers, and that still put us in a pretty differentiated position in the marketplace and excited about the momentum that the team has.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. And also what I would add to that is that our pipeline for special waste opportunities remains very strong. And about 20% of that pipeline is a direct result of cross-sell opportunities.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Congrats, again.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Brown: Hey, good afternoon guys. Sorry, I just want to be clear. So are you effectively just reiterating all the pieces of the guidance?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, we feel we're certainly -- feel good about the guidance at this point.\nPatrick Brown: Okay. Okay. This wasn't totally 100% clear. But kind of going back and following on the previous question, I know pricing was strong out of the gate. But can you talk a little bit about unit cost inflation? So I think you guys guided to something like 5% to 5.5% unit cost inflation for '23, I think on the last quarter call. Do you kind of still see that or you still seeing maybe inflation starting high and then it kind of easiness as the year goes on?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, start where you ended. It's certainly starting higher and modulating throughout the course of the year. I think it's going to be a little higher than the 5.5%, probably closer to 6% would be our best look at this point right now and a few different factors on that. Certainly, truck delivery would be one where we got about 90% of our trucks last year, and we think we're going to get probably that 10% from last year and about 90% of this year, and we're growing. So that means we're buying some older trucks. Operating some older trucks to service those growth opportunities, and they have a higher cost per engine hour. And so that's elevated maintenance costs. It's higher cost, not necessarily unit cost inflation on the part, for example, is just operating more expensive vehicles. And hopefully, in 2024, the suppliers catch up, but we can kind of get back on track. So that would be one example why it's just a little bit higher than we predicted.\nPatrick Brown: Okay. All right. That's perfect. Just my last one is here. Going back to environmental services. So there's a lot of traction there. It seems like that franchise is maybe run rating $1.5 billion in total revenues, and I don't have the calculation on the fingertips here. But is that kind of like a low-low 20% margin today. I think you had talked about maybe getting that to 30% longer term. So do you still see that, Jon? And kind of what are the couple of the key drivers to get you there? Is it just we need to go through a couple more cycles of pricing? Or just any thoughts on timing and how we go from call 20 to circa 30.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Listen, I think pricing is certainly going to be a huge lever in terms of how we get there and the primary lever. I think a little bit of scale benefit, obviously, which allows us to leverage our overhead. We've built this thing for growth. So as we continue to grow, we get some leverage on our overhead spend in that space as well. And just additional integration opportunities across recycling and solid waste business. We haven't really taken advantage of all of those things yet. And then, the last thing will be just cost management. Cost discipline and making sure that we are pricing work appropriately in understanding the cost position of all that work so that all of our individual opportunities and projects are profitable. We've made great progress on that, but there's more room in front of us. And this was the investment thesis when we did the deal, obvious. So we did it based on Intrinsic and $40 million of cost synergies we've just gotten there quicker than we expected. We've gotten the 40 rate. I think we're going to end up closer to 50, when we're said and done. And then, we thought there was upward pressure on pricing. We thought there was cross-sell opportunities. And we said we'd get $75 million to $100 million over 3 years. We've already gotten 60, which tells you with a good pipeline, which tells you that we're going to get to that 75 to 100 quicker than we expected. And we know that when we price, so we anticipate there will be some customer fallout churn, but the net dollars work over time. We've just seen very, very little churn, which speaks to the fact that this is a valuable offering. It's a very small portion of the vast majority of our customers' cost structure and that we're going to continue to price for the value we deliver.\nPatrick Brown: Yes. Lots of momentum there. Appreciate the time guys. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. There's been maybe some mixed messages today in earnings -- previous earnings around the macro, the health of the macro. I have a feeling your answer may be not so mixed, maybe a little more unambiguous. But can you talk today about the health of the customer, the sustainability of your pricing? You mentioned that your retention rates are at 94%. So they're sticking. But looking at your -- both the pricing and some of the volume trends you reported, they're very robust. And so would just love your perspective on what you're seeing in the staying power of some of these trends.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Let me put a caveat on first, which is we remain humble and dynamic, right? The last 3 years have bought a lot of people that there's fundamental uncertainty in the market and I read the same things you do, which is people have been talking about a recession, you're announced for 12 to 18 months. So we have our eyes and ears open and that will be nimble should that occur. All that being said, we see a lot of positive signs. We're seeing strong growth and pricing. Let me give you a number or a perspective. In our open market, we're sending out more -- a higher gross price increase than we ever had before. and our realization rate, which is the percentage of that pricing that sticks. Customers don't call back to negotiate, et cetera, is the highest it's ever been, which is somewhat of an astounding number to think about, they were putting a lot of price. That price is sticking in the marketplace for growing. We talked about special waste in that pipeline being strong. We're starting to see a commodity rebound, which we put a modest rebound in our plan, and I think we feel really good that the outlook there looks strong on that front. We've seen a little decline in temp units year-over-year. We anticipated that in our plan with where residential and commercial construction were going at the end of last year, but our yield number is very, very strong there. So we're doing some of that to ourselves in terms of yielding on those assets. So we're pretty confident in the very near term and cautiously optimistic around the demand environment for the remainder of the year.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. And then maybe just a little bit of a follow-on, but also housekeeping. Can you comment to what MSW tons did? And then did the quarter have any benefit on the cleanup related to the train derailment in Ohio? I don't know if remediation work ended up being significant.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Let me address the MSW. So MSW volume was up 1.2%. I think more importantly, though, MSW yield was up 5.6%. So very strong pricing in that portion of our business.\nJon Vander Ark: And then the specific to derailment in Ohio, I think is the one you're referring to, a de minimis impact in the quarter.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. So it was really all just strong demand in kind of the environmental services part of the business. And can you give us sort of a sense of how much of that was price?\nJon Vander Ark: Very strong, very broad-based. Listen, we've gone out with multiple double-digit price increases, which is sticking. Obviously, that business is more unique, and there's a lot of mix elements because you're doing a lot of individual project work and a lot of things like special waste on the hazard side that come in. So we haven't yet developed our yield metric, which we aspire to do over time in that portion of the business. And I'd say the industrial economy from our seat in the park is still very strong. Now it's not universally strong on boarded, for example, would be a spot that's a little bit down. So we're seeing some of that in the Midwest, which has a lot of manufacturing capacity there, but other parts are very, very strong on the industrial side.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much operator. Good afternoon everyone. I wanted to go back to the recession question and really talk about I know your resiliency is quite admirable during the cycle. Just curious with you have a little bit of a different book of business now compared to '08, '09. And just wondering what your thoughts are on whether the resiliency of your earnings profile is as good as it was back then or if the addition of US Ecology has added any volatility there? And particularly on special waste, I don't know if you've answered many questions about your sensitivity to a recessionary environment on your special waste volumes, if you have any color on that?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Walter, I would say the first thing to keep in perspective is that Environmental Solutions revenue in total is about 10% of our book. You got to keep that in mind. That being said, a good portion of this revenue stream is, as a consistent and recurring nature to it. And increasingly more, we're trying to get closer to the customer to make that more of an annuity type revenue stream. Is it exactly the same? Maybe not, but is it pretty close, I would say yes.\nWalter Spracklin: And sensitivity on special waste, any sense there?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I think you got moving pieces there. Obviously, when the economy goes down, people will get cautious and things that have discretion to them, you're going to see some delays. But the vast majority of our special waste those are jobs that need to get completed. They need to get done. So it's not a matter of the job getting canceled. It's a matter of the job getting pushed. And I'd say the counterbalance of that right now is just all of the infrastructure spending and government funding. We see a lot of those opportunities just starting to emerge, but we really haven't taken advantage of a lot of that spending hasn't flowed all the way through to jobs being committed here.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. Those are my two questions. Thanks very much. Appreciate your time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJon Vander Ark: Operator, why don't we move on to the next question.\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Nice start to the year. I kind of hate to do this. But just pressing on the guidance, I mean not much of a mention on kind of where we stand, to me kind of feels like we are running ahead schedule. So I just wanted to run that by you, is it fair to say that perhaps with the momentum in environmental solutions. Clearly, price volume looking stronger that we are kind of tracking a little ahead of that initial outlook for the year.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We feel really good about the start to the business and said what remains quiet positive as you know, it's a seasonal business, so you get a ramp-up here in Q2 and Q3. And we want to see that ramp-up fully take hold. We are starting certainly see some of that ready but that gets into full swing here in May and the summer month in the northern part of the country. And so we'll come back in July when we talk again and see our progress there, and we'll tell you if we have any update at that point.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Understood. And perhaps the moving parts on the year-on-year margin bridge in the first quarter would be helpful to assess. I mean, did those kind of commodity inputs come through as expected? That one would be good to jump into.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. From a commodity perspective, we're tracking almost exactly the way that we thought we would. So we thought we would start the year right around this, call it, $100 a ton, sequentially increasing with a full year average of about $125 per ton. And so right now, we would say with what we saw in the first quarter on average plus where current prices are at $115 per ton. It's playing out exactly the way we thought it would. And so when you think about the margin cadence of that, in this quarter, it was a 60 basis point headwind. We think it's a relatively consistent headwind in Q2. That drops to, call it, a 20 basis point headwind in Q3 and then flip positive in Q4 at those levels.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Perfect. And one last quick one for me. I just want to make sure I understand this big special waste print in the quarter. I mean, are you guys saying that as a reflection of the cross-sell opportunity really coming through on the Environmental Solutions strategy?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Certainly in part. That's why you're going to see it. When you actually sell into the recycling and solid waste business, what you're going to see is that's where a good portion of it is going to come in. That's a lot of the volume aspect of it. But at the same time, we're seeing that -- again, we're talking about total revenue being up about 22%. It's a pretty good split between both price and volume. So it's a combination of both, and that's going to be a reflection again of just healthy activity, which includes the benefits of that cross-sell.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Understood. I appreciate the insight guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to touch a little bit on the M&A environment. I think you noted that you expected to execute on. I think close to $500 million in M&A this year and not included in the guidance. So maybe if you just wanted to touch on what you've seen for the first quarter of the year and kind of any changes or expectations there? And I know you noted that a lot of those acquisitions is in the recycling and solid waste business. But what about more so in the specialty waste? Is that an opportunity this year as well?\nJon Vander Ark: So yes, we put out in our initial guidance. We anticipated spending $500 million. I think we'll exceed that number as we go throughout the year. We have a really attractive pipeline, both in recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions. And so I think you'll see some of those deals come across through the remainder of the year, and we get things are at different stages. We're all the way in the front end of conversations to the back end of letters of intent, and we report on things once we sign and close those deals. So you'll hear more in the second quarter. And the exact timing of where that flows between Q2, Q3 and Q4, obviously, we don't predict that because things can people forward or they can move out a few months here or there. The pipeline remains strong. I think both for '23 and all the way into '24 at this point. We feel really good about the pipeline.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. And then maybe touching back on the pricing and the cost environment as well. And you just noted on 2024. And obviously, a lot of things could happen between here and there. But how would you think about that just general structural spread cost between pricing cost as we move through 2024, given some of the maybe headwinds this year and what next year in theory could be a more normalized environment, if that exists anymore, but how would you view just how that spread has changed over time versus maybe historically?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Look, we remain committed to pricing ahead of our cost inflation to allow us to expand margins across the business. So we've talked about 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion that's kind of the pace that we go after, and that would be our initial ingoing assumption in 2024. Now a lot can change between now and then in terms of could we get more than that, if we can do that and maintain and improve the health of our overall business, we'll certainly do that, but more to come down the road here on 2024 perspective.\nStephanie Moore: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. Please go ahead.\nTony Bancroft: Thanks so much for the opportunity, a very nice quarter. Just a question on PFAS. Could you just sort of review, I know there's a lot of news, articles coming out about that right now and some potential rulings and some regulation coming out. Just maybe review what that potentially means for you in landfill cost structure, potential opportunities, maybe that would be helpful.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Very important regulation. And again, we're not opposed to regulation, we happen if it's well constructed, so we have a seat at that table. And we're involved in those conversations to make sure that we don't, as a company, or even an industry get penalized for something that we catch. We didn't create the problem. People should be happy that we've got the modern infrastructure and systems to protect the environment. Net-net, we see it as more of an opportunity over time, especially with our Environmental Solutions business and being able to serve customers. Could that have some elevated costs in our landfill, Yes, we've got a really good history of passing those types of costs, regulatory costs. on to customers. And so more to come on that as we move forward. But we're very much in the conversation and we'll be active in shaping the legislation in a way that it enhances the business versus penalizes the business.\nTony Bancroft: Thank you for that. And then I guess my second one, just on electrification. You touched on in your comments. Just maybe again, an update on that. You've talked about in the past, but how is that going? There's been some, I think people are talking about infrastructure issues and making it all sort of work. What's your view on? Is it on track? Is it off track? Or just maybe you could give us some thoughts on that.\nJon Vander Ark: Still very much on track. We've got more than 20 trucks right around the country right now that are electrified through multiple manufacturers. We talked about our Oshkosh partnership and that the first kind of bottoms up zero emission designed vehicle and excited about that. And that number of 20 will go north of 50 next year, by 2025, we'll have several hundred vehicles. And it is important. It's not just the vehicle, it's the system. So you need to have the infrastructure, you need to have understanding government regulations, you need to understand the incentives, and we've been working for years on those things and have multiple infrastructure projects already going on, anticipating where we're going to put vehicles in working closely with customers. So we feel we're on track. And listen, innovation is hard. There will be some bumps and twists and turns, but we're really, really confident that this is a product that the customers want to buy and that this is very viable, again, for us to operate in a way that enhances our business versus penalized.\nTony Bancroft: Thanks so much. Congratulations, Jon and team.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. When you look at your M&A bogey for this year and you say you have pretty good visibility in the pipeline for next year as well. What does the pipeline look like in terms of distribution across your businesses? And has that changed as you've engaged in conversations.\nJon Vander Ark: Well, if you go back from 5 years ago, it certainly has changed when we were predominantly vastly recycling and solid waste player, and we've obviously grown the Environmental Solutions business to Del's point, right, that's still about 10% of the business broadly. The pipeline is probably an 80-20 mix of 80% recycling and solid waste and 20% environmental solutions. So that will grow faster just because there's more geographies to fill in. There's a few product lines to build out. So there's more kind of inherent growth in that in terms of our starting point. But the balance of the business will still be recycling and solid waste and feel really confident about that. In any given time period, that could ship a single deal could flip it to 80-20 in any given quarter. But if you look across a longer time horizon of 3 to 5 years, I think that 80-20 makes us a pretty good barometer.\nTobey Sommer: Right. Thank you. Year-to-date, if you look at your employee base, what has the trend been like in not just employee turnover or perhaps improved turnover and attrition rates, but also the heavy lift that it is to recruit and hire new ads and train them. Are both of those sides of the equation getting easier?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Turnover is down. Employee engagement is up from a very high watermark. So people are engaged, right, turnover is down, and this is the recruiting situation in the last 4 to 5 months has substantially improved, number of applicants per open rec, right has substantially improved. So there's still pockets of tightness around so it could be very geographically dependent. But from a broad-based macro level as the situation versus 6 months ago is substantially better.\nTobey Sommer: Is there room for continued improvement, or are we already at healthy metrics if you make a longer-term comparison more than just sort of the Great Recession in 6 month ago period.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We talked about turnover being below 2019 levels. We aspire to continue to grind that down kind of 30 to 50 basis points of product turnover long-term would be great for us. Turnover is never going to be zero people move and have changes in life circumstances, and there's always opportunity bringing new talent, but we'll look to bring that down. But we feel like right now, we're at a very healthy level and that we can continue to improve from here.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk about the performance in the quarter. So your margins were up about 2 points sequentially 1Q versus 4Q, which is a good bit better-than-normal seasonality? Is it possible to parse how much of that was price cost and the municipal solid waste part of the business. You mentioned the ESPs. I wonder if you could just flush out the rest of that bridge in terms of that performance versus normal seasonality?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Jerry, we mentioned sequentially the Environmental Solutions business improving 350 basis points. But also in the fourth quarter, remember, as we outperformed the year, we had heavier incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter. So I would say there were some things that were more unique in Q4 as far as expenses are concerned off to a strong start this year. I think that's why you're seeing more of that sequential improvement. This year, we would expect just more normal seasonality and a Q4 that looks like what you've seen in the or 3 to 4 years as compared to what you saw last year from a margin perspective.\nJerry Revich: Super helpful. And then can I ask you, it feels like cost are stabilizing. Should we look for the price/cost gap sequentially to improve in the second quarter as a result of that dynamic?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. When we think about some of the cost inflation, we see some of the anniversarying, which is just a little bit more of when we saw some of those cost increase going into play last year. So yes, we start to anniversary some of those things in the second quarter. We started seeing a lot of that more on the wage side. We also start to see some of that modulate from a comp perspective on transportation costs beginning in the third and fourth quarter. So we would expect the inflation levels to decrease as we move sequentially. Again, it's not that we're seeing a significant price decrease in the current period. It's just that we're anniversarying the cost increase that went in the prior year.\nJerry Revich: Got it. And lastly, can I trouble share with us the incremental tailwinds to your business from the plastics and landfill gas investments that are scheduled to come online for '24 versus '23 and '25 versus '24. When do we get the most significant step up relative to the cadence?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. So if you think about -- let me start with the plastic side on the polymer center. We start to see that in '24, start to layer in with, call it, $15 million or so of EBITDA, and then it really ramp up into 25 and into 26 and until you get to a run rate of, call it, somewhere in that $75 million plus type EBITDA range. When you take a look at from a gas perspective, again, most of that, you're starting to see, again, you start to see the first projects come online towards the end of '23. So most of the contribution coming in '24, you could see $25 million plus type of incremental EBITDA in '24 and then sequentially in a $15 million to $20 million per year until we get to that $100 million worth of total contribution by 2028.\nJerry Revich: Super appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on Environmental Services, obviously, a good showing in Q1 here. You continue to make good progress. I get the sense earlier on when you acquired US Ecology, there was a fear that this business was more cyclical. Just wondering, as you cross-sell more and as you kind of pull this under the RSG umbrella, do you think it changes the cyclicality of that business? Like does the customer look at that service differently if they're also buying other RSG services? I know it's early days, but just wondering how that experience has been, just given the broader economy has been shaky here.\nJon Vander Ark: I think two things are true. When you're just predominantly a post-collections player, everything you see can look variable and cyclical because it could be a recurring revenue stream, but that provider might farm that out or source that out to a few different places looking for price. When you get closer to the generator, then you do you have control of that product. Now could they take that somewhere else, of course, they could over time. But when you provide excellent service and you have an integrated offering, you become stickier. And so huge opportunity that we're seeing right now to take things that might have looked more cyclical or volatile or variable to become more consistent and recurring in the revenue stream. That doesn't mean that will be 100% of it like we have in our current business. We have some of that base work. On the landfill side, we'll certainly have some of that. But over time, the profile will migrate closer to the recycling solid waste side.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. That's helpful. I apologize if this is somewhere in your release, but if I look at your organic growth composition, let's call it 80-20 split between yield and volume or price and volume. What would that look like today in your Environmental Services business, if I deconstruct the organic growth between volume and price. I apologize if I missed this earlier.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, I would probably say, it's probably relatively similar just from the perspective of some of these are project-related jobs. That being said, we've seen really good pricing in that business, but we've also just seen an increase of activity at the same time, which is really a function of now offering the most complete set of products and services in the space. So again, we're seeing a combination of both, and that's what's really driving the outsized revenue growth in that portion of the business.\nKevin Chiang: Thanks. Congrats on a great start to the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Feniger: Hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Brian, the growth on the ES side and now layering in the incremental EBITDA from plastic recycling and the landfill DAS in '24 and beyond. Does that change how we should be thinking about the free cash flow conversion and the improvement you guys are seeing there and potentially going forward?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Well, look, I mean, we said that rewind the clock 2, 3 years ago, and we were up high 30% free cash flow conversion company. We've moved that into the mid-40s, and we said we have line of sight into the high 40% and beyond. And we're working on these things. And again, those are some of the things that we're going to do in order to achieve that level of performance even while we're overcoming some headwinds to getting into that high 40% interest expense is a headwind to free cash flow conversion, the expiration of bonus depreciation, which is phasing out over the next 5 years. Those are all headwinds. And even in the face of those things, we think we can achieve that level of performance. And everything you just mentioned is the way we're going to get there.\nMike Feniger: Great. And I realize the regional banking crisis tightening lending standards is likely not an issue for you and your customers. Do you hear of any issues for some of your smaller regional competitors, ability to finance and buy new trucks, trying to expand. Just curious how the changed competitive dynamic or even some of the M&A opportunity going forward?\nJon Vander Ark: And I don't think we've seen that show up specifically. There's probably an example somewhere in our M&A pipeline. Of that being the case, I do think it's becoming more challenging, right? Because given supply chain challenges, because we got 90% of our trucks. If you were a spot buyer of trucks, you're in a really tough spot. You're going to be driving that truck, not as a matter of months, but a matter of years before you can get allocation on that. So digital, we've talked about that a number of times. That being the second moat in the business and our investments in that space and the ability to service customers and connect it to our operations and core systems, I think those are all things that make an attractive time for smaller players to sell.\nMike Feniger: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Michael E. Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, JVA. Hey, Del. Thanks. On the ES business, there's a bunch of pieces here. One, can you help fill in the gaps on what contributed to the 350 basis points sequentially. And then the idea of margin improving. I just want to make sure I understand mix. I mean, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I thought about third of this was fixed asset disposals, so high margin and 2/3rds is sort of billable hour services that are good returns but lower margin. I'm trying to figure out where that mix goes in order to achieve the target that was suggested earlier in the call.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, Michael, first of all, I think that it's a little bit more, I would sit there and say in the 50-50 rather than the 30-70 between those two aspects of the business. I think you have a combination of things. First, let's talk about what happened sequentially. So we talked about price increases that we put in late in '22 as well as early '23. So a certain aspect of that was certainly timing. Also, as you just think about increasing utilization as we're actually achieving the cross-sell, some of that is that we're utilizing some excess capacity that's in that system. So it's the flow-through of that incremental revenue is at a very high margin. We're seeing the combination of the both. So Jon mentioned it when we were on the call, some of the way that we're going to get there is also just by scale. When you take a look at the size of our areas, when you take a look at our four areas, they're managing less revenue than their counterparts on the recycling and solid waste space, which gives us capacity to grow into that and leverage that SG&A. So we built that area structure to look a lot like the recycling and solid waste side, even though they're managing less revenue, which gives them opportunity to grow without adding any additional SG&A costs.\nJon Vander Ark: And Michael, on the field services side of the business, but some of that would be getting MSAs with large industrial customers who we know are going to have a set of projects throughout the year. They're going to be in different spots. But if you look over a 10-year period, you've got a relatively consistent demand profile of their level of project spend, cleanup, plant turnarounds, et cetera, when you have the MSA and the relationship, that revenue stream then starts to look very recurring versus it's just an event or a job.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And that's always been the secret challenge or challenge for the billable hours world as they struggle with utilization of their billable hour resource. So what I'm hearing you say is you're striking a balance on how to maximize that.\nJon Vander Ark: Correct.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. On the price cadence for the remainder of the year to get to the 55. Can you help us with the mix between open and restricted through the remainder of the year, so we sort of understand how to think about that, that gets us to the total of 5.5 million for the year?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. We expect sequential increase into Q2 on the restricted portion of the book, and that kind of hit high watermark, and then it will decrease sequentially. Our expectation is it will decrease sequentially into Q3 and Q4. We think the high watermark on the open market is here in Q1, and it decreases sequentially but modestly. So again, I would sit there and as we talked about earlier, I guess, 60 days ago at this point that the spread between the high and the low by quarter is not that significant. Call it, 50, 60 basis points, plus or minus, from the midpoint, and that's what we would expect for the full year.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And just to be clear, so I got these some of your numbers coming at us, high watermark for the beginning of the year, sorry, I'm flipping pages. There's 11.7 in the open and 5.4 for restricted.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, that is correct. That's on core price, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: That's core. Not yield. What was the yields?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Correct. Well, the yield in total, we don't break the yield up between the two. Yields in total with 7.4% on related revenue. On total revenue, it was 6.5%. And again, if you're building it into a most -- go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: No, no, go ahead, please. That's what I was going to ask.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: I was going to say the reason we do, we break the two out that if you're building it on a model and you're using the base, the entire base period revenue probably have to use the total revenue number. Again, we disclosed the related revenue because we don't calculate price on all components of revenue. So again, if you want to get the true effectiveness of our pricing programs, that's why related revenue is applicable.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then, Jon, you made a comment earlier to an answer to your question, said 6%, and I missed, is that 6% inflation or you thought yield would maybe land at 6% by the end of the year?\nJon Vander Ark: No. We said cost inflation, we think, throughout the year, end up around 6%, [indiscernible] going into the year, 5.5%. So we're seeing a little elevation there, primarily here in the first and the second quarter. But again, we're pricing ahead of our expectations as well. So we're getting the performance that we expected, just a little bit different path to get there.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. Which would suggest the guide of 5.5% probably works its way up to staying on top of that.\nJon Vander Ark: We'll update you in July.\nMichael Hoffman: Had to try. See you in Orleans on the weekend. Thanks.\nOperator: At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Vaishnavi. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their commitment to deliver an essential service in the markets we serve. Our results are a direct reflection of the team's ongoing efforts to deliver best-in-class service to all our customers. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the year strong and are pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance reflects our ability to grow across our business while enhancing profitability. We remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace by providing the most complete set of products and services to customers. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, including 11% from acquisitions, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and produced $496 million of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. We invested $224 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. All transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of outsized levels of activity in both recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for well over $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2023. We are making great progress on the integration of U.S. Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. We continue to adjust prices to earn an appropriate return on the valuable services we provide. The acceptance of our pricing actions remains high with very little customer defection. Cross-selling our complete set of products and services continues to run ahead of plan with more than $60 million in new sales to date. We have now achieved over $40 million of annualized cost savings. As a result of the actions taken in the Environmental Solutions business, EBITDA margin improved to just over 20% during the first quarter. We continue to generate outsized growth by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding customers' yield. We remain laser-focused on providing a world-class customer experience to drive increased loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained at 94%. We continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Our front-end colleagues, including drivers, technicians and the customer experience team are determined to fulfill our daily commitments to our customers. We delivered robust organic revenue growth during the quarter and simultaneously increased in both price and volume. For price and related revenue increased to 9.3% and average yield on related revenue increased to 7.4%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 1.8%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Turning to digital, we continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. Over 75% of our residential routes are operating with RISE tablets. The remaining routes are on-track to be completed by mid-year. This technology is the foundation that will allow us to further enhance our digital service offerings and improve our customer experience. Moving on to sustainability. We are investing in differentiated capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. In February, we announced our plans to significantly scale our electric fleet through our long-term agreement with Oshkosh. We will begin operating 2 fully integrated electric recycling and solid waste collection prototypes later this year and expect to start buying a scale in 2025. This announcement supports our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification through a multi-supplier strategy. Development of our Palmer centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on-track with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024 respectively. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect at least six of these projects to commence operations this year. Our approach to sustainability includes our aspiration to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve, and we are seeing positive results. Turnover rates continue to improve, and we are now below 2019 levels. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. We continue to be widely recognized for our comprehensive sustainability performance. For example, we were recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies list and Fortune's list of the world's Most Admired Companies. A positive momentum in our business continues to build as we harness the power of our differentiated capabilities. We will continue to invest for the future profitable growth to deliver the results that create unmistakable value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide financial details for the quarter. Yes, certainly a very strong environment still. We expect kind of maintain that momentum for the first half and for lots of reasons, we think that sequentially comes down into the second half, right, as some inflation starts to modulate and in our restricted portion of our business, obviously, right, CPI comes down in terms of where the comps go, but we also expect cost inflation to modulate through the year. So we think we'll have pretty good price margin spread throughout the year, which will lead to a positive result for the year. Yes, a really strong quarter for us, obviously, right, over 20% and broad-based, and a portion of that is certainly the cross-sell opportunities that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And that we're offering customers a comprehensive and integrated offering and part of that is showing up in our recycling and solid waste business and going to our special waste into our landfill. And that's the benefit of our offering where we can take things into liquid hazardous waste, we can take solid hazardous waste, we can take special way so we can provide a range of solutions to customers, and that still put us in a pretty differentiated position in the marketplace and excited about the momentum that the team has. Yes, we feel we're certainly -- feel good about the guidance at this point. Yes, start where you ended. It's certainly starting higher and modulating throughout the course of the year. I think it's going to be a little higher than the 5.5%, probably closer to 6% would be our best look at this point right now and a few different factors on that. Certainly, truck delivery would be one where we got about 90% of our trucks last year, and we think we're going to get probably that 10% from last year and about 90% of this year, and we're growing. So that means we're buying some older trucks. Operating some older trucks to service those growth opportunities, and they have a higher cost per engine hour. And so that's elevated maintenance costs. It's higher cost, not necessarily unit cost inflation on the part, for example, is just operating more expensive vehicles. And hopefully, in 2024, the suppliers catch up, but we can kind of get back on track. So that would be one example why it's just a little bit higher than we predicted. Yes. Listen, I think pricing is certainly going to be a huge lever in terms of how we get there and the primary lever. I think a little bit of scale benefit, obviously, which allows us to leverage our overhead. We've built this thing for growth. So as we continue to grow, we get some leverage on our overhead spend in that space as well. And just additional integration opportunities across recycling and solid waste business. We haven't really taken advantage of all of those things yet. And then, the last thing will be just cost management. Cost discipline and making sure that we are pricing work appropriately in understanding the cost position of all that work so that all of our individual opportunities and projects are profitable. We've made great progress on that, but there's more room in front of us. And this was the investment thesis when we did the deal, obvious. So we did it based on Intrinsic and $40 million of cost synergies we've just gotten there quicker than we expected. We've gotten the 40 rate. I think we're going to end up closer to 50, when we're said and done. And then, we thought there was upward pressure on pricing. We thought there was cross-sell opportunities. And we said we'd get $75 million to $100 million over 3 years. We've already gotten 60, which tells you with a good pipeline, which tells you that we're going to get to that 75 to 100 quicker than we expected. And we know that when we price, so we anticipate there will be some customer fallout churn, but the net dollars work over time. We've just seen very, very little churn, which speaks to the fact that this is a valuable offering. It's a very small portion of the vast majority of our customers' cost structure and that we're going to continue to price for the value we deliver. Yes. Let me put a caveat on first, which is we remain humble and dynamic, right? The last 3 years have bought a lot of people that there's fundamental uncertainty in the market and I read the same things you do, which is people have been talking about a recession, you're announced for 12 to 18 months. So we have our eyes and ears open and that will be nimble should that occur. All that being said, we see a lot of positive signs. We're seeing strong growth and pricing. Let me give you a number or a perspective. In our open market, we're sending out more -- a higher gross price increase than we ever had before. and our realization rate, which is the percentage of that pricing that sticks. Customers don't call back to negotiate, et cetera, is the highest it's ever been, which is somewhat of an astounding number to think about, they were putting a lot of price. That price is sticking in the marketplace for growing. We talked about special waste in that pipeline being strong. We're starting to see a commodity rebound, which we put a modest rebound in our plan, and I think we feel really good that the outlook there looks strong on that front. We've seen a little decline in temp units year-over-year. We anticipated that in our plan with where residential and commercial construction were going at the end of last year, but our yield number is very, very strong there. So we're doing some of that to ourselves in terms of yielding on those assets. So we're pretty confident in the very near term and cautiously optimistic around the demand environment for the remainder of the year. And then the specific to derailment in Ohio, I think is the one you're referring to, a de minimis impact in the quarter. Very strong, very broad-based. Listen, we've gone out with multiple double-digit price increases, which is sticking. Obviously, that business is more unique, and there's a lot of mix elements because you're doing a lot of individual project work and a lot of things like special waste on the hazard side that come in. So we haven't yet developed our yield metric, which we aspire to do over time in that portion of the business. And I'd say the industrial economy from our seat in the park is still very strong. Now it's not universally strong on boarded, for example, would be a spot that's a little bit down. So we're seeing some of that in the Midwest, which has a lot of manufacturing capacity there, but other parts are very, very strong on the industrial side. Yes, I think you got moving pieces there. Obviously, when the economy goes down, people will get cautious and things that have discretion to them, you're going to see some delays. But the vast majority of our special waste those are jobs that need to get completed. They need to get done. So it's not a matter of the job getting canceled. It's a matter of the job getting pushed. And I'd say the counterbalance of that right now is just all of the infrastructure spending and government funding. We see a lot of those opportunities just starting to emerge, but we really haven't taken advantage of a lot of that spending hasn't flowed all the way through to jobs being committed here. Operator, why don't we move on to the next question. Yes. We feel really good about the start to the business and said what remains quiet positive as you know, it's a seasonal business, so you get a ramp-up here in Q2 and Q3. And we want to see that ramp-up fully take hold. We are starting certainly see some of that ready but that gets into full swing here in May and the summer month in the northern part of the country. And so we'll come back in July when we talk again and see our progress there, and we'll tell you if we have any update at that point. So yes, we put out in our initial guidance. We anticipated spending $500 million. I think we'll exceed that number as we go throughout the year. We have a really attractive pipeline, both in recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions. And so I think you'll see some of those deals come across through the remainder of the year, and we get things are at different stages. We're all the way in the front end of conversations to the back end of letters of intent, and we report on things once we sign and close those deals. So you'll hear more in the second quarter. And the exact timing of where that flows between Q2, Q3 and Q4, obviously, we don't predict that because things can people forward or they can move out a few months here or there. The pipeline remains strong. I think both for '23 and all the way into '24 at this point. We feel really good about the pipeline. Yes. Look, we remain committed to pricing ahead of our cost inflation to allow us to expand margins across the business. So we've talked about 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion that's kind of the pace that we go after, and that would be our initial ingoing assumption in 2024. Now a lot can change between now and then in terms of could we get more than that, if we can do that and maintain and improve the health of our overall business, we'll certainly do that, but more to come down the road here on 2024 perspective. Yes. Very important regulation. And again, we're not opposed to regulation, we happen if it's well constructed, so we have a seat at that table. And we're involved in those conversations to make sure that we don't, as a company, or even an industry get penalized for something that we catch. We didn't create the problem. People should be happy that we've got the modern infrastructure and systems to protect the environment. Net-net, we see it as more of an opportunity over time, especially with our Environmental Solutions business and being able to serve customers. Could that have some elevated costs in our landfill, Yes, we've got a really good history of passing those types of costs, regulatory costs. on to customers. And so more to come on that as we move forward. But we're very much in the conversation and we'll be active in shaping the legislation in a way that it enhances the business versus penalizes the business. Still very much on track. We've got more than 20 trucks right around the country right now that are electrified through multiple manufacturers. We talked about our Oshkosh partnership and that the first kind of bottoms up zero emission designed vehicle and excited about that. And that number of 20 will go north of 50 next year, by 2025, we'll have several hundred vehicles. And it is important. It's not just the vehicle, it's the system. So you need to have the infrastructure, you need to have understanding government regulations, you need to understand the incentives, and we've been working for years on those things and have multiple infrastructure projects already going on, anticipating where we're going to put vehicles in working closely with customers. So we feel we're on track. And listen, innovation is hard. There will be some bumps and twists and turns, but we're really, really confident that this is a product that the customers want to buy and that this is very viable, again, for us to operate in a way that enhances our business versus penalized. Well, if you go back from 5 years ago, it certainly has changed when we were predominantly vastly recycling and solid waste player, and we've obviously grown the Environmental Solutions business to Del's point, right, that's still about 10% of the business broadly. The pipeline is probably an 80-20 mix of 80% recycling and solid waste and 20% environmental solutions. So that will grow faster just because there's more geographies to fill in. There's a few product lines to build out. So there's more kind of inherent growth in that in terms of our starting point. But the balance of the business will still be recycling and solid waste and feel really confident about that. In any given time period, that could ship a single deal could flip it to 80-20 in any given quarter. But if you look across a longer time horizon of 3 to 5 years, I think that 80-20 makes us a pretty good barometer. Yes. Turnover is down. Employee engagement is up from a very high watermark. So people are engaged, right, turnover is down, and this is the recruiting situation in the last 4 to 5 months has substantially improved, number of applicants per open rec, right has substantially improved. So there's still pockets of tightness around so it could be very geographically dependent. But from a broad-based macro level as the situation versus 6 months ago is substantially better. Yes. We talked about turnover being below 2019 levels. We aspire to continue to grind that down kind of 30 to 50 basis points of product turnover long-term would be great for us. Turnover is never going to be zero people move and have changes in life circumstances, and there's always opportunity bringing new talent, but we'll look to bring that down. But we feel like right now, we're at a very healthy level and that we can continue to improve from here. I think two things are true. When you're just predominantly a post-collections player, everything you see can look variable and cyclical because it could be a recurring revenue stream, but that provider might farm that out or source that out to a few different places looking for price. When you get closer to the generator, then you do you have control of that product. Now could they take that somewhere else, of course, they could over time. But when you provide excellent service and you have an integrated offering, you become stickier. And so huge opportunity that we're seeing right now to take things that might have looked more cyclical or volatile or variable to become more consistent and recurring in the revenue stream. That doesn't mean that will be 100% of it like we have in our current business. We have some of that base work. On the landfill side, we'll certainly have some of that. But over time, the profile will migrate closer to the recycling solid waste side. And I don't think we've seen that show up specifically. There's probably an example somewhere in our M&A pipeline. Of that being the case, I do think it's becoming more challenging, right? Because given supply chain challenges, because we got 90% of our trucks. If you were a spot buyer of trucks, you're in a really tough spot. You're going to be driving that truck, not as a matter of months, but a matter of years before you can get allocation on that. So digital, we've talked about that a number of times. That being the second moat in the business and our investments in that space and the ability to service customers and connect it to our operations and core systems, I think those are all things that make an attractive time for smaller players to sell. And Michael, on the field services side of the business, but some of that would be getting MSAs with large industrial customers who we know are going to have a set of projects throughout the year. They're going to be in different spots. But if you look over a 10-year period, you've got a relatively consistent demand profile of their level of project spend, cleanup, plant turnarounds, et cetera, when you have the MSA and the relationship, that revenue stream then starts to look very recurring versus it's just an event or a job. Correct. No. We said cost inflation, we think, throughout the year, end up around 6%, [indiscernible] going into the year, 5.5%. So we're seeing a little elevation there, primarily here in the first and the second quarter. But again, we're pricing ahead of our expectations as well. So we're getting the performance that we expected, just a little bit different path to get there. We'll update you in July. Thank you, Vaishnavi. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their commitment to deliver an essential service in the markets we serve. Our results are a direct reflection of the team's ongoing efforts to deliver best-in-class service to all our customers. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "name": "Brian DelGhiaccio",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 8.2%. Core price on related revenue was 9.3%, which included open market pricing of 11.7% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.6%, large container of 9.6% and residential of 8.4%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.5%. Average yield on related revenue was 7.4%, an increase of 70 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 1.6%, while volume on related revenue increased 1.8%. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.6%. an increase in large container of 80 basis points and an increase in landfill of 8.6%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 21.7% increase in special waste revenue. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $105 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $201 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 90 basis points during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe that commodity prices will continue to recover in the second half of the year as the global supply/demand imbalance continues to correct. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $309 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 20.6%, a sequential increase of 350 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 29%. This compares to 30.4% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which includes 90 basis points related to US Ecology, 60 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from an additional work day, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 40 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow was $496 million in the first quarter or approximately 25% of the midpoint of our full year guidance. Free cash flow conversion was 47.6%. Total debt was $12.1 billion, and total liquidity was $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.1x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.3% during the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. With that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Yes. And also what I would add to that is that our pipeline for special waste opportunities remains very strong. And about 20% of that pipeline is a direct result of cross-sell opportunities. Yes. Let me address the MSW. So MSW volume was up 1.2%. I think more importantly, though, MSW yield was up 5.6%. So very strong pricing in that portion of our business. Yes. Walter, I would say the first thing to keep in perspective is that Environmental Solutions revenue in total is about 10% of our book. You got to keep that in mind. That being said, a good portion of this revenue stream is, as a consistent and recurring nature to it. And increasingly more, we're trying to get closer to the customer to make that more of an annuity type revenue stream. Is it exactly the same? Maybe not, but is it pretty close, I would say yes. Yes. From a commodity perspective, we're tracking almost exactly the way that we thought we would. So we thought we would start the year right around this, call it, $100 a ton, sequentially increasing with a full year average of about $125 per ton. And so right now, we would say with what we saw in the first quarter on average plus where current prices are at $115 per ton. It's playing out exactly the way we thought it would. And so when you think about the margin cadence of that, in this quarter, it was a 60 basis point headwind. We think it's a relatively consistent headwind in Q2. That drops to, call it, a 20 basis point headwind in Q3 and then flip positive in Q4 at those levels. Certainly in part. That's why you're going to see it. When you actually sell into the recycling and solid waste business, what you're going to see is that's where a good portion of it is going to come in. That's a lot of the volume aspect of it. But at the same time, we're seeing that -- again, we're talking about total revenue being up about 22%. It's a pretty good split between both price and volume. So it's a combination of both, and that's going to be a reflection again of just healthy activity, which includes the benefits of that cross-sell. Yes. Jerry, we mentioned sequentially the Environmental Solutions business improving 350 basis points. But also in the fourth quarter, remember, as we outperformed the year, we had heavier incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter. So I would say there were some things that were more unique in Q4 as far as expenses are concerned off to a strong start this year. I think that's why you're seeing more of that sequential improvement. This year, we would expect just more normal seasonality and a Q4 that looks like what you've seen in the or 3 to 4 years as compared to what you saw last year from a margin perspective. Yes. When we think about some of the cost inflation, we see some of the anniversarying, which is just a little bit more of when we saw some of those cost increase going into play last year. So yes, we start to anniversary some of those things in the second quarter. We started seeing a lot of that more on the wage side. We also start to see some of that modulate from a comp perspective on transportation costs beginning in the third and fourth quarter. So we would expect the inflation levels to decrease as we move sequentially. Again, it's not that we're seeing a significant price decrease in the current period. It's just that we're anniversarying the cost increase that went in the prior year. Yes. So if you think about -- let me start with the plastic side on the polymer center. We start to see that in '24, start to layer in with, call it, $15 million or so of EBITDA, and then it really ramp up into 25 and into 26 and until you get to a run rate of, call it, somewhere in that $75 million plus type EBITDA range. When you take a look at from a gas perspective, again, most of that, you're starting to see, again, you start to see the first projects come online towards the end of '23. So most of the contribution coming in '24, you could see $25 million plus type of incremental EBITDA in '24 and then sequentially in a $15 million to $20 million per year until we get to that $100 million worth of total contribution by 2028. Yes, I would probably say, it's probably relatively similar just from the perspective of some of these are project-related jobs. That being said, we've seen really good pricing in that business, but we've also just seen an increase of activity at the same time, which is really a function of now offering the most complete set of products and services in the space. So again, we're seeing a combination of both, and that's what's really driving the outsized revenue growth in that portion of the business. Well, look, I mean, we said that rewind the clock 2, 3 years ago, and we were up high 30% free cash flow conversion company. We've moved that into the mid-40s, and we said we have line of sight into the high 40% and beyond. And we're working on these things. And again, those are some of the things that we're going to do in order to achieve that level of performance even while we're overcoming some headwinds to getting into that high 40% interest expense is a headwind to free cash flow conversion, the expiration of bonus depreciation, which is phasing out over the next 5 years. Those are all headwinds. And even in the face of those things, we think we can achieve that level of performance. And everything you just mentioned is the way we're going to get there. Yes, Michael, first of all, I think that it's a little bit more, I would sit there and say in the 50-50 rather than the 30-70 between those two aspects of the business. I think you have a combination of things. First, let's talk about what happened sequentially. So we talked about price increases that we put in late in '22 as well as early '23. So a certain aspect of that was certainly timing. Also, as you just think about increasing utilization as we're actually achieving the cross-sell, some of that is that we're utilizing some excess capacity that's in that system. So it's the flow-through of that incremental revenue is at a very high margin. We're seeing the combination of the both. So Jon mentioned it when we were on the call, some of the way that we're going to get there is also just by scale. When you take a look at the size of our areas, when you take a look at our four areas, they're managing less revenue than their counterparts on the recycling and solid waste space, which gives us capacity to grow into that and leverage that SG&A. So we built that area structure to look a lot like the recycling and solid waste side, even though they're managing less revenue, which gives them opportunity to grow without adding any additional SG&A costs. Yes. We expect sequential increase into Q2 on the restricted portion of the book, and that kind of hit high watermark, and then it will decrease sequentially. Our expectation is it will decrease sequentially into Q3 and Q4. We think the high watermark on the open market is here in Q1, and it decreases sequentially but modestly. So again, I would sit there and as we talked about earlier, I guess, 60 days ago at this point that the spread between the high and the low by quarter is not that significant. Call it, 50, 60 basis points, plus or minus, from the midpoint, and that's what we would expect for the full year. Yes, that is correct. That's on core price, Michael. Correct. Well, the yield in total, we don't break the yield up between the two. Yields in total with 7.4% on related revenue. On total revenue, it was 6.5%. And again, if you're building it into a most -- go ahead. I was going to say the reason we do, we break the two out that if you're building it on a model and you're using the base, the entire base period revenue probably have to use the total revenue number. Again, we disclosed the related revenue because we don't calculate price on all components of revenue. So again, if you want to get the true effectiveness of our pricing programs, that's why related revenue is applicable."

Regarding customer zeal, our focus on delivering world-class essential services continues to support organic growth and enhance customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at more than 94%. Third quarter organic revenue growth was driven by strong pricing across the business. Average yield on total revenue was 4.6%, and average yield on related revenue was 5.5%. This level of pricing continued to exceed our cost inflation and help drive 210 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on total revenue declined 1.2%. Volume losses were heavily concentrated to the cyclical portions of our business, including special waste and construction activity. Turning to our expanding digital capabilities. We continue to advance the implementation of digital tools to improve the experience for both customers and employees. Deployment of MPower, our new fleet and equipment management system is underway. MPower is designed to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhance warranty recovery. Deployment of the new system is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2025. We estimate MPower will deliver $20 million annual cost savings once fully implemented. We continue to benefit from innovative technology on our recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and recycling contamination. This technology generated more than $60 million in incremental revenue in the first year of operation. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewal natural gas position us to continue grow and create long-term value creation. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities continues to move forward. Las Vegas Polymer Center production volumes continued to increase throughout the quarter. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with initial equipment commissioning underway. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. We expect construction on this facility to be complete by the year of this year, with earnings contribution in the second half of 2025. We recently broke ground on a Blue Polymers production facility in Buckeye, Arizona, this facility will complement the Las Vegas Polymer Center. We expect the completion of this facility in late 2025. We continue to bring decarbonization solutions to the market that will unlock value for all of our stakeholders including the communities we serve. The renewable natural gas projects we're developing with our partners continue to advance. Two projects came online during the third quarter, bringing the total completed this year to four projects. We expect four additional RNG projects to be completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to advance our commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 28 electric collection vehicles in operation and expect to have more than 50 EVs in our fleet by the end of the year. We have 18 facilities with commercial scale EV charging infrastructure. As part of our approach to sustainability, we are committed to being an employer of choice in the markets we serve. Our third quarter employee turnover rate improved more than 100 basis points compared to the prior year and we are proud to be certified as a great place to work for the eighth consecutive year. With respect to capital allocation, year-to-date, we have invested $104 million in strategic acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We currently have more than $200 million of transactions that are expected to close by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we returned $834 million to shareholders, which includes $330 million of share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 6.2%, core price on related revenue was 7.4%, which included open market pricing of 9.1% and restricted pricing of 4.8%. The components of core price on related revenue included: small container of 10.3%, large container of 6.9% and residential of 7.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 4.6%, and average yield on related revenue was 5.5%. As expected, average yields stepped down sequentially as we began to anniversary the impact of new fees implemented last year. The fees relate to overfilled containers and recycling contamination and were enabled by our digital platform. Third quarter volume on total revenue decreased 1.2% and volume on related revenue decreased 1.5%. Volume results included a decrease in large container of 3.6%, primarily due to continued softness in construction-related activities a decrease in residential of 2.9%, primarily due to municipal contracts lost in 2023 then anniversary in the fourth quarter of this year. During the quarter, small center volume decreased 40 basis points, while landfill MSW increased 30 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $177 per ton during the third quarter. This compares to $112 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 70 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are currently $106 per ton reflecting a recent decline in the price for recovered cardboard, or OCC. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 210 basis points to 32%. Margin performance during the quarter: margin expansion in the underlying business of 120 basis points, a 40 basis point increase from net fuel, a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 50 basis point benefit from an insurance recovery related to a prior year claim. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions completed in the prior year. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $60 million compared to the prior year, driven by the rollover contribution from prior year acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business expanded 290 basis points to 25.5% in the third quarter. Environmental Solutions EBITDA margin was 22.6% and in the prior year. Environmental Solutions margin included a positive 110 basis points from an adjustment to an allowance for bad debt established in a prior year. Excluding this benefit, Environmental Solutions margin would have been 24.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures. Year to date net capital expenditures of $1.19 billion represents an increase of $250 million or 27% compared to the prior year. Capital spending is more ratable in 2024, whereas 2023 was heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Prior year capital expenditures were impacted by vendor-related delay in truck and equipment deliveries. Total debt $12.6 billion and total liquidity $2.6 billion. Our leverage rate at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.6 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 21.6% during the quarter. This favorable tax rate driven primarily by the timing of equity investments in renewable energy contributed $0.09 of EPS benefit during the quarter. I will now hand back over to Jon.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Brian. With respect to 2024, we believe we are trending toward the low end of our full year revenue guidance due to continued softness in cyclical volumes. That said, we expect to more than overcome this revenue headwind and achieved the high end of our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. As a result, we expect EBITDA margin to outperform our expectations. Looking forward to 2025, we expect continued growth across the business supported by pricing ahead of underlying costs, cross-selling our complete set of products and services and capitalizing on value-creating acquisition opportunities. We also expect financial contribution from the investments made in sustainability innovation, including plastic circularity and renewable natural gas projects. We believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow along with margin expansion in the underlying business. Over the long term, we believe our business can consistently deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and grow EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow faster than revenue. Our initial perspective on full year 2025 is consistent with this long-term growth algorithm. We plan to provide detailed 2025 guidance on our earnings call in February. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Nice quarter. Brian, I'm wondering if you could just expand if there are any other onetime type items in the quarter, really impressive performance. And as I look at the fourth quarter guidance, it looks like you're guiding to margins to step down a couple of points more than normal seasonality 4Q versus 3Q. I'm wondering is that just conservatism? Or were there any other embedded tailwinds in the third quarter beyond that debt item that you spoke about environmental services.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Thanks, Jerry. Taking a look at the third quarter, we called out the two big pieces that you would sit there and in say, we're somewhat large and unusual for the quarter. So the insurance recovery, which had an impact of a positive 50 basis points to the quarter itself. We called out the bad debt as well. So it was 110 basis points to Environmental Solutions, about 10 basis point contribution to the enterprise taken as a whole. So 60 basis points, we would say, ex that, the rest, I mean, I called out the theses about what fuel and commodity prices were doing, but the underlying business, you saw the strength of that 100 bps.\nJerry Revich: Really impressive performance. And then if I can shift gears, and ask you to talk about on the polymer center rollout, can you just expand on the performance so far? How has the production ramp played out versus the initial plan? And any updates to the time lines that you folks previously shared.\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yes. We're really happy in terms of the pricing we're getting. We're beating our pro forma math. Certainly happy on the volume ramp in terms of how that equipment is building. We got off to a little later start than we would have liked for things all unrelated to the equipment. So permitting of the facility, getting electricity in, just getting all the things around the construction on the building envelope. Those things take time. Maybe we were a little aggressive in our time line to begin with. [indiscernible] delayed from the start there, but the underlying assumptions other than a delayed start, we still feel very confident in. And India is hitting its marks, including the construction time line there. So we feel really good about that. Listen, we think we're producing some of the cleanest [lake] (ph) in the world. And so that's what the market needs. It's good for circularity and certainly going to be good for our shareholders as well.\nJerry Revich: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question today comes from Trevor Romeo with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Romeo: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Had one kind of on the -- on pricing, thinking about open market versus restricted. I think the last several quarters, your open market core price has been 400 basis points or more above restricted. Is that kind of a good spread for us to still think about going forward, even if some of the inflation indices kind of continue to ramp down. And then in your shift away from CPI to more of those open market and alternative entities, how much further room do you think you have to continue that shift at this point?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: When you take a look at the spread, and we certainly talked about the fact that we thought we were in an elevated pricing environment in part due to the fact that there was the backdrop of elevated inflation. And we've said that throughout this year, that would step down sequentially. And as we look forward into 2025, we would expect that to step down as well. Now, if you take a look back historically, open market pricing has tend to run above that which you can achieve on the restricted portion of the business. I would say right now that spread is probably a little bit more than what I would think about through the cycle. But all that said, we would expect to price in excess of our cost inflation consistent with what we've done over the last couple of years and drive margin expansion in the business.\nTrevor Romeo: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nJon Vander Ark: And then in terms of moving away from the [industries] (ph) or rotating away from CPI, we continue to maintain incremental progress on that. So couple of big contracts moving to water sewer trash, and it's really some moving to fixed and above them, it's really the portfolio that we think positions us well across the cycle.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, we're about 61% of those contracts that were historically pegged to headline CPI that have moved to something that we would consider favorable.\nTrevor Romeo: Got it. Okay. Thank you both. That's helpful. And then just quickly, wondering if we could talk about labor availability a bit. I think based on the BLS data, wage inflation in your industry is kind of mid-single digits. Curious if that's still what you're seeing as well. And then just kind of as the overall labor market has maybe cooled a bit the past few months? Have you seen any changes in labor availability?\nJon Vander Ark: We mentioned turnover down 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to trend in a really positive direction there. Labor cost inflation is 4.5-ish percent, we're hanging out right there. And again, that cake is largely baked because we start -- we give our people a wage increase at the end of February. On that front, we expect that to step down marginally as we move into next year based on where the current numbers are pointing. And then yes, labor availability is improving. There's still categories like technicians, which have been historically tough in this industry and that you're getting tougher. That's why we vertically integrated into technical education and sort of our own tech Institute and are growing our own and having a lot of success fielding entry-level techs out of that center.\nTrevor Romeo: Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. I was hoping to ask for some additional color on the core price deceleration this quarter? I know you mentioned the anniversarying of the new fees from last year. Obviously, that was expected. Anything else that you would point to in the quarter to call out that was notable in terms of the price environment and how we should be thinking about it as we progress through the year.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. If you take a look at the sequential step down from Q2 to Q4, I also point out that the restricted portion of our business went from 5.6% to 4.9%. And that's just on the price increase perspective. So again, that's just reflective of the indices themselves. And again, and as expected, right? We knew that it would step down sequentially, as I mentioned previously, so is our cost inflation. And as long as we can maintain that spread, that's how we drive margin expansion in the business.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And I did want to ask about volume as well. I know you mentioned the special waste and the construction softness. Should we continue to expect those trends to continue in the upcoming quarters? And anything else to call out on the volume side would be helpful. Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Look, I think across the industry in the last 12 to 18 months, we're in a flat to slightly negative demand environment from a unit standpoint. So it probably hasn't been talked about or well understood. On that front, and it's a cyclical portions driving that. It's also true a little bit in the industrial side of the business, it's where a large container permanent, right, we're gaining customers. So we're gaining share there, but we're seeing activity that has continued to be relatively soft at individual customers on that front. Look, on the construction side, whether this happens in three to six months or it happens in nine to 12 months, I'm optimistic on that side of the business for both commercial and residential. Interest rates coming down certainly helps with that. You've got both sides of the aisle talking about housing policy. We've underbuilt single-family homes in the United States in the last 15 years. And so, there's a lot of pent-up demand on that front. And then we're starting to see some really interesting signs here on special waste and the industrial activity, and there's always a little bit of paralysis in an election year, and we're starting to see a pipeline that's been actually quite strong all year, but jobs haven't moved and those jobs are starting to move here in the fourth quarter. So we're pretty optimistic for the remainder of the year and certainly into 2025.\nToni Kaplan: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Kevin Chang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon and congrats on some good results. I think on the Q2 call, you mentioned just on M&A here. You had mentioned, I think, about a $300 million pipeline that are in advanced stages. It looks like you booked about $200 million in Q3 here. Just wondering as we think of that incremental $100 million, is that something you think you can close by year-end. Or is there an update to that pipeline as you kind of work through that pipeline?\nJon Vander Ark: Maybe broader backdrop, coming off three really great years of M&A. Our commitment to M&A has certainly not dwindled and our outlook and our optimism going forward hasn't changed. There's always some ebb and flow. So we closed a couple of really big deals in Q4 last year, first half got off to a little bit of a slower start this year. I think if you put together what we've already done this year and what we expect to close in the fourth quarter, we're more like $300 million where we gave you an indicator of closer to $500 million at the start of the year. A lot of those deals are starting to build here, and so I expect us to have a really good first half next year on that front. So that gives you a sense of kind of the movement on that front. But our -- our outlook and our enthusiasm for M&A remains strong, and we expect that to be a meaningful contributor next year.\nKevin Chiang: No, that's helpful. And just my second one here, I think about a month ago, you put place an order for about 100 EVs. And I think you're targeting, I think, half of new purchases in 2028 will be electric vehicle -- electric vehicles. I guess when we hear other commercial fleet operators, there seems to be a growing pushback on, I guess, adopting this technology, whether the arguments of technology is not ready yet or infrastructure is not ready. Just as you think of your EV strategy in that 2028 time line, just I guess how you see the OEMs their ability to keep pace, I guess, with the targets you have, I guess, just looking out kind of four years from now?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, definitely there will be people that move faster and people that move slower. I mean we've learned from all kinds of experience that EV isn't just a truck, it's a system, so you need to understand how to put in the infrastructure and get after that early. You need to understand the incentive environment on that front because that certainly accelerates adoption and shortens the payback period, and we've had teams working on that for three years. And given the unlock is somebody building a truly studs up EV vehicle. No one's ever done that in our space before until Oshkosh for their McNeils vehicle. And that's a game changer because that allows you to get enough battery power on the vehicle that you can run a full day without sacrificing payload. And that was always the design parameter we had, which is we're not going to sacrifice productivity to do that. So we're thrilled with the product that we are running. I think there'll be other OEMs. Hopefully, they get there. This [indiscernible] sense people to move, but there's certainly going to be winners and losers in the short to medium term in terms of pace of adoption.\nKevin Chiang: Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Konark Gupta with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.\nKonark Gupta: Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to catch up on the housekeeping items first on the M&A side. Do you talk about the rollover effect in 2025 based on what you have closed today?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: The rollover impact. Yes. So we would expect right now to see relatively negligible to 2025 growth. It's 10 to 20 basis points at this point.\nKonark Gupta: Okay. And obviously, there's probably upside if you are out to close some of the acquisitions you're talking about in Q4, maybe then.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: That is correct. Because that only includes that, which is actually closed through the third quarter, there would be a rollover impact of anything that closes in the fourth quarter.\nKonark Gupta: Makes sense. Thank you. And then my question is on the margin side. So if I look at the trend this year so far, your margins have sequentially expanded and you talked to some of the kind of nuances on Q3 for sure. But then Q4, the margin kind of drops on an implied basis. Heading into 2025, I'm just thinking like what are some of the puts and takes you're thinking about margin as some of the circularity projects are ramping up, maybe and then some of these headwinds might fade away next year. What's the best sort of proxy for thinking about margin expansion next year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're certainly not giving 2025 guidance, but an outlook that we've talked about in the prepared remarks and we mentioned often to investors is that, we want to grow revenue mid-single digits and then grow EBITDA margin or EBITDA slightly faster than that, which implies EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow was slightly faster than that. And EBITDA margin across the cycle, kind of, I think, 30 to 50 basis points. Obviously, this year is going to be stronger than that, but we would certainly go into next year kind of in that ZIP code in terms of our expectations of how we're going to expand margin in the business.\nKonark Gupta: Okay. That\u2019s fair and great color. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from David Manthey with Barrett. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. It's less than three years since the Ecol acquisition and I believe you said that EBITDA in Environmental Solutions is about 24%. Going back to 2021, Ecol stand-alone targets were like $17 million and I think $40 million of synergies probably picks you up 300 basis points, 400 basis points. Is the delta there, the remainder? Is that just improved pricing? Or is there any kind of acquisition mix benefit in that improvement as well? Any help you can give us there?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, all above, it's in every lever. So starting out with -- on the revenue side, it's customer mix. So we're going through verticals and understanding willingness to pay and where we have pricing power and what the more profitable verticals are and less profitable verticals. So you've seen some customer churn in that space this year as we've certainly pushed price because our services are valuable and found lots of willingness to pay and a few people that want to experience lower quality for a period of time in that front. And then just the pricing of -- is the top pricing, very tactical account level pricing, kind of looking at every lever there still more upside, certainly there going forward as we put in the systems and technology to give our team members better tools on that front. And then good cost management, cost discipline, right, better labor utilization. As we get bigger, especially in the field services side of the business, you're able to deploy labor in different markets and therefore, get better utilization rates on that labor. So really proud of the team and the work we've done there. We said we thought we could get to 25% of the midterm target, and there's an ebb and flow across quarters, of course, but we've made faster progress than I think we originally anticipated and have high aspirations for that business to grow both units and margin going forward.\nDavid Manthey: I appreciate it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTobey Sommer: Just following up on the Environmental Services and US Ecology business. What's your -- is your changes in your view on the long-term margins that you think you can approach over sort of many years in that business? And I'd love to get your perspective on the disposal market digesting incremental capacity, I think there's an incinerator coming online.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, about 25% free cash flow converges with the recycling and waste business across the cycle, just given the lower capital intensity of that business. Over time, the longer term, we don't see a constraint of why EBITDA margin in that business couldn't be very similar to the recycling waste business. Just given the nature of the products, right? These are very technical complicated waste streams. The limited number of outlets requires a lot of environmental compliance to handle those appropriately on that front. And so, we think that\u2019s very valuable service, and we're going to continue to price for that over time. In terms of new incineration coming online, it's welcomed. The industry has been short supplied for a long period of time, and we don't see that as a challenge or a constraint. We see that as an opportunity, because there's pent-up demand that, that new capacity will be able to fulfill.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. In terms of the pace of M&A, it's been a little bit slower than I had anticipated year-to-date. I was wondering if you could speak to that as well as the margin profile of the targets generally? I'm wondering to the extent supply chain fleet, wage growth, technology and other factors have actually what sort of pressured the margins of the targets that you're looking at.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I mentioned the ebb and flow of pace of M&A. Again, it's not -- we're going to stay disciplined. I think in fact, we just looked at this, we're eight to one, right? For every eight opportunities that we look at, eventually we close one of those. Because we're going to be very disciplined. First is going to have to meet our strategic hurdles and we are the national owners for this. So is it A, fit and B, does it meet our financial stream on that. And so we're looking for cash-on-cash returns double digit post synergy on that. So we're going to remain very disciplined. And again, there's ebb and flow lots of conversations. Sometimes those things break quickly and sometimes they take a little longer, right, in that front. And that's the period we're in right now, but again, our enthusiasm has not changed. In terms of the margin profile, it's less about what it has today and more about what it can become because oftentimes in these businesses, we're going to park the trucks, right? We're going to recapitalize the fleet. We are going to layer into our IT systems, right? Some of those drivers will come over, some won't because we layer it right into our [density] (ph) and so we can take routes out of the system and do the same amount of work and that\u2019s why we drive so much value in these deals.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hi, good afternoon, guys.\nJon Vander Ark: Good afternoon, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, I got a couple of questions here. So first, I want to kind of come back to the implied Q4 guide. But if I use the high end, it implies that Q4 is around $1.2 billion, which I think is down high single digit from Q3, which is just worse than normal seasonality. And I get that you've got the 60 basis points from bad debt and insurance, but it still feels a little conservative? Or am I missing something?\nJon Vander Ark: I would say -- in the opening remarks, we talked about low end of the revenue guide, high end of the EBITDA margin guide. That's -- we're getting towards the end of the year. We're focusing our plans on 2025 on that front. We don't put a lot of time, attention and energy in getting decimal level accurate, right, on updating the guide. We gave you the markers we had and we\u2019re feeling really good about where we're going to end up Q4 and 2025.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That's fair. And then just to be kind of clear on the implied volume guidance in Q4, is there any benefit from hurricane cleanup efforts in there?\nJon Vander Ark: There may be a little bit. Again, we don't plan on that, certainly. Sometimes you get actually a quite a nice lift coming out of these. Sometimes you get a little less than you think about. Our primary focus is, first, taking care of our people. Some of them have been deeply impacted, especially in Helene. And so we're going to get them back on their feet. And when they're back on their feet, they can get back to work on that front. And then on the back end, oftentimes, we end up making some money that helps pay for that more. But if that comes, that's just icing on the gate.\nTyler Brown: And then I want to kind of come at 2025 a little bit different, because I think there's actually quite a bit going on next year. There's actually a number of moving pieces, discrete pieces, if I'm not mistaken, because I think you have polymer, Blue Polymer plants coming online, you mentioned that. I think your RISE platform still has some incremental benefit that you should get, I think you have maybe $40 million of savings to go there. I think MPower comes on, that's going to be a modest benefit, you should have at least some benefit from RNG. So Brian, I don't know if you can, but can you kind of maybe bucket all that together. But how much do those incremental drivers help 2025? Is it $50 million, $100 million? Just any broad buckets would be very helpful, if you can.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. Let's take those. Let's just talk about sustainability innovation, which would include the RNG portfolio, polymer center and blue polymers, right? So next year, if you think about what we're expecting from an incremental, so this would be 2025 over 2024. It's about $75 million of revenue and $30 million to $35 million worth of EBITDA. So again, coming in at a nice incremental accretive margin to the portfolio, primarily driven by the RNG side of that. As you mentioned, we do expect some benefits from MPower. But remember, we're going to deploy that in a phased approach. And we just started the initial business units that are getting that system, so that will be deployed throughout the year. And as we exit 2025, we would expect to be fully deployed. So we called out $20 million of benefit at run rate. So you can kind of think about half of that or so being realized in 2025 with the other half then in 2026. And to your question on the RISE platform and some of the fees that we're generating, we talked about from a fee perspective that we've realized over $60 million of those fees, but that's already in the run rate. right? So we've had that throughout the year, and we're starting to comp that in Q3 of this year. From a product perspective, you can think we've got about $25 million more to go. You can think about half of that coming in 2025, half in 2026.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Okay, perfect. So there's some in 2025 into 2026. Now the other thing is, will there be, based on what we know today an alternative tax credit onset headwind?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: You're talking about the CNG tax credit?\nTyler Brown: Correct. Correct.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. We are not assuming that in 2025, and we just follow the law. And so again, right now, that's set to expire. So that is not included in our projection for 2025.\nJon Vander Ark: And that's about -- for us, that runs about $15 million.\nTyler Brown: Sorry, 15?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: 15.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrian Butler: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first one, can we talk maybe about where internal inflation has been running as compared to the CPI headline kind of what was that trending in the third quarter? And how does that look in the fourth quarter and then, I guess, 2025, if you have any color?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, a good story, right? You're seeing that inflation come down. So I mentioned labor about 4.5%, and that's a pretty good indication of the overall cost inflation. There's some puts and takes in our categories. Maintenance has been a real highlight in terms of that was the category certainly is running hot the last couple of years, and that's improved from lots of different reasons. One, we're getting truck deliveries. So putting out our parking older trucks and taking on new trucks with less maintenance intensity. And then also turnover continues to decline. We're doing more work internally versus outsourcing it to third parties, and that's a cheaper labor rate. Parts inflation certainly modulated as well, so all those pieces are helping on that side. And we expect that continue to improve modestly into 2025, so continued deceleration.\nBrian Butler: Okay. Great. And then when you went through the buckets kind of on what rolls into 2025 for sustainability [ePower] (ph), right? How should we think about the capital spending that's attached to that versus what was spent in 2024?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Relatively consistent. If you remember, when you think about what we're doing when we're investing in RNG, when we're making those investments, that's in a JV structure. So that comes through more like an acquisition than it does CapEx. But when you think about polymer center and when you think about what we're going to do from an EV perspective, we would expect those to be on par what we did this year, slightly higher, but nothing of note to change the CapEx as a percent of revenue.\nBrian Butler: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Hi. Thanks, folks. I think in the last quarter, 32% EBITDA margins could be achievable over time. And [indiscernible]. So well done. I want to ask about Environmental Solutions. I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned it was largely due to the acquisition, but there revenue growth. Can you just talk a little bit about the organic trends in the quarter, maybe how you see the pipeline for the year shaping up?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. There's certainly -- there also been some churn, which I mentioned, right? And we are going to continue to test the bounds of customer willingness to pay. We believe you have to do that as a leader in the marketplace when the services are highly valued. And we also know that customers come back around. They experience with a different provider. And with high-quality service, where we're engaged with them from a safety standpoint, sustainability standpoint, digital standpoint, that has value. Ultimately, those customers oftentimes come back on that front. So little flat -- more flat this year from a volume standpoint than we would have hopped, pricing obviously exceeded our expectations. And when forced to choose, I'll take that trade-off all day. Now I push the team that we want to grow above units and price, and we'll have a plan to do that in 2025.\nNoah Kaye: And to that point, you talked about maybe some faster pace of margin [indiscernible] reasonable to think about for ES versus overall, you talked about the 30 bps for the overall business. Sort of like 100 bps is kind of the right level on an annual basis to be thinking about the segment?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I think we've talked about 80 to 100 basis points kind of across the cycle and some years out a little faster and some years may be slower. But if you look at the trend, I think that's a ratable pace where we could take margins.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Just a follow-up on the last question there. Just in terms of the discussions you're having with your customers as the absolute level of headline inflation is moderating, just their willingness to sort of give that spread over the cost base? And are you finding it easier or harder than it was maybe a year ago and is sort of the directional rate cuts and things like that helping at all? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: I would say broadly, if we're in a world of 2.5%, 3%. 3.5%, 4% inflation, that's a pretty good spot for us to be, right? We've seen what really high inflation looks like, and that was certainly sustainable and are workable for a period of time. Over time, that's very unworkable because of what the Fed will do and as they'll end up crashing the economy to bring that down. We've lived in a period of incredibly low inflation, and that's really hard because we're going to give our people a wage increase every year as we know that their real costs are going to go up on that front. So living in, again, that kind of 3%, 3.5% zone is a really good spot for us to be.\nSabahat Khan: Great. And then just on the volume front, maybe if you can just give some perspective on. I think as these rates get cut, I think you're indicating you want pricing and unit volume growth next year, ideally, maybe just some perspective on your -- what you're seeing on the economic activity of the cyclical units? And then secondly, where you are on the volume churn front, if there's any more, that's still to come in 2025? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I think I mentioned in the past that from a churn standpoint, every time we do M&A, there's always going to be some work that we're going to churn out of the portfolio. There's going to be some municipal contracts. We know that we are going to upgrade or replace in terms of price, and we know that there's likely some broker work that we don't treat those as customers. We treat people who generate recycling and waste as customers. So that's going to get churned out of the portfolio. We're seeing that this year for sure, on that front. And the on cyclical volume, listen, the construction is down [indiscernible] business is certainly down year-over-year 10% from a unit standpoint quarter-over-quarter. And so that's just a reflection of what's happening in the underlying construction activity. And I think what the really good news is, given, again, this broader demand environment, which is when you put all the pieces together, right, something south of flat, right? You're seeing really good pricing behavior and conduct and performance. And I think if you take a look 20 years back, you just would not have seen that. You would have seen people chasing units to try to keep trucks utilized. And what we're doing and others apparently are parking vehicles and understanding that your people need to have a wage increase every year, and it's important to go out and price. And so, I think you're seeing a market that's behaving rationally and that's really beneficial. And as we see, again, really good growth indicators on the horizon, whether that's three months, six months, nine months, but we're pretty optimistic on that front. A little bit of volume will be a really good place to be.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Some of the contract losses as well as Jon mentioned, right, some of this is just comping out some losses that happened earlier in the year. So for example, residential, we were down 2.9% year-over-year in the third quarter. Most of that is going to anniversary as we exit the year. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re necessarily expecting any sort of robust growth in residential. It\u2019s just the absence of a headwind that we\u2019ve been experiencing all year long.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, thanks you. I wanted to go back to the 3Q versus 4Q margin trend. And it seems like I get the 60 basis points of potentially onetime benefit. But is that just taking a step back, is it just commodity prices that are coming down in the fourth quarter that reflects the change in year-over-year margins? Or was there something in the prior year comp to be aware of? Or is there any other factor?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes, I would say, look, as you look at last year, from a prior year comp perspective, historically, you've seen margin step down from Q3 to Q4 and last year, they were flat, right? They were equal to each other. So there's certainly a tougher comp. But as Jon mentioned earlier, we feel really good about our prospects and how we're going to finish up this year, and we'll be able to sit there and tell you how we finish out the year in February.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood. And then just a housekeeping question for 2025, if you can. First, I just want to confirm if there's any level of rollover acquisitions that we should be keeping in mind for 2025. And then like anything below the line, whether its interest expense, I know you have some notes that are coming up or the tax rate or any of those below-the-line type of things that we should keep in mind?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. From a rollover perspective, as we said earlier, about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of rollover based on that, which is already closed. Obviously, that would increase for any deals that we closed in the fourth quarter, right? So we -- again, we can give you some of that flavor when we get back together in February. As far as some of the other components, I mean, if you can take a look at the maturities of what's coming due next year, they are at lower rates than current rates. So we would expect some increase in overall interest expense just due to rate on the fixed rate debt, but nothing overly significant.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question today comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe just to follow up to actually Tyler's question. I appreciate the -- maybe the quantifying the benefit of some of your digital efforts of the RISE platform. But maybe you could remind us what is left in terms of kind of rolling out some of those systems and capabilities. I know this year is putting a lot of tablets in the cabs and making sure you're capturing some of the overhang surcharges, what's next as we think about 2025 as you phase out -- I'm sorry, phase in the next batch of capabilities? Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yes. I mean now that you've got the platform in place really kind of ratcheting up what you do from a route sequencing in order to sit there and optimize those routes and then ultimately, adherence, right? To make sure that the drivers are running the routes as designed. So again, we put this flavor out there before is that a minute across our system is worth about $5 million annually. So it doesn\u2019t take a lot of seconds and minutes to add up to something meaningful, and that's what we think that the next rev of our digital platform can yield.\nJon Vander Ark: And more broadly over the last four or five years, we've done a good job of just rapidly replacing and modernizing all of our systems without taking some big onetime CapEx event or creating any institutional risk, and so we've done it with our marketing and sales. We've done it with HR. We've done it with procurement. We've done it now with our assets. We've done it on the operating side of our business, and we're working on [indiscernible] cash, and there'll be another wave of benefits there as we think about still a lot of transactional work that we can automate on that front. So those will be opportunities that won't hit necessarily in 2025. We'll get some of those, but really into 2026 and 2027. So it's a great story and then it makes the employee value proposition stronger. It provides better customer service, and we're going to be able to operate the business more efficiently.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. It makes a lot of sense. And then maybe switching gears, just to -- on the recycling side of your business, not the polymer centers or the like. So would you just think of your traditional [indiscernible], maybe talk about any kind of retrofitting or automation investments or anything that you might have planned? Or do you feel like you might be implemented here in 2025 for the coming years?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're doing that every year. Every year, we're putting in new optical sorters and taking out manual work and getting more automation. The primary investment we make in our recycling centers is to produce a better product. Now in order to do that, you put in new capital and you end up taking out some labor, but taking out jobs is never our goal. Our goal is to provide the -- to create the best product we can for the marketplace, which drives more circularity and drives a higher price per product on that front. And so -- and we also -- when we do M&A, we pick up some new recycling centers. There'll be a couple over the next few years that we're going to go studs up because there's markets where we need capacity on that front. But most of our investment is the continued upgrading of the existing 75 or 77.\nStephanie Moore: Yes. Thank you so much.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Nick. I want to thank the entire Republic Services team for their commitment to exceeding customer expectations and the continued growth and success of our company. Have a good evening and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered strong third quarter results by effectively executing our strategy that supports profitable growth and value creation. The Republic Services team continues to deliver world-class service and innovative solutions to meet the needs of our customers. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 7% and generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 210 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 and produce $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Through our differentiated capabilities, customers yield, digital and sustainability, we continue to be well positioned to capture new opportunities and create long-term value for our stakeholders. Regarding customer zeal, our focus on delivering world-class essential services continues to support organic growth and enhance customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at more than 94%. Third quarter organic revenue growth was driven by strong pricing across the business. Average yield on total revenue was 4.6%, and average yield on related revenue was 5.5%. This level of pricing continued to exceed our cost inflation and help drive 210 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on total revenue declined 1.2%. Volume losses were heavily concentrated to the cyclical portions of our business, including special waste and construction activity. Turning to our expanding digital capabilities. We continue to advance the implementation of digital tools to improve the experience for both customers and employees. Deployment of MPower, our new fleet and equipment management system is underway. MPower is designed to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhance warranty recovery. Deployment of the new system is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2025. We estimate MPower will deliver $20 million annual cost savings once fully implemented. We continue to benefit from innovative technology on our recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and recycling contamination. This technology generated more than $60 million in incremental revenue in the first year of operation. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewal natural gas position us to continue grow and create long-term value creation. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities continues to move forward. Las Vegas Polymer Center production volumes continued to increase throughout the quarter. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with initial equipment commissioning underway. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. We expect construction on this facility to be complete by the year of this year, with earnings contribution in the second half of 2025. We recently broke ground on a Blue Polymers production facility in Buckeye, Arizona, this facility will complement the Las Vegas Polymer Center. We expect the completion of this facility in late 2025. We continue to bring decarbonization solutions to the market that will unlock value for all of our stakeholders including the communities we serve. The renewable natural gas projects we're developing with our partners continue to advance. Two projects came online during the third quarter, bringing the total completed this year to four projects. We expect four additional RNG projects to be completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to advance our commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 28 electric collection vehicles in operation and expect to have more than 50 EVs in our fleet by the end of the year. We have 18 facilities with commercial scale EV charging infrastructure. As part of our approach to sustainability, we are committed to being an employer of choice in the markets we serve. Our third quarter employee turnover rate improved more than 100 basis points compared to the prior year and we are proud to be certified as a great place to work for the eighth consecutive year. With respect to capital allocation, year-to-date, we have invested $104 million in strategic acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We currently have more than $200 million of transactions that are expected to close by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we returned $834 million to shareholders, which includes $330 million of share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. Thanks, Brian. With respect to 2024, we believe we are trending toward the low end of our full year revenue guidance due to continued softness in cyclical volumes. That said, we expect to more than overcome this revenue headwind and achieved the high end of our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. As a result, we expect EBITDA margin to outperform our expectations. Looking forward to 2025, we expect continued growth across the business supported by pricing ahead of underlying costs, cross-selling our complete set of products and services and capitalizing on value-creating acquisition opportunities. We also expect financial contribution from the investments made in sustainability innovation, including plastic circularity and renewable natural gas projects. We believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow along with margin expansion in the underlying business. Over the long term, we believe our business can consistently deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and grow EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow faster than revenue. Our initial perspective on full year 2025 is consistent with this long-term growth algorithm. We plan to provide detailed 2025 guidance on our earnings call in February. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Sure. Yes. We're really happy in terms of the pricing we're getting. We're beating our pro forma math. Certainly happy on the volume ramp in terms of how that equipment is building. We got off to a little later start than we would have liked for things all unrelated to the equipment. So permitting of the facility, getting electricity in, just getting all the things around the construction on the building envelope. Those things take time. Maybe we were a little aggressive in our time line to begin with. [indiscernible] delayed from the start there, but the underlying assumptions other than a delayed start, we still feel very confident in. And India is hitting its marks, including the construction time line there. So we feel really good about that. Listen, we think we're producing some of the cleanest [lake] (ph) in the world. And so that's what the market needs. It's good for circularity and certainly going to be good for our shareholders as well. And then in terms of moving away from the [industries] (ph) or rotating away from CPI, we continue to maintain incremental progress on that. So couple of big contracts moving to water sewer trash, and it's really some moving to fixed and above them, it's really the portfolio that we think positions us well across the cycle. We mentioned turnover down 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to trend in a really positive direction there. Labor cost inflation is 4.5-ish percent, we're hanging out right there. And again, that cake is largely baked because we start -- we give our people a wage increase at the end of February. On that front, we expect that to step down marginally as we move into next year based on where the current numbers are pointing. And then yes, labor availability is improving. There's still categories like technicians, which have been historically tough in this industry and that you're getting tougher. That's why we vertically integrated into technical education and sort of our own tech Institute and are growing our own and having a lot of success fielding entry-level techs out of that center. Yes. Look, I think across the industry in the last 12 to 18 months, we're in a flat to slightly negative demand environment from a unit standpoint. So it probably hasn't been talked about or well understood. On that front, and it's a cyclical portions driving that. It's also true a little bit in the industrial side of the business, it's where a large container permanent, right, we're gaining customers. So we're gaining share there, but we're seeing activity that has continued to be relatively soft at individual customers on that front. Look, on the construction side, whether this happens in three to six months or it happens in nine to 12 months, I'm optimistic on that side of the business for both commercial and residential. Interest rates coming down certainly helps with that. You've got both sides of the aisle talking about housing policy. We've underbuilt single-family homes in the United States in the last 15 years. And so, there's a lot of pent-up demand on that front. And then we're starting to see some really interesting signs here on special waste and the industrial activity, and there's always a little bit of paralysis in an election year, and we're starting to see a pipeline that's been actually quite strong all year, but jobs haven't moved and those jobs are starting to move here in the fourth quarter. So we're pretty optimistic for the remainder of the year and certainly into 2025. Maybe broader backdrop, coming off three really great years of M&A. Our commitment to M&A has certainly not dwindled and our outlook and our optimism going forward hasn't changed. There's always some ebb and flow. So we closed a couple of really big deals in Q4 last year, first half got off to a little bit of a slower start this year. I think if you put together what we've already done this year and what we expect to close in the fourth quarter, we're more like $300 million where we gave you an indicator of closer to $500 million at the start of the year. A lot of those deals are starting to build here, and so I expect us to have a really good first half next year on that front. So that gives you a sense of kind of the movement on that front. But our -- our outlook and our enthusiasm for M&A remains strong, and we expect that to be a meaningful contributor next year. Yes, definitely there will be people that move faster and people that move slower. I mean we've learned from all kinds of experience that EV isn't just a truck, it's a system, so you need to understand how to put in the infrastructure and get after that early. You need to understand the incentive environment on that front because that certainly accelerates adoption and shortens the payback period, and we've had teams working on that for three years. And given the unlock is somebody building a truly studs up EV vehicle. No one's ever done that in our space before until Oshkosh for their McNeils vehicle. And that's a game changer because that allows you to get enough battery power on the vehicle that you can run a full day without sacrificing payload. And that was always the design parameter we had, which is we're not going to sacrifice productivity to do that. So we're thrilled with the product that we are running. I think there'll be other OEMs. Hopefully, they get there. This [indiscernible] sense people to move, but there's certainly going to be winners and losers in the short to medium term in terms of pace of adoption. Yes. We're certainly not giving 2025 guidance, but an outlook that we've talked about in the prepared remarks and we mentioned often to investors is that, we want to grow revenue mid-single digits and then grow EBITDA margin or EBITDA slightly faster than that, which implies EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow was slightly faster than that. And EBITDA margin across the cycle, kind of, I think, 30 to 50 basis points. Obviously, this year is going to be stronger than that, but we would certainly go into next year kind of in that ZIP code in terms of our expectations of how we're going to expand margin in the business. Yes, all above, it's in every lever. So starting out with -- on the revenue side, it's customer mix. So we're going through verticals and understanding willingness to pay and where we have pricing power and what the more profitable verticals are and less profitable verticals. So you've seen some customer churn in that space this year as we've certainly pushed price because our services are valuable and found lots of willingness to pay and a few people that want to experience lower quality for a period of time in that front. And then just the pricing of -- is the top pricing, very tactical account level pricing, kind of looking at every lever there still more upside, certainly there going forward as we put in the systems and technology to give our team members better tools on that front. And then good cost management, cost discipline, right, better labor utilization. As we get bigger, especially in the field services side of the business, you're able to deploy labor in different markets and therefore, get better utilization rates on that labor. So really proud of the team and the work we've done there. We said we thought we could get to 25% of the midterm target, and there's an ebb and flow across quarters, of course, but we've made faster progress than I think we originally anticipated and have high aspirations for that business to grow both units and margin going forward. Yes, about 25% free cash flow converges with the recycling and waste business across the cycle, just given the lower capital intensity of that business. Over time, the longer term, we don't see a constraint of why EBITDA margin in that business couldn't be very similar to the recycling waste business. Just given the nature of the products, right? These are very technical complicated waste streams. The limited number of outlets requires a lot of environmental compliance to handle those appropriately on that front. And so, we think that's very valuable service, and we're going to continue to price for that over time. In terms of new incineration coming online, it's welcomed. The industry has been short supplied for a long period of time, and we don't see that as a challenge or a constraint. We see that as an opportunity, because there's pent-up demand that, that new capacity will be able to fulfill. Yes, I mentioned the ebb and flow of pace of M&A. Again, it's not -- we're going to stay disciplined. I think in fact, we just looked at this, we're eight to one, right? For every eight opportunities that we look at, eventually we close one of those. Because we're going to be very disciplined. First is going to have to meet our strategic hurdles and we are the national owners for this. So is it A, fit and B, does it meet our financial stream on that. And so we're looking for cash-on-cash returns double digit post synergy on that. So we're going to remain very disciplined. And again, there's ebb and flow lots of conversations. Sometimes those things break quickly and sometimes they take a little longer, right, in that front. And that's the period we're in right now, but again, our enthusiasm has not changed. In terms of the margin profile, it's less about what it has today and more about what it can become because oftentimes in these businesses, we're going to park the trucks, right? We're going to recapitalize the fleet. We are going to layer into our IT systems, right? Some of those drivers will come over, some won't because we layer it right into our [density] (ph) and so we can take routes out of the system and do the same amount of work and that's why we drive so much value in these deals. Good afternoon, Tyler. I would say -- in the opening remarks, we talked about low end of the revenue guide, high end of the EBITDA margin guide. That's -- we're getting towards the end of the year. We're focusing our plans on 2025 on that front. We don't put a lot of time, attention and energy in getting decimal level accurate, right, on updating the guide. We gave you the markers we had and we're feeling really good about where we're going to end up Q4 and 2025. There may be a little bit. Again, we don't plan on that, certainly. Sometimes you get actually a quite a nice lift coming out of these. Sometimes you get a little less than you think about. Our primary focus is, first, taking care of our people. Some of them have been deeply impacted, especially in Helene. And so we're going to get them back on their feet. And when they're back on their feet, they can get back to work on that front. And then on the back end, oftentimes, we end up making some money that helps pay for that more. But if that comes, that's just icing on the gate. And that's about -- for us, that runs about $15 million. Yes, a good story, right? You're seeing that inflation come down. So I mentioned labor about 4.5%, and that's a pretty good indication of the overall cost inflation. There's some puts and takes in our categories. Maintenance has been a real highlight in terms of that was the category certainly is running hot the last couple of years, and that's improved from lots of different reasons. One, we're getting truck deliveries. So putting out our parking older trucks and taking on new trucks with less maintenance intensity. And then also turnover continues to decline. We're doing more work internally versus outsourcing it to third parties, and that's a cheaper labor rate. Parts inflation certainly modulated as well, so all those pieces are helping on that side. And we expect that continue to improve modestly into 2025, so continued deceleration. Yes. There's certainly -- there also been some churn, which I mentioned, right? And we are going to continue to test the bounds of customer willingness to pay. We believe you have to do that as a leader in the marketplace when the services are highly valued. And we also know that customers come back around. They experience with a different provider. And with high-quality service, where we're engaged with them from a safety standpoint, sustainability standpoint, digital standpoint, that has value. Ultimately, those customers oftentimes come back on that front. So little flat -- more flat this year from a volume standpoint than we would have hopped, pricing obviously exceeded our expectations. And when forced to choose, I'll take that trade-off all day. Now I push the team that we want to grow above units and price, and we'll have a plan to do that in 2025. Yes. I think we've talked about 80 to 100 basis points kind of across the cycle and some years out a little faster and some years may be slower. But if you look at the trend, I think that's a ratable pace where we could take margins. I would say broadly, if we're in a world of 2.5%, 3%. 3.5%, 4% inflation, that's a pretty good spot for us to be, right? We've seen what really high inflation looks like, and that was certainly sustainable and are workable for a period of time. Over time, that's very unworkable because of what the Fed will do and as they'll end up crashing the economy to bring that down. We've lived in a period of incredibly low inflation, and that's really hard because we're going to give our people a wage increase every year as we know that their real costs are going to go up on that front. So living in, again, that kind of 3%, 3.5% zone is a really good spot for us to be. Yes. I think I mentioned in the past that from a churn standpoint, every time we do M&A, there's always going to be some work that we're going to churn out of the portfolio. There's going to be some municipal contracts. We know that we are going to upgrade or replace in terms of price, and we know that there's likely some broker work that we don't treat those as customers. We treat people who generate recycling and waste as customers. So that's going to get churned out of the portfolio. We're seeing that this year for sure, on that front. And the on cyclical volume, listen, the construction is down [indiscernible] business is certainly down year-over-year 10% from a unit standpoint quarter-over-quarter. And so that's just a reflection of what's happening in the underlying construction activity. And I think what the really good news is, given, again, this broader demand environment, which is when you put all the pieces together, right, something south of flat, right? You're seeing really good pricing behavior and conduct and performance. And I think if you take a look 20 years back, you just would not have seen that. You would have seen people chasing units to try to keep trucks utilized. And what we're doing and others apparently are parking vehicles and understanding that your people need to have a wage increase every year, and it's important to go out and price. And so, I think you're seeing a market that's behaving rationally and that's really beneficial. And as we see, again, really good growth indicators on the horizon, whether that's three months, six months, nine months, but we're pretty optimistic on that front. A little bit of volume will be a really good place to be. And more broadly over the last four or five years, we've done a good job of just rapidly replacing and modernizing all of our systems without taking some big onetime CapEx event or creating any institutional risk, and so we've done it with our marketing and sales. We've done it with HR. We've done it with procurement. We've done it now with our assets. We've done it on the operating side of our business, and we're working on [indiscernible] cash, and there'll be another wave of benefits there as we think about still a lot of transactional work that we can automate on that front. So those will be opportunities that won't hit necessarily in 2025. We'll get some of those, but really into 2026 and 2027. So it's a great story and then it makes the employee value proposition stronger. It provides better customer service, and we're going to be able to operate the business more efficiently. Yes. We're doing that every year. Every year, we're putting in new optical sorters and taking out manual work and getting more automation. The primary investment we make in our recycling centers is to produce a better product. Now in order to do that, you put in new capital and you end up taking out some labor, but taking out jobs is never our goal. Our goal is to provide the -- to create the best product we can for the marketplace, which drives more circularity and drives a higher price per product on that front. And so -- and we also -- when we do M&A, we pick up some new recycling centers. There'll be a couple over the next few years that we're going to go studs up because there's markets where we need capacity on that front. But most of our investment is the continued upgrading of the existing 75 or 77. Thank you, Nick. I want to thank the entire Republic Services team for their commitment to exceeding customer expectations and the continued growth and success of our company. Have a good evening and be safe."

            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 6.2%, core price on related revenue was 7.4%, which included open market pricing of 9.1% and restricted pricing of 4.8%. The components of core price on related revenue included: small container of 10.3%, large container of 6.9% and residential of 7.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 4.6%, and average yield on related revenue was 5.5%. As expected, average yields stepped down sequentially as we began to anniversary the impact of new fees implemented last year. The fees relate to overfilled containers and recycling contamination and were enabled by our digital platform. Third quarter volume on total revenue decreased 1.2% and volume on related revenue decreased 1.5%. Volume results included a decrease in large container of 3.6%, primarily due to continued softness in construction-related activities a decrease in residential of 2.9%, primarily due to municipal contracts lost in 2023 then anniversary in the fourth quarter of this year. During the quarter, small center volume decreased 40 basis points, while landfill MSW increased 30 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $177 per ton during the third quarter. This compares to $112 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 70 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are currently $106 per ton reflecting a recent decline in the price for recovered cardboard, or OCC. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 210 basis points to 32%. Margin performance during the quarter: margin expansion in the underlying business of 120 basis points, a 40 basis point increase from net fuel, a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 50 basis point benefit from an insurance recovery related to a prior year claim. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions completed in the prior year. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $60 million compared to the prior year, driven by the rollover contribution from prior year acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business expanded 290 basis points to 25.5% in the third quarter. Environmental Solutions EBITDA margin was 22.6% and in the prior year. Environmental Solutions margin included a positive 110 basis points from an adjustment to an allowance for bad debt established in a prior year. Excluding this benefit, Environmental Solutions margin would have been 24.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures. Year to date net capital expenditures of $1.19 billion represents an increase of $250 million or 27% compared to the prior year. Capital spending is more ratable in 2024, whereas 2023 was heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Prior year capital expenditures were impacted by vendor-related delay in truck and equipment deliveries. Total debt $12.6 billion and total liquidity $2.6 billion. Our leverage rate at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.6 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 21.6% during the quarter. This favorable tax rate driven primarily by the timing of equity investments in renewable energy contributed $0.09 of EPS benefit during the quarter. I will now hand back over to Jon. Yes. Thanks, Jerry. Taking a look at the third quarter, we called out the two big pieces that you would sit there and in say, we're somewhat large and unusual for the quarter. So the insurance recovery, which had an impact of a positive 50 basis points to the quarter itself. We called out the bad debt as well. So it was 110 basis points to Environmental Solutions, about 10 basis point contribution to the enterprise taken as a whole. So 60 basis points, we would say, ex that, the rest, I mean, I called out the theses about what fuel and commodity prices were doing, but the underlying business, you saw the strength of that 100 bps. When you take a look at the spread, and we certainly talked about the fact that we thought we were in an elevated pricing environment in part due to the fact that there was the backdrop of elevated inflation. And we've said that throughout this year, that would step down sequentially. And as we look forward into 2025, we would expect that to step down as well. Now, if you take a look back historically, open market pricing has tend to run above that which you can achieve on the restricted portion of the business. I would say right now that spread is probably a little bit more than what I would think about through the cycle. But all that said, we would expect to price in excess of our cost inflation consistent with what we've done over the last couple of years and drive margin expansion in the business. Yes, we're about 61% of those contracts that were historically pegged to headline CPI that have moved to something that we would consider favorable. Yes. If you take a look at the sequential step down from Q2 to Q4, I also point out that the restricted portion of our business went from 5.6% to 4.9%. And that's just on the price increase perspective. So again, that's just reflective of the indices themselves. And again, and as expected, right? We knew that it would step down sequentially, as I mentioned previously, so is our cost inflation. And as long as we can maintain that spread, that's how we drive margin expansion in the business. The rollover impact. Yes. So we would expect right now to see relatively negligible to 2025 growth. It's 10 to 20 basis points at this point. That is correct. Because that only includes that, which is actually closed through the third quarter, there would be a rollover impact of anything that closes in the fourth quarter. Yes. Let's take those. Let's just talk about sustainability innovation, which would include the RNG portfolio, polymer center and blue polymers, right? So next year, if you think about what we're expecting from an incremental, so this would be 2025 over 2024. It's about $75 million of revenue and $30 million to $35 million worth of EBITDA. So again, coming in at a nice incremental accretive margin to the portfolio, primarily driven by the RNG side of that. As you mentioned, we do expect some benefits from MPower. But remember, we're going to deploy that in a phased approach. And we just started the initial business units that are getting that system, so that will be deployed throughout the year. And as we exit 2025, we would expect to be fully deployed. So we called out $20 million of benefit at run rate. So you can kind of think about half of that or so being realized in 2025 with the other half then in 2026. And to your question on the RISE platform and some of the fees that we're generating, we talked about from a fee perspective that we've realized over $60 million of those fees, but that's already in the run rate. right? So we've had that throughout the year, and we're starting to comp that in Q3 of this year. From a product perspective, you can think we've got about $25 million more to go. You can think about half of that coming in 2025, half in 2026. You're talking about the CNG tax credit? Yes. We are not assuming that in 2025, and we just follow the law. And so again, right now, that's set to expire. So that is not included in our projection for 2025. 15. Relatively consistent. If you remember, when you think about what we're doing when we're investing in RNG, when we're making those investments, that's in a JV structure. So that comes through more like an acquisition than it does CapEx. But when you think about polymer center and when you think about what we're going to do from an EV perspective, we would expect those to be on par what we did this year, slightly higher, but nothing of note to change the CapEx as a percent of revenue. Some of the contract losses as well as Jon mentioned, right, some of this is just comping out some losses that happened earlier in the year. So for example, residential, we were down 2.9% year-over-year in the third quarter. Most of that is going to anniversary as we exit the year. So it's not that we're necessarily expecting any sort of robust growth in residential. It's just the absence of a headwind that we've been experiencing all year long. Yes, I would say, look, as you look at last year, from a prior year comp perspective, historically, you've seen margin step down from Q3 to Q4 and last year, they were flat, right? They were equal to each other. So there's certainly a tougher comp. But as Jon mentioned earlier, we feel really good about our prospects and how we're going to finish up this year, and we'll be able to sit there and tell you how we finish out the year in February. Yes. From a rollover perspective, as we said earlier, about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of rollover based on that, which is already closed. Obviously, that would increase for any deals that we closed in the fourth quarter, right? So we -- again, we can give you some of that flavor when we get back together in February. As far as some of the other components, I mean, if you can take a look at the maturities of what's coming due next year, they are at lower rates than current rates. So we would expect some increase in overall interest expense just due to rate on the fixed rate debt, but nothing overly significant. Yes. I mean now that you've got the platform in place really kind of ratcheting up what you do from a route sequencing in order to sit there and optimize those routes and then ultimately, adherence, right? To make sure that the drivers are running the routes as designed. So again, we put this flavor out there before is that a minute across our system is worth about $5 million annually. So it doesn't take a lot of seconds and minutes to add up to something meaningful, and that's what we think that the next rev of our digital platform can yield."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJon Vander Ark: Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong second quarter results reflect the continued positive momentum in our business and are a direct outcome of executing our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business while enhancing profitability by providing world-class service and solutions to our customers. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 9%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 110 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.61, and produced $1.15 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital, and sustainability. Regarding customer zeal, our commitment to delivering world-class essential services and sustainability offerings continues to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at more than 94% and net promoter scores continue to improve. Customers value our comprehensive service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Organic revenue growth during the second quarter was driven by strong pricing across the business. Average yield on total revenue was 5.5% and average yield on related revenue was 6.6%. This level of pricing exceeded our cost inflation and drove 110 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on total revenue declined 80 basis points or 1% on related revenue. Volume losses were heavily concentrated to the cyclical portions of our business, including construction activity. Turning to our expanding digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improves the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. MPower, our new fleet and equipment management system, was introduced to pilot locations earlier this month. MPower is expected to increase maintenance, technician productivity, and enhance warranty recovery. We expect to continue deploying the new system to all locations under a phased approach through the end of 2025. We estimate MPower will drive $20 million of annual cost savings once fully implemented. We continue to benefit from innovative technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfilled containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology reduces contamination at our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million in incremental annual revenue. To date, we have already achieved $45 million of benefit. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that creating a more sustainable world is both our responsibility and a platform for growth. Earlier today, we released our latest sustainability report highlighting the progress we are making toward our 2030 goals and the positive impact we're delivering to our customers and the communities we serve. Our 2030 goals are supported by investments we are making in polymer centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects, and fleet electrification. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities continues to move forward. Major customers have certified the plastic flake produced at our Las Vegas Polymer Center. Production volumes continue to ramp and we expect to achieve our run-rate output targets in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with equipment installation underway. The operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. We expect construction on this facility to be complete by the end of the year with earnings contributions beginning in mid-2025. The renewable natural gas projects we're developing with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the second quarter. Additionally, we completed construction at our RNG project in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This will be the first project to come online in our joint venture with BP. We expect five additional projects to be completed in the second half of this year. We continue to bring decarbonization solutions to the market, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 16 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect to have more than 50 EVs in our collection fleet by the end of the year. We now have nine facilities with commercial-scale EV charging infrastructure, and we expect five additional new sites to be completed in 2024. Customers are looking for solutions to support their sustainability goals. We recently announced an agreement with the City of Louisville, Colorado, making it the first municipality to adopt a fully electric residential collection service. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets we serve. Employee turnover continues to improve with second quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year. With respect to capital allocation, year-to-date we have invested $68 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. We currently have more than $300 million of transactions in advanced stages of diligence and are expected to close by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we returned $504 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced an increase to the dividend for the 21st consecutive year. Strong results we produced through the first half of the year support a full-year earnings outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in the range of $16.075 billion to $16.125 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.925 billion, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.15 to $6.20, and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion. Our updated financial guidance includes the contributions from acquisitions closed through June 30th. I will now turn the call over to Brian who will provide more details on the quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, John. Core price on total revenue was 6.8%. Core price on related revenue was 8.1% which included open market pricing of 9.8% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 7.4%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.5% and average yield on related revenue was 6.6%. Second quarter volume on total revenue decreased 80 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1%. Our volume results included a decrease in large container of 3.3%, primarily due to continued softness in construction-related activity, and a decrease in residential of 2.5%, primarily due to municipal contracts lost in 2023, that anniversary in the fourth quarter of this year. During the quarter, small container volume decreased 60 basis points, while landfill MSW increased 1.1%. Small container volume loss is a direct result of intentionally shedding broker-related business obtained through M&A transactions. We continue to adhere to our longstanding strategy of prioritizing direct relationships with our customers. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $173 per ton during the second quarter. This compared to $119 per ton in the prior year. Recycling, processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. Our updated full year guidance assumes commodity prices remain at approximately $170 per ton for the remainder of the year. And now turning to our environmental solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $74 million compared to the prior year fueled by price-led organic growth and contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 40 basis points to total company internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business expanded 130 basis points to 23.8% in the second quarter. Environmental solutions EBITDA margin was 22.5% in the prior year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 31.1%. Margin performance during the quarter included margin expansion in the underlying business of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices. This was partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.15 billion. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures. Year-to-date net capital expenditures of $767 million represents an increase of $234 million or 44% compared to the prior year. Capital spending is more ratable in 2024, whereas \u201823 was heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Prior year capital expenditures were impacted by vendor-related delays in truck and equipment deliveries. Total debt was $13.1 billion, and total liquidity was $3.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.5% during the quarter. We expect a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%. With that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was hoping to ask about sustainability projects in the wake of the Chevron decision. It sounds like you're still going strong with your projects. Just wondering if you think there will be any impacts affecting the market, for example, supply and demand for RINs as a result of the decision? and then maybe separately, in light of the US election coming up, would that impact timing of any projects, M&A or anything else not related to sustainability, just anything in general that that you'd call out? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yeah, listen, we feel good about the project and our approach specifically on landfill gas to energy. As you know, we're in a joint venture model and there's a series of independent decisions around projects. And so, to be said that, the RINs market changes and that takes some of those projects kind of below our return threshold, those are projects that we won't do on that front. But keep in mind also that we had a very conservative set of assumptions on $2 RINS and we built out the initial set of assumptions and what we talked to you about financial impact. So we still feel really confident, which ties into the second point. There'll be puts and takes, whether there's an administration change and there'll certainly be a new President, whether that's a party change or not. I think in general the conventional wisdom as a Republican administration is going to be more business friendly and a Democratic one maybe less business friendly. I think if you look at the last three years, our business has performed really well in the context of a Democratic administration. So I think in any environment we feel confident there'll be some puts or takes on the margin for sure but we'll -- our team will navigate that.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And then as a follow-up, just want to ask about volume. Bit of a late quarter again I think you called out the large container and then also some of the resi contracts from 2023 on the muni side. Are you still thinking that this year will be flat to modestly positive on volume and just anything to flesh out the sort of slightly lower top line guide? Thanks.\nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yeah, I think from a volume standpoint, we'll be slightly below our original expectations and that's a function of, listen, the construction market's still pretty challenged. With high interest rates, commercial construction activity and residential construction activity have been very muted and you see that our volume numbers in [temp] (ph) large container the great news is that pricing is holding up and I think the industry is behaving very responsibly in that context. And I also am relatively optimistic that that is somewhat of a short-term phenomenon. We need more housing stock in the United States. I think you're starting to see rays of hope here on interest rates cuts, which I think will be the catalyst for that to happen, whether that happens three months from now or six or nine months from now. I do think that's more transitory versus permanent on that front. And then there's also been, again, you talked about the residential contracts. We've accelerated some of the broker exits that we acquired in our M&A deals we always talk about, we require somebody we never value to work on brokers because we know it's going to matriculate out of the system. We've accelerated that, so that drove a little bit of outsized volume decline in the quarter. And then for the overall revenue guide, part of that is the volume outlook, which I just gave you. Part of that is the sustainability projects, landfill gas to energy. We're going to hit our number. The timing of the starts of those is going to be a little bit later in the year. I think ourselves and the industry have faced a little bit of delays in terms of permitting, getting the equipment in place, et cetera. So that's not a big surprise. And then our polymer center, well, we\u2019ve teams executing phenomenally in terms of the product we're producing. We got to a little bit of a later start than we expected through all kinds of things ancillary to the system like permitting for the facility and other things, so that caused a little delay in the timing on that front. Again, that's transitory and we'll be on full run rate as I discussed in my prepared remarks.\nToni Kaplan: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good afternoon.\nJon Vander Ark: Afternoon.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Brian, any color on the shape of pricing into the back half? Should we expect it to sequentially decelerate in Q3 and Q4? And just any color on how that might impact margins, because it does feel like the margin expansion is expected to slow. My hunch is that's largely in Q4 but any color there would be helpful.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. And Tyler, good observation. We talked about -- in Q1 we thought that would be our highest level of pricing of this year and then it would sequentially decline in part just because of some of the index-based pricing and just the impact that has throughout the year. As you've seen, though, we've also seen cost moderate, cost inflation moderate, so our spread we've maintained. So we have a similar level of margin expansion in Q1 and Q2. We would expect that spread to decrease a little bit as we move into the second half of the year. But again, if you take a look, driving outsized margin expansion and well above our initial expectations.\nTyler Brown: Right, okay, that's very helpful. So I believe, if my math is correct, this was the first quarter that you guys had put up a 32% core solid waste margin, if my math is right. But if we go back, you guys have always said that this could be a 32% EBITDA margin business, price compounds, recycling normalizers, and both have. So, since 32% was the new 30%, just any high-level thoughts on what the new 32% could be over the next few years? I mean, is there any reason to believe that a mid-30% margin in core solid waste couldn't be achievable in time if price-cost dynamics cooperate?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, and Tyler, I think our words were that we saw that in the near term, we saw 32% as achievable. Really what we're looking at is the consistent cadence of margin expansion across our business and we talked about that in the 30 to 40 basis point of margin expansion, the recycling waste business a little bit more in the environment solutions, call it, 75 basis points plus just given where it is in its maturity. And so we continue to see that opportunity as we move forward. So we're not going to call what the theoretical cap is, but again, it's about pricing in excess of cost inflation. It's about realizing the benefits from our initiatives, including our digital initiatives, and driving costs out of the system. And we see that runway for years to come.\nTyler Brown: Excellent. My last one real quick. So, Jon, there have been a number of deals, excuse me, and call it hazardous waste/industrial waste/nontraditional waste markets. Some are big, some are small. But can you just talk about your appetite specifically in that market? Will it be slow and steady or would you entertain something that would be much chunkier?\nJon Vander Ark: Listen, we look at everything. We have made a perspective on any type of transaction and if it's going to create value for our shareholders and fits with us strategically, we'll certainly be at the table on that front. So, plus that we do about 20 deals a year on average over the last decade. Most of those are the small tuck-ins, which we're great at and we've got a good pipeline looking forward. And then the bigger ones become more opportunistic, just in terms of is it a fit for us time-wise? Does it create value? Are we the natural owner of that? Again, you'll see us be active in that space over time.\nTyler Brown: Perfect. Thank you all.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I can follow up on that, just given some of the activity we've seen in kind of this hazardous waste environmental service space on the M&A front, are you seeing any changes in the transaction multiples or the type of assets coming to sale that might give you an opportunity to fill in service areas you want to pursue or white space on the map that might come available?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, there's plenty of opportunities, no question. On the small tuck-ins on the environmental solutions side of the business, we've been intentionally a little bit slow on that this year because the team is doing a lot of integration work from an IT standpoint. And again, it's very analogous to recycling and waste. We create value in that space because we've got well-run systems, highly integrated, and we can take a smaller company and layer that operationally right into our density and just draft right off of our systems. Until we get that on the environmental solutions side, you're just adding to your complexities, you're not getting that synergy. And so you'll see us, again, that pipeline is building, you'll see us be much more active next year in the space.\nKevin Chiang: And just anything on the transaction multiples you're seeing, has that changed at all, versus, let's say, 18 months to 24 months ago?\nJon Vander Ark: I think it's consistent, which is there's variation in deals that may be of a little lower quality from our perspective. I think the high quality deals, right, you're going to pay certainly a higher multiple for. But then I think we've done -- got a good example of that with the US Ecology acquisition. If you buy something quality and you've got a plan against it, you can certainly drive value post-acquisition.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just on the EV comments you made in your prepared remarks, you talked about the nine EV infrastructure sites you have. You'll have five new ones or five additional ones by the end of 2024 and you'll have, I guess, a target of 50 EVs. Are those -- when you think of those 14 sites at year-end, I guess how many electric vehicles could you support based on the, I guess, the exit rate infrastructure platform you will have invested in? Is it significantly more than 50 or is it, kind of 50 is the right number and if you want to grow more than that you'd have to make more investments into your charging infrastructure?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, no, it's hundreds. So think about putting in the initial infrastructure and getting connected to the grid and then you think about charging stations which become modular once that infrastructure is put in. And so the strategy is we're going a five-year outplan on each of these sites to understand that we'll be layering more vehicles in. And so you're bearing the upfront cost right now and then it's just an incremental cost to put in the charging station as the fleet grows in that space.\nKevin Chiang: Okay, that's what's happening. Okay, perfect. Thanks for the clarification there. That's all from me. Congrats on a good quarter.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll start with environmental services. Just on the organic performance of the business, pretty big sequential improvement in the trends quarter-over-quarter, you had a headwind organically in the segment last quarter, and I know you called out some weather events and the like, but then to go to kind of this sort of mid-single-digit organic growth in the segment this quarter. Can you just maybe help us understand what you saw from the business on an organic basis and how to think about organic growth going forward through the balance of the year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, strongly -- we're still in the growth mode in that business, right? And so we're -- recycling and waste is a very mature business and we could kind of give you a really clear and clean outlook, right? There's going to be a little more up and down in this business as we grow and build it out and part of that is on the customer side. On one hand we are churning out customers on one end of the business who weren't willing to pay returns and -- to beat our returns and we're going to put upward pressure on industry pricing as we always do. And on the flip side, we're layering cross-sell opportunities that we've talked about. And so those don't all come in kind of ratably month to month. Those come in kind of in different timing and waves. So really pleased with the progress. I'd encourage you on that business, if you're measuring it by the quarter, right, you're probably not going to get the best signal quarter to quarter if that's over the next one to two years certainly. Measuring it over the year, I think, gives you a much better view of the trajectory and we're really pleased on both the top line and certainly bottom line performance of that business.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And Noah, just based on when we put in our annual price increase, we didn't see the full impact of that until the second quarter. And so I think that's also reflective of what you're seeing in EBITDA margin performance of that business at the same time.\nNoah Kaye: Very good points. Do you feel comfortable underwriting organic growth, [turn to] (ph) the PIs for the balance of the year?\nJon Vander Ark: I'm sorry, do we expect organic growth for the balance of the year?\nNoah Kaye: Are you expecting, like embedded in the outlook, are you expecting organic growth in -- for the balance of the year?\nJon Vander Ark: Yes, yeah, we are. And if you know that business and nature of it, because it's so mix sensitive, there isn't a very clear kind of unit versus price, the kind of pair apart or peel apart volume versus price like we do in recycling and waste. And it hasn't been for lack of trying, but there's just too many variables that don't allow us to do that, but underlying organic unit growth will be there.\nNoah Kaye: Very helpful. Just on the margins, really strong performance here. I wondered if we could maybe unpack a little bit that underlying 130 bps as you provided some nuggets in the past that would be helpful. And then I think to put additional color on the response to Tyler's question, it seems like we could be looking at margins up maybe 100 bps or so year-over-year in 3Q and kind of flattish in 4Q. If there's any kind of nuance you would give in terms of how to shape that, that would be helpful for modeling purposes.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, let me start with your -- the last part of your question first. I think the shape, you're on the right path there. Maybe a little bit less in Q3 and a little bit more in Q4, but I think the shape, you're directionally correct. Looking at the performance in the underlying business, we saw 120 basis points in recycling waste. We saw actually more than that in the environmental solutions business because for the 130 basis points for the company taken as a whole, remember we had to overcome 80 to 100 basis points of dilution from acquisition we completed in the environmental solutions business in Q4 of \u201823. So, when you take a look at the underlying business within environmental solutions, it was close to 200 basis points.\nNoah Kaye: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Please go ahead.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. In the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned a little bit of intentional shedding in the small container business. I was maybe just wondering if you could expand on that, give us a sense of the size of the brokerage business you're running there, or maybe it's possible to say maybe what inning the volume shedding is in at this point?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, I'd say the good news is, from an ongoing standpoint, right, we had a bigger broker business a decade ago, and we made a very clear choice that we believe customers are people who generate recycling waste, and we want to have direct relationships with them. So, we're very intentional. What's happened is over the last four or five years, as we've become much more acquisitive, we've seen that portion of the business increase because when we acquire companies, we see that 10% of their book, for example, might be serving brokers. And we don't value $0.01, right, when we pay the purchase price of the deal, because we know that business is going to come out of the system. Typically, we do that over the course of six to maybe even 12 or 18 months honoring contracts in a very ratable fashion, right? In this case, we accelerated it because we felt like with one broker, in particular, we had a receivables risk. And so we took more accelerated action. But there'll always be a small portion of the business that's going to be a drag on our revenue that we're shedding because it's coming in through M&A.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: And a point that I'd make there as well is that if you take a look at the volume decline in small container, it was almost exclusively due to these broker-related losses. If you take a look in the open market, we're actually seeing positive unit growth in that business.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it, got it, that makes total sense. Just kind of last question for me, it's just on the guidance increase, apologies if I missed this. Is it possible to maybe just bucket maybe what is going better on the net price side or just kind of touch on it anecdotally, is it prices coming in higher, cost coming in lower? Is it labor? Is it repair? Just any finer points you can kind of put on what's really been better throughout the first six months. Thank you and I'll turn it over.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, I would say overall we're looking at price in a similar way that we did in the beginning of the year. I would say the spread between price and cost inflation is favorable. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing the better than expected margin expansion. And then I would say the other big piece is really just favorable commodity prices and the flowthrough that has to the bottom line. But an overwhelming majority, again, is going to be in that price-cost spread.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I'm wondering if we could talk about...\nJon Vander Ark: Hey, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Hi. I'm wondering if we could just talk about free cash flow conversion. So, you folks are now up to the mid-40s in EBITDA, the free cash flow conversion, and that's while making the growth investments that you spoke about earlier. As we think about what the free cash flow conversion will look like once the growth investments are producing EBITDA and cash flow, is it reasonable to think about free cash conversion ultimately rising to the high 40s or what kind of [guidepost] (ph) would you think about over the next couple of years as you complete those CapEx and get the cash flow coming in?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, what I would say, Jerry, is that, again, back to we're not looking at a theoretical cap, we're just looking for that consistent improvement in performance. So our expectations is that just, because again, when you think about some of the things that we can do on the balance sheet as far as improving working capital, being more efficient with the CapEx, start with the, 30 to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion we expect, growing free cash flow conversion a little bit more. Now that said, we've got to overcome things like the expiration of bonus depreciation and some other things that we've had to sit there and overcome that are a little bit outside of our control. So you got to overcome that. From the base business though, you can think of that, call it 50 to 75 basis points of improvement. And then you got to net out the impact of bonus depreciation, which is different by year.\nJerry Revich: Got it. Thanks, Brian. And then on the US Ecol ERP rollout, it was an area of opportunity for you folks. Can you just update us on the timing and, which point will we get the sort of route level intelligence that you folks are used to for your overall business that could drive some further margin opportunities?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, we'd see being on a common platform, right, on that business, on the environmental solutions business in early \u201825, then we can then iterate the system itself in order to be able to get smarter with respect to the information that we have. So we can be more strategic with respect to pricing, get better as far as productivity, and just become more profitable over time. But right now, we still have a number of systems that we're trying just first to consolidate, then we can continue to enhance and improve the system that we're operating on.\nJerry Revich: Super, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSabahat Khan: Hey, great. Thanks and good afternoon. You provided a bit of color on sort of the M&A landscape. I guess within this guidance, are you still sort of on pace for this $500 million for the full year? Maybe we can just talk about the availability of transactions at the right multiples. Obviously, some big transactions out there, but trying to see what you're facing out there on the smaller tuck-in acquisition types and just sort of pace for the rest of the year.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, the pipeline looks good. Keep in mind, we don't operate the business for the quarter. We operate it forever. So we did $800 million of acquisitions in Q4 last year. So there's some natural lumpiness, especially the M&A pipeline. So a little quieter for the first quarter. This year, listen, we could end up at $500 million. We could end up between, $400 million to $500 million or we could end up north of $500 million if other stuff kicks in here. I think we'll be north of $400 million just based on what we have in front of us. And then do we get closer to $500 million or above that, we'll see kind of what happens. Sometimes deals hit you and they're in an accelerated fashion. Most of the time at this point, we're kind of looking at a Q1 and Q2 for close for those transactions. So anything bigger would certainly be at a little bit of a longer timeframe in terms of a close in next year, wouldn't close this year anything more substantial.\nSabahat Khan: Okay, great. And then maybe if you could just share a little bit of color on some of the cost line items as you think about the back end of this year and heading into \u201825, how are some of the costs that you're seeing on the ground level comparing to some of the headline inflation numbers maybe across labor and some of the other bigger line items? Thank you.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, we certainly saw good sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 across maintenance, transportation, labor that -- the cake is already baked on labor for the year, but the comp year-over-year is certainly improving on that. So, as Brian mentioned, that's certainly what's fueling, along with price, our margin expansion. And we seek a continued modulation of that in the second half of the year. So feel really good about the team's execution on cost control.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I was hoping you'd give us an update on the $100 million digital opportunity that you previously outlined, and the MPower asset management system that you talked about, the $20 million benefit there, is that included or separate from the $100 million?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, so I think, David, I think you're talking about our RISE digital platform. So we said there was $100 million of opportunity. They're cumulative and we've realized about $65 million to date and we would expect to continue to sit there and realize those benefits in future periods, which is embedded in that 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion that we're calling for on a regular cadence, that would certainly be part of that over the next couple years.\nDavid Manthey: But the new asset management system, that's not in the $100 million, it's separate.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Sure that\u2019s -- sorry, I think [indiscernible] that's an additional $20 million. Now, it's going to be deployed in a phased approach. So we actually just hit our first pilot locations. We're going to be deploying that through the end of 2025. So we really don't expect to get that full run rate benefit until 2026.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. Okay. And then if I heard you right on the margin improvement in environmental solutions, are there areas of the legacy US ecology business that you've leaned into or maybe de-emphasized over the past two years that have helped improve the mix of that business or is the pricing and efficiency that you're getting just by using the legacy systems and seeing some improvement there?\nJon Vander Ark: No, it's all of the above. It's certainly pricing for the value we're delivering. It is challenging then the mix, right? We make more money in certain, especially in the field services side of the business, you make more money in certain areas and less in others. And then even within some of those categories of in field service challenging each customer account. What isn't really earning their cost of capital and therefore those are things we're pricing or replacing over time and the team's done a great job of that. I'd say as we get our IT systems in place, which Del talked about, that gives us an opportunity to get even more refined and drive even more value from a pricing standpoint.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to take maybe a high-level view here. I [Technical Difficulty] margin expansion opportunity over the next, I think this year you've given them color, but I think about 2025 and maybe even early 2026. I think if you put together everything that you've outlined, whether continuing nice price costs for solid waste, nice ES expansion, some of your R&G or polymer centers coming online here at the end of the year, it kind of makes it seem like we could see another outsized year of margin expansion, all things considered, for the foreseeable future beyond 2024. Is there anything I'm missing there, or how would you kind of frame the margin opportunity here beyond 2024?\nJon Vander Ark: Well, I think Del highlighted earlier, think about recycling of waste 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion a year. We talked about environmental solutions, getting to 25%. Now again, we're reaching there, getting there probably a little quicker than we thought. But again, there'll be some ups and downs in any given quarter. But over the sequence, certainly have line of sight to 25% margin for the year on that category. And then that's not the ending point, right? We'll continue to move. I think in the long term, we would aspire to have EBITDA margins across the two different parts of our business that converge over time, because we think there's that much opportunity and value that's delivered in the environmental solutions space. And again, that's a long-term target on that, but I've given you kind of a marker for kind of what kind of ratable improvement. And we're reticent to kind of choose an individual year because again, that's not how we run the business. We run it forever.\nStephanie Moore: Great, that's helpful. And then maybe as you think about the pricing environment as the year progresses and more so next year, just kind of your mix across various index-based pricing, kind of your thoughts about potentially above historical average pricing, even as inflation comes down? Thanks.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah. So, again, we've talked about our initiative in order to move to those favorable indices, water sewer trash, garbage trash, and those tend to run higher than CPI. So if you're going back and comparing to five or six years ago, yes, we would expect the restricted portion of our book to perform better than it had historically. But, we've made really good progress and movement against that. So, again, we're close to 60% of that book that was historically linked to CPI now on a favorable index or a fixed rate increase. So that's already reflected in the numbers that you saw in, or that you're seeing in 2024. But certainly, yes, we would expect to be better than where we were historically.\nStephanie Moore: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrian Butler: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Let's start with just on the small container side. When you think about the service intervals, maybe some color on how that's trending and what you kind of have built into the back half of \u201924? Maybe if you exclude the brokerage piece, how positive was the small container volume side?\nJon Vander Ark: Yeah, so service increases continue to exceed decreases. And as I mentioned, for net new business within our open market small container is positive. So if you just take the open market, it would have been modestly positive. I would sit there and say, in the quarter, which was completely offset by what we saw from the broker-related business.\nBrian Butler: Okay. And then the second question, when you think about the midpoint guidance kind of going up on EBITDA, kind of $60 million, $65 million, And you break that out, you talked about price cost being the biggest chunk of that. Can you give some color just on how big maybe the recycling is on a dollar amount for that kind of increase?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah, so it's, call it, 25 to 30 with the balance all being in the underlying business.\nBrian Butler: All right, and if I could squeeze one last one in there, is your sensitivity to the RIN prices really changed at all? I mean, RINs have been kind of elevated for a while now, but maybe just if you have any color on kind of where that sensitivity kind of stands.\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Our sensitivity hasn't changed that much just because we haven't added that much to the portfolio. It will certainly -- that sensitivity will increase over time as more projects come online. But right now, if you think about just rough math, a $0.10 change in RIN prices is approximately $1 million of operating income annual for us.\nBrian Butler: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. On the acquisition front, over time, is $500 million a good number for annual spend, or does that change as we go out in the future because the company clearly is growing and perhaps that needs to increase to maintain the same impact?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Yeah we don't really have a target on the acquisition number. And so we kind of give you a rough guide because it's helpful, I think, for your modeling purposes. But as we think about opportunities, right, we want to buy companies that can first fit our strategic filter. We think we're the natural owner there and we can create value for our customers and then the financial filter, which is -- are we going to exceed our cost of capital and create economic profit for our shareholders. Those are the two things we look at. And so we're not opportunity -- we're not capital constrained in that respect. And so [to the extent] (ph) we find those opportunities, we're going to go do that. So, we've spent as much as $3 billion in a given year, and this year is going to be a little more muted, obviously, partly, again, for the internal constraint of we want to make sure that we can digest and execute what we buy over time. So we'll give you an update as we go get into 2025 what we think the outlook is, but it's going to be more of a year-to-year look than some longer-term outlook of what we're going to spend.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. On the employee attrition front, I know it's down from the peak of several years ago and that helps labor expense and margin expansion, but if I look at it from a different angle and say how low has it gotten before during economic slowdowns and downturns, how far away are we from that at this juncture?\nBrian DelGhiaccio: Well, I'd say if you think about we're at, right, kind of our benchmark level, if you think about any normal run of period. Now, if you take a very short look, like, April and May of 2020, after COVID hit, right, it dropped near zero because everyone was just trying to hold on and figure out what's happening in the world. But if you think about any longer run across a set of quarters, we're certainly at our best performance and we're not stopping. We think there's further opportunity for improvement. Obviously, the rate of improvement will slow. Zero is never the right answer in this category, but we think we can get better.\nOperator: At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, Nick. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their focus on exceeding customer expectations and commitment to driving value for all of our stakeholders. Have a wonderful rest of the summer and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong second quarter results reflect the continued positive momentum in our business and are a direct outcome of executing our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business while enhancing profitability by providing world-class service and solutions to our customers. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 9%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 110 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.61, and produced $1.15 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital, and sustainability. Regarding customer zeal, our commitment to delivering world-class essential services and sustainability offerings continues to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at more than 94% and net promoter scores continue to improve. Customers value our comprehensive service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Organic revenue growth during the second quarter was driven by strong pricing across the business. Average yield on total revenue was 5.5% and average yield on related revenue was 6.6%. This level of pricing exceeded our cost inflation and drove 110 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on total revenue declined 80 basis points or 1% on related revenue. Volume losses were heavily concentrated to the cyclical portions of our business, including construction activity. Turning to our expanding digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improves the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. MPower, our new fleet and equipment management system, was introduced to pilot locations earlier this month. MPower is expected to increase maintenance, technician productivity, and enhance warranty recovery. We expect to continue deploying the new system to all locations under a phased approach through the end of 2025. We estimate MPower will drive $20 million of annual cost savings once fully implemented. We continue to benefit from innovative technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfilled containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology reduces contamination at our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million in incremental annual revenue. To date, we have already achieved $45 million of benefit. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that creating a more sustainable world is both our responsibility and a platform for growth. Earlier today, we released our latest sustainability report highlighting the progress we are making toward our 2030 goals and the positive impact we're delivering to our customers and the communities we serve. Our 2030 goals are supported by investments we are making in polymer centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects, and fleet electrification. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities continues to move forward. Major customers have certified the plastic flake produced at our Las Vegas Polymer Center. Production volumes continue to ramp and we expect to achieve our run-rate output targets in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with equipment installation underway. The operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. We expect construction on this facility to be complete by the end of the year with earnings contributions beginning in mid-2025. The renewable natural gas projects we're developing with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the second quarter. Additionally, we completed construction at our RNG project in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This will be the first project to come online in our joint venture with BP. We expect five additional projects to be completed in the second half of this year. We continue to bring decarbonization solutions to the market, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 16 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect to have more than 50 EVs in our collection fleet by the end of the year. We now have nine facilities with commercial-scale EV charging infrastructure, and we expect five additional new sites to be completed in 2024. Customers are looking for solutions to support their sustainability goals. We recently announced an agreement with the City of Louisville, Colorado, making it the first municipality to adopt a fully electric residential collection service. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets we serve. Employee turnover continues to improve with second quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year. With respect to capital allocation, year-to-date we have invested $68 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. We currently have more than $300 million of transactions in advanced stages of diligence and are expected to close by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we returned $504 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced an increase to the dividend for the 21st consecutive year. Strong results we produced through the first half of the year support a full-year earnings outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in the range of $16.075 billion to $16.125 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.925 billion, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.15 to $6.20, and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion. Our updated financial guidance includes the contributions from acquisitions closed through June 30th. I will now turn the call over to Brian who will provide more details on the quarter. Sure. Yeah, listen, we feel good about the project and our approach specifically on landfill gas to energy. As you know, we're in a joint venture model and there's a series of independent decisions around projects. And so, to be said that, the RINs market changes and that takes some of those projects kind of below our return threshold, those are projects that we won't do on that front. But keep in mind also that we had a very conservative set of assumptions on $2 RINS and we built out the initial set of assumptions and what we talked to you about financial impact. So we still feel really confident, which ties into the second point. There'll be puts and takes, whether there's an administration change and there'll certainly be a new President, whether that's a party change or not. I think in general the conventional wisdom as a Republican administration is going to be more business friendly and a Democratic one maybe less business friendly. I think if you look at the last three years, our business has performed really well in the context of a Democratic administration. So I think in any environment we feel confident there'll be some puts or takes on the margin for sure but we'll -- our team will navigate that. Sure. Yeah, I think from a volume standpoint, we'll be slightly below our original expectations and that's a function of, listen, the construction market's still pretty challenged. With high interest rates, commercial construction activity and residential construction activity have been very muted and you see that our volume numbers in [temp] (ph) large container the great news is that pricing is holding up and I think the industry is behaving very responsibly in that context. And I also am relatively optimistic that that is somewhat of a short-term phenomenon. We need more housing stock in the United States. I think you're starting to see rays of hope here on interest rates cuts, which I think will be the catalyst for that to happen, whether that happens three months from now or six or nine months from now. I do think that's more transitory versus permanent on that front. And then there's also been, again, you talked about the residential contracts. We've accelerated some of the broker exits that we acquired in our M&A deals we always talk about, we require somebody we never value to work on brokers because we know it's going to matriculate out of the system. We've accelerated that, so that drove a little bit of outsized volume decline in the quarter. And then for the overall revenue guide, part of that is the volume outlook, which I just gave you. Part of that is the sustainability projects, landfill gas to energy. We're going to hit our number. The timing of the starts of those is going to be a little bit later in the year. I think ourselves and the industry have faced a little bit of delays in terms of permitting, getting the equipment in place, et cetera. So that's not a big surprise. And then our polymer center, well, we've teams executing phenomenally in terms of the product we're producing. We got to a little bit of a later start than we expected through all kinds of things ancillary to the system like permitting for the facility and other things, so that caused a little delay in the timing on that front. Again, that's transitory and we'll be on full run rate as I discussed in my prepared remarks. Afternoon. Listen, we look at everything. We have made a perspective on any type of transaction and if it's going to create value for our shareholders and fits with us strategically, we'll certainly be at the table on that front. So, plus that we do about 20 deals a year on average over the last decade. Most of those are the small tuck-ins, which we're great at and we've got a good pipeline looking forward. And then the bigger ones become more opportunistic, just in terms of is it a fit for us time-wise? Does it create value? Are we the natural owner of that? Again, you'll see us be active in that space over time. Yeah, there's plenty of opportunities, no question. On the small tuck-ins on the environmental solutions side of the business, we've been intentionally a little bit slow on that this year because the team is doing a lot of integration work from an IT standpoint. And again, it's very analogous to recycling and waste. We create value in that space because we've got well-run systems, highly integrated, and we can take a smaller company and layer that operationally right into our density and just draft right off of our systems. Until we get that on the environmental solutions side, you're just adding to your complexities, you're not getting that synergy. And so you'll see us, again, that pipeline is building, you'll see us be much more active next year in the space. I think it's consistent, which is there's variation in deals that may be of a little lower quality from our perspective. I think the high quality deals, right, you're going to pay certainly a higher multiple for. But then I think we've done -- got a good example of that with the US Ecology acquisition. If you buy something quality and you've got a plan against it, you can certainly drive value post-acquisition. Yeah, strongly -- we're still in the growth mode in that business, right? And so we're -- recycling and waste is a very mature business and we could kind of give you a really clear and clean outlook, right? There's going to be a little more up and down in this business as we grow and build it out and part of that is on the customer side. On one hand we are churning out customers on one end of the business who weren't willing to pay returns and -- to beat our returns and we're going to put upward pressure on industry pricing as we always do. And on the flip side, we're layering cross-sell opportunities that we've talked about. And so those don't all come in kind of ratably month to month. Those come in kind of in different timing and waves. So really pleased with the progress. I'd encourage you on that business, if you're measuring it by the quarter, right, you're probably not going to get the best signal quarter to quarter if that's over the next one to two years certainly. Measuring it over the year, I think, gives you a much better view of the trajectory and we're really pleased on both the top line and certainly bottom line performance of that business. I'm sorry, do we expect organic growth for the balance of the year? Yes, yeah, we are. And if you know that business and nature of it, because it's so mix sensitive, there isn't a very clear kind of unit versus price, the kind of pair apart or peel apart volume versus price like we do in recycling and waste. And it hasn't been for lack of trying, but there's just too many variables that don't allow us to do that, but underlying organic unit growth will be there. Well, I'd say the good news is, from an ongoing standpoint, right, we had a bigger broker business a decade ago, and we made a very clear choice that we believe customers are people who generate recycling waste, and we want to have direct relationships with them. So, we're very intentional. What's happened is over the last four or five years, as we've become much more acquisitive, we've seen that portion of the business increase because when we acquire companies, we see that 10% of their book, for example, might be serving brokers. And we don't value $0.01, right, when we pay the purchase price of the deal, because we know that business is going to come out of the system. Typically, we do that over the course of six to maybe even 12 or 18 months honoring contracts in a very ratable fashion, right? In this case, we accelerated it because we felt like with one broker, in particular, we had a receivables risk. And so we took more accelerated action. But there'll always be a small portion of the business that's going to be a drag on our revenue that we're shedding because it's coming in through M&A. Hey, Jerry. No, it's all of the above. It's certainly pricing for the value we're delivering. It is challenging then the mix, right? We make more money in certain, especially in the field services side of the business, you make more money in certain areas and less in others. And then even within some of those categories of in field service challenging each customer account. What isn't really earning their cost of capital and therefore those are things we're pricing or replacing over time and the team's done a great job of that. I'd say as we get our IT systems in place, which Del talked about, that gives us an opportunity to get even more refined and drive even more value from a pricing standpoint. Well, I think Del highlighted earlier, think about recycling of waste 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion a year. We talked about environmental solutions, getting to 25%. Now again, we're reaching there, getting there probably a little quicker than we thought. But again, there'll be some ups and downs in any given quarter. But over the sequence, certainly have line of sight to 25% margin for the year on that category. And then that's not the ending point, right? We'll continue to move. I think in the long term, we would aspire to have EBITDA margins across the two different parts of our business that converge over time, because we think there's that much opportunity and value that's delivered in the environmental solutions space. And again, that's a long-term target on that, but I've given you kind of a marker for kind of what kind of ratable improvement. And we're reticent to kind of choose an individual year because again, that's not how we run the business. We run it forever. Yeah, so service increases continue to exceed decreases. And as I mentioned, for net new business within our open market small container is positive. So if you just take the open market, it would have been modestly positive. I would sit there and say, in the quarter, which was completely offset by what we saw from the broker-related business. Thank you, Nick. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their focus on exceeding customer expectations and commitment to driving value for all of our stakeholders. Have a wonderful rest of the summer and be safe."

            "name": "Brian DelGhiaccio",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Core price on total revenue was 6.8%. Core price on related revenue was 8.1% which included open market pricing of 9.8% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 7.4%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.5% and average yield on related revenue was 6.6%. Second quarter volume on total revenue decreased 80 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1%. Our volume results included a decrease in large container of 3.3%, primarily due to continued softness in construction-related activity, and a decrease in residential of 2.5%, primarily due to municipal contracts lost in 2023, that anniversary in the fourth quarter of this year. During the quarter, small container volume decreased 60 basis points, while landfill MSW increased 1.1%. Small container volume loss is a direct result of intentionally shedding broker-related business obtained through M&A transactions. We continue to adhere to our longstanding strategy of prioritizing direct relationships with our customers. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $173 per ton during the second quarter. This compared to $119 per ton in the prior year. Recycling, processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. Our updated full year guidance assumes commodity prices remain at approximately $170 per ton for the remainder of the year. And now turning to our environmental solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $74 million compared to the prior year fueled by price-led organic growth and contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 40 basis points to total company internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business expanded 130 basis points to 23.8% in the second quarter. Environmental solutions EBITDA margin was 22.5% in the prior year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 31.1%. Margin performance during the quarter included margin expansion in the underlying business of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices. This was partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.15 billion. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures. Year-to-date net capital expenditures of $767 million represents an increase of $234 million or 44% compared to the prior year. Capital spending is more ratable in 2024, whereas \u201823 was heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Prior year capital expenditures were impacted by vendor-related delays in truck and equipment deliveries. Total debt was $13.1 billion, and total liquidity was $3.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.5% during the quarter. We expect a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%. With that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Yeah. And Tyler, good observation. We talked about -- in Q1 we thought that would be our highest level of pricing of this year and then it would sequentially decline in part just because of some of the index-based pricing and just the impact that has throughout the year. As you've seen, though, we've also seen cost moderate, cost inflation moderate, so our spread we've maintained. So we have a similar level of margin expansion in Q1 and Q2. We would expect that spread to decrease a little bit as we move into the second half of the year. But again, if you take a look, driving outsized margin expansion and well above our initial expectations. Yeah, and Tyler, I think our words were that we saw that in the near term, we saw 32% as achievable. Really what we're looking at is the consistent cadence of margin expansion across our business and we talked about that in the 30 to 40 basis point of margin expansion, the recycling waste business a little bit more in the environment solutions, call it, 75 basis points plus just given where it is in its maturity. And so we continue to see that opportunity as we move forward. So we're not going to call what the theoretical cap is, but again, it's about pricing in excess of cost inflation. It's about realizing the benefits from our initiatives, including our digital initiatives, and driving costs out of the system. And we see that runway for years to come. Yeah, no, it's hundreds. So think about putting in the initial infrastructure and getting connected to the grid and then you think about charging stations which become modular once that infrastructure is put in. And so the strategy is we're going a five-year outplan on each of these sites to understand that we'll be layering more vehicles in. And so you're bearing the upfront cost right now and then it's just an incremental cost to put in the charging station as the fleet grows in that space. Thank you. And Noah, just based on when we put in our annual price increase, we didn't see the full impact of that until the second quarter. And so I think that's also reflective of what you're seeing in EBITDA margin performance of that business at the same time. Yeah, let me start with your -- the last part of your question first. I think the shape, you're on the right path there. Maybe a little bit less in Q3 and a little bit more in Q4, but I think the shape, you're directionally correct. Looking at the performance in the underlying business, we saw 120 basis points in recycling waste. We saw actually more than that in the environmental solutions business because for the 130 basis points for the company taken as a whole, remember we had to overcome 80 to 100 basis points of dilution from acquisition we completed in the environmental solutions business in Q4 of \u201823. So, when you take a look at the underlying business within environmental solutions, it was close to 200 basis points. And a point that I'd make there as well is that if you take a look at the volume decline in small container, it was almost exclusively due to these broker-related losses. If you take a look in the open market, we're actually seeing positive unit growth in that business. Yeah, I would say overall we're looking at price in a similar way that we did in the beginning of the year. I would say the spread between price and cost inflation is favorable. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing the better than expected margin expansion. And then I would say the other big piece is really just favorable commodity prices and the flowthrough that has to the bottom line. But an overwhelming majority, again, is going to be in that price-cost spread. Yeah, what I would say, Jerry, is that, again, back to we're not looking at a theoretical cap, we're just looking for that consistent improvement in performance. So our expectations is that just, because again, when you think about some of the things that we can do on the balance sheet as far as improving working capital, being more efficient with the CapEx, start with the, 30 to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion we expect, growing free cash flow conversion a little bit more. Now that said, we've got to overcome things like the expiration of bonus depreciation and some other things that we've had to sit there and overcome that are a little bit outside of our control. So you got to overcome that. From the base business though, you can think of that, call it 50 to 75 basis points of improvement. And then you got to net out the impact of bonus depreciation, which is different by year. Yeah, we'd see being on a common platform, right, on that business, on the environmental solutions business in early \u201825, then we can then iterate the system itself in order to be able to get smarter with respect to the information that we have. So we can be more strategic with respect to pricing, get better as far as productivity, and just become more profitable over time. But right now, we still have a number of systems that we're trying just first to consolidate, then we can continue to enhance and improve the system that we're operating on. Yeah, the pipeline looks good. Keep in mind, we don't operate the business for the quarter. We operate it forever. So we did $800 million of acquisitions in Q4 last year. So there's some natural lumpiness, especially the M&A pipeline. So a little quieter for the first quarter. This year, listen, we could end up at $500 million. We could end up between, $400 million to $500 million or we could end up north of $500 million if other stuff kicks in here. I think we'll be north of $400 million just based on what we have in front of us. And then do we get closer to $500 million or above that, we'll see kind of what happens. Sometimes deals hit you and they're in an accelerated fashion. Most of the time at this point, we're kind of looking at a Q1 and Q2 for close for those transactions. So anything bigger would certainly be at a little bit of a longer timeframe in terms of a close in next year, wouldn't close this year anything more substantial. Yeah, we certainly saw good sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 across maintenance, transportation, labor that -- the cake is already baked on labor for the year, but the comp year-over-year is certainly improving on that. So, as Brian mentioned, that's certainly what's fueling, along with price, our margin expansion. And we seek a continued modulation of that in the second half of the year. So feel really good about the team's execution on cost control. Yeah, so I think, David, I think you're talking about our RISE digital platform. So we said there was $100 million of opportunity. They're cumulative and we've realized about $65 million to date and we would expect to continue to sit there and realize those benefits in future periods, which is embedded in that 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion that we're calling for on a regular cadence, that would certainly be part of that over the next couple years. Sure that's -- sorry, I think [indiscernible] that's an additional $20 million. Now, it's going to be deployed in a phased approach. So we actually just hit our first pilot locations. We're going to be deploying that through the end of 2025. So we really don't expect to get that full run rate benefit until 2026. Yeah. So, again, we've talked about our initiative in order to move to those favorable indices, water sewer trash, garbage trash, and those tend to run higher than CPI. So if you're going back and comparing to five or six years ago, yes, we would expect the restricted portion of our book to perform better than it had historically. But, we've made really good progress and movement against that. So, again, we're close to 60% of that book that was historically linked to CPI now on a favorable index or a fixed rate increase. So that's already reflected in the numbers that you saw in, or that you're seeing in 2024. But certainly, yes, we would expect to be better than where we were historically. Yeah, so it's, call it, 25 to 30 with the balance all being in the underlying business. Our sensitivity hasn't changed that much just because we haven't added that much to the portfolio. It will certainly -- that sensitivity will increase over time as more projects come online. But right now, if you think about just rough math, a $0.10 change in RIN prices is approximately $1 million of operating income annual for us. Yeah we don't really have a target on the acquisition number. And so we kind of give you a rough guide because it's helpful, I think, for your modeling purposes. But as we think about opportunities, right, we want to buy companies that can first fit our strategic filter. We think we're the natural owner there and we can create value for our customers and then the financial filter, which is -- are we going to exceed our cost of capital and create economic profit for our shareholders. Those are the two things we look at. And so we're not opportunity -- we're not capital constrained in that respect. And so [to the extent] (ph) we find those opportunities, we're going to go do that. So, we've spent as much as $3 billion in a given year, and this year is going to be a little more muted, obviously, partly, again, for the internal constraint of we want to make sure that we can digest and execute what we buy over time. So we'll give you an update as we go get into 2025 what we think the outlook is, but it's going to be more of a year-to-year look than some longer-term outlook of what we're going to spend. Well, I'd say if you think about we're at, right, kind of our benchmark level, if you think about any normal run of period. Now, if you take a very short look, like, April and May of 2020, after COVID hit, right, it dropped near zero because everyone was just trying to hold on and figure out what's happening in the world. But if you think about any longer run across a set of quarters, we're certainly at our best performance and we're not stopping. We think there's further opportunity for improvement. Obviously, the rate of improvement will slow. Zero is never the right answer in this category, but we think we can get better."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions, while enhancing profitability across the enterprise. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 8%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 12%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 120 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 and produced $535 million of adjusted free cash flow. The results we delivered are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities.  \n Regarding customer zeal, our efforts to provide best-in-class essential services and sustainability offerings continue to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94%, and we continue to see favorable trends in our net promoter score as customers value our broad service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Strong organic revenue growth during the first quarter was underpinned by core price on related revenue of 8.5% and average yield on related revenue of 7.3%.  \n This level of pricing exceeded our internal cost inflation and resulted in over 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on related revenue declined 1.1%. Large-container and disposal volumes were negatively impacted by severe weather across most of our geographies during the first quarter. Most of the weather impact occurred in January, and we saw a notable rebound in volume performance in February and March as weather conditions normalized.  \n Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhance warranty recovery.  \n We expect to begin deploying the new system later this year using a phased approach, which we estimate will result in $20 million of annual cost savings by 2026. We continue to benefit from advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfilled containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology will reduce contamination in our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million incremental annual revenue. To date, we have already achieved $30 million of annual benefit. \n Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remains on track. Our Las Vegas polymer center is operational and delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners began in March. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis polymer center with equipment installation planned to begin in June. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility.  \n The renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the first quarter, and we expect at least 7 additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 15 collection vehicles in operations. We expect to have more than 50 additional EVs to be added to our fleet in 2024.  \n We now have 7 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure. Development of 40 additional locations is underway with more than 10 new sites expected to be completed in 2024. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve. Employee turnover continues to improve with our first quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year.  \n As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies List and Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. \n With respect to capital allocation, we invested $41 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both the recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Additionally, we returned $168 million to shareholders through dividends in the first quarter. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%. Core price on related revenue was 8.5%, which included open market pricing of 10.2% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small-container of 12.2%, large-container of 7.7% and residential of 8.1%. Average yield on total revenue was 6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.3%.  \n First quarter volume on total revenue decreased 90 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1.1%. The components of our volume performance included a decrease in large-container of 4.4%, primarily due to severe weather in January, along with continued softness in construction-related activity, and a decrease in residential of 2.6%. During the quarter, landfill MSW volume was up 1.6% and small-container volume increased 30 basis points.  \n Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $153 per ton during the first quarter. This compared to $105 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 40 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are exceeding our initial expectations as current commodity prices are approximately $160 per ton.  \n Now turning to our environmental solutions business. First quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $15 million compared to the prior year. The growth was due to the rollover impact from an acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business was 20.5%, which compared to 21% in the prior year. After considering the dilutive impact from a recent acquisition of 110 basis points, EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business increased 60 basis points.  \n Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter expanded 120 basis points to 30.2%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions.  \n Adjusted free cash flow was $535 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 45.9%. Total debt was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments and renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.4% during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We also received a $12 million state grant associated with renewable energy investment. This benefit was recorded in other income and added $0.03 of EPS. This did not impact EBITDA or EBITDA margin during the quarter. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Adam on for Jerry today. So your first polymer center recently opened. Just wondering how that plan is tracking versus your initial expectations. Any surprises there? \nJon Vander Ark: No. It probably opened a month later than we thought all around related permitting and infrastructure issues. The core operations are actually exceeding our expectation.  Shipping to customers, they think it is some of the, if not the, cleanest recycled PET flake in the world. So the facilities, the team are executing really, really well. And again, happy with our equipment providers, happy with everything, and we're up and running in Indianapolis, and we're probably -- should shortly announce our third location on the East Coast. \nUnknown Analyst: Terrific. And then shifting to US Ecology. Just wondering if you can update us on how you're thinking about what level of margin upside is feasible for that business once you fully integrated  the systems, just based on your experience on optimizing route profitability and pricing for your base business. What's the level of margin upside potential there? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're targeting a 25% EBITDA margin there in the midterm and it's really going to be a series of levers, right? We're going to think about customer mix and making sure that we have customers that are willing to pay. We'll obviously think about pricing for the value we deliver on that. We'll drive additional revenue through cross-sell, which we've talked about. And the IT investments help there. They also help us manage the middle, just better labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of disposal, optimizing disposal assets and getting the material into the right spot. And then as we grow, we'll certainly get more leverage on our SG&A. So we've got a series of levers that we think get us to 25% in the midterm. \nOperator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: You mentioned the weakness in volume related to weather. I was hoping that you could give the weather impact in the quarter? \nBrian Delghiaccio: We think, overall, that was about a 50 basis point drag on total volume performance. So you can think about that being down circa 1%. Half of which was weather-related and then just half more in those cyclical volumes as we talked about, construction activity and the like. \nToni Kaplan: Yes. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then just wanted to ask about pricing. Strong core price again this quarter, maybe a little bit above expectation. I think you mentioned it exceeded your expectation as well. I think last quarter, you talked about trajectory of 1Q being the high point, 4Q likely being the low end. Is that still your expectation? And has anything in the inflationary backdrop changed your view on how price plays out or how good price was in the first quarter? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes, I think it modestly exceeded our expectations. And I think that cadence we laid out is still right as we see the -- it will sort of come down. Could we extend that a little higher as the interest rates remain high and I think inflation has been a little stickier than people expected? Yes, I think there's certainly potential for that. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. \nMichael Hoffman: So I guess, one on ES would be the cross-sell. When you bought it, you didn't expect -- you didn't put that into the plan, but it's been proving to be a positive contributor. How do we track against where you -- we are now in that cross-sell? What's that incremental total dollar we picked up? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. I think we're making great progress on that, Michael. Listen, that ES was a little softer in the quarter where certainly, weather impacted them. And they were also coming off a pretty tough comp because we had a great first quarter last year. But that pipeline remains strong. I think we stopped talking about the pipeline at $150 million. That pipeline has grown from there. Now that pipeline is over a couple of years. It builds out as these opportunities develop.  Either the work initiates from a recurring generator or sometimes, it's a project that has a scheduled start that has pushed out a few months. \n So we feel really good about that. And frankly, there's another wave of upside as we get integrated on the IT side and then we get our sales organization kind of optimized against those customer lists and that information. We think there's strong pull-through. I think what's been undeniable for us is that customers want and desire a single-source solution. And this integrated offering is something that we could sell very profitably in the marketplace. \nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then switching gears back to the solid waste business. So that opportunity to capture surcharges and overages through the digital platform, what's the point of conversion of that into a permanent revenue? So you got the -- eventually, a salesperson shows up and says, hey, your container is always overflowing, and you convert it into a permanent upgrade? What's that look like? How do we think about that? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Michael, to your point, the obvious solution to that is to sit there and either get an increased level of service, whether it be the size of the container or just the number of times, the frequency that we're providing that service. But when you take a look just at those incremental revenues, they've been fairly sticky, meaning even though we've had these, because they're not consistent, they tend to be somewhat episodic as well. So again, when we're providing the service based on a certain amount of volume within that container, if there's those overages, we're going to charge for that and same with the contamination. Ultimately, could that change behavior over time? Yes, and we would want that. And at which point then, that probably just results in increased frequency, which positively impacts the top line as well. \nJon Vander Ark: And that is the protocol, right? If somebody's got multiple overages, right, the protocol is it's pushed through Salesforce and the salesperson calls on that customer says, hey, it's time to go from twice a week to 3 times a week or a larger container or whatever the right solution is. To Del's point, I think it's still early days, and we've seen it's across a variety of customers, right? It's not like we're getting all this from the same small set of customers. It's kind of one-sie, two-sie on that front, so it's a little early to tell in terms of what that conversion looks like in the kind of permanent upgrades. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. \nBryan Burgmeier: In the prepared remarks, you touched on a revenue opportunity in recycling. I guess, just what's kind of driving the biggest tailwinds there right now? Is it capturing maybe different materials such as plastic? Are you increasing the throughput speed? And is there any opportunity maybe on the labor side as well? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Well, I think what we talked about, Bryan, on the recycling side a little bit, was on those fees. We were just talking about more on the contamination side. So again, when you take a look at how we're deploying AI into the business, we're doing it on overages, right, on the traditional waste. And then on the recycling, it's more about contamination. So that's what we're talking about there.\n When you just talk about where you saw the uplift in recycling, that was really a function of just the recycled commodity prices and the lift in the overall basket. So our overall basket was $153 per ton in the first quarter. We exited the year at around $130 so that's that uplift, which is really what's driving that increase in recycled commodities. \nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Got it. That makes sense. Yes, I was inquiring about the $60 million opportunity there. And then maybe just on solid waste, like really nice margin performance in 1Q. What are your expectations for cost now versus the start of the year? Based on the public data, maybe wages are cooling a little bit. I'm not sure if that's really accurate for you, guys. And any view on kind of M&R costs? I'll turn it over. \nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yes. I think we're -- the team is executing well in the middle. The outlook is favorable in terms of cost. But on the wage side, that cake is already baked. We give our colleagues all their annual increase at the end of February, right? And even if inflation cools, we don't call them up in September and say, we want some of that back. So that forms -- it's more of a step function in terms of cost. Same thing on third-party transportation. I'd say the most dynamic parts of the cost structure are landfill operating and maintenance. And just on maintenance, again, team is executing well. We're taking more truck deliveries, and that will certainly have a positive aspect as we park some older trucks and replace those with newer trucks. The maintenance cost is obviously substantially lower on those newer trucks, so that should provide a nice benefit toward the second half of the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: Really nice OpEx leverage here as others have alluded to. And at this point, 30 bps margin expansion at midpoint for the full year looks pretty conservative to us, at least in light of 1Q results and the trends. So can you kind of comment on margin expectations and at least how we should be thinking about the typical step-up in margins as we get into the stronger seasonal quarters? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We certainly feel comfortable with how the team is executing in our plan for the rest of the year on that front. And look, for the overall environment, keep in mind, we're in a pretty much a zero-growth volume environment on recycling and waste over the last couple of years, if you think about housing starts and the correlation of that to volume on that front. And certain parts of the economy are a little slower like construction for sure, with interest rates remaining elevated, both commercial and residential construction has been softer on that front. \n Manufacturing has certainly been soft as well. Now there's some certainly positive signs that, that activity is picking up at the plant level, which is encouraging. So we remain pretty confident in our plan, but also mindful of the external environment. Election years, sometimes, special waste volume can push out a little bit on that front. So we'll update you more as we get into the seasonal upswing here after Q2. \nNoah Kaye: Absolutely. I think the spirit of the question is that despite volumes being down more than expected, I mean, margin performance in 1Q was definitely stronger, I think, perhaps, maybe even in your internal forecast, certainly, than the Street. Is there any reason why some of the underlying tailwinds to margins, excluding volumes, shouldn't continue into future quarters? So as you said, you have pretty good visibility on things like labor costs. Is there anything on the cost side of the equation that should give us pause? \nBrian Delghiaccio: No, it's -- to your question, right, we got off to a nice strong start, but it's the first quarter, right? So again, we like to see that continue, that seasonal uptick. We've got some strength right now in recycled commodity prices, but we're 1/4 of the way through. So to your observation, we've gotten us to a really good start to the year, which would suggest there's some modest upside. But we've got to sit there and see it play through the remainder of the year. But we're very pleased with our results in the first quarter. \nNoah Kaye: Yes. Very fair. And then just a quick housekeeping item. The release and your comments mentioned $41 million spend on acquisitions in the period. The line item in the cash flow statement, obviously, well north of that. And I assume that delta is primarily related to the sustainability investments, maybe some renewable energy projects. Can you maybe just help us with that bridge and how to think about full year spending, even excluding the M&A that you hope to do in the balance of the year? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. Most of that is the investments that we're making in those JVs. So we would expect between what we're doing on the landfill gas to energy as well as the investments in Blue Polymers to be about $230 million of investments in those JVs in '24. \nNoah Kaye: Okay, $230 million. And so it sounds like you spent a good chunk of that then already, just doing some quick math here. So that tapers off as we move to the back half? \nBrian Delghiaccio: It does. Yes. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. \nDavid Manthey: Could you provide us with some details on the timing, size and type of acquisition that you did in environmental solutions? It looks like volume growth was about 3.2% this quarter. I'm wondering how much of that was the acquisition. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Well, the acquisition that we completed was in the fourth quarter of '23. So most of what you're seeing there on the environmental solutions side is the rollover impact of a company that we bought out on the West Coast. And we talked about that in our fourth quarter release. But when you think about the total rollover impact right now of acquisitions, so that which closed in '23, together with the deals that closed in the first quarter, it's about 220 basis points of rollover impact to revenue in '24. \nDavid Manthey: Okay. And this enterprise asset management initiative you have, you talked about maintenance productivity and warranty recovery. Could you explain to me what that means and maybe size the opportunity there? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. Well, now you've got a system which is going to be seamlessly integrated. So when you think about the platform that we put on both the financial and the procurement side, now being seamlessly integrated with an asset management system, so our ability to track parts and to be able to sit there and make sure that we're getting warranty recovery on every single part that we take off a truck, greatly enhanced. Right now, it's a very manual exercise in order to sit there and to get those warranty dollars as well as just greater efficiency for the technician. \n So what that means is with that extra time and that capacity that's created, we can in-source more of those repairs. So instead of outsourcing at a multiple, in order to sit there and have those repairs done with a third-party shop, we can do those in-house. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. \nSabahat Khan: Great. Just maybe if we could get a little bit of color on sort of the volume cadence you expect for the rest of the year. A couple of your peers have called out bit of a softer Q2 there. Maybe just your expectation on cadence and if that's changed versus what you might have expected at Q4 reporting a bit earlier. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes, we would expect obviously a sequential improvement from what we saw in Q1 just because we don't -- we're not expecting the weather impact again. Q2, yes, we would expect it to be a little bit negative, given what we're seeing with some of the construction-related activity. We're not seeing a rebound there yet. As we get into the second half of the year, we start to anniversary some of those construction-related declines. So we would expect that to be flat to even potentially slightly positive. \nSabahat Khan: Okay. Great. And then on the PFAS front, you guys have obviously a bit of a unique exposure with the environmental business. Maybe if you look at the puts and the takes across your entire business, obviously, it's a bit early. But just curious how you're sort of approaching that opportunity and kind of the net impact of any additional costs? Just how do you view that entire opportunity given your 2 business lines? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're -- it's a net positive for sure. We talked about kind of $70 million to $90 million last year of PFAS-related revenue. We'll have that number better this year with the pipeline that's building. So we offer a very unique set of products and services to our customers to help them remediate, all the way from the service to multiple opportunities for disposal, solid waste, landfill, obviously. \n For low levels of PFAS [ as these ] landfills, deep well, and that solution is certainly resonating with our customers. But on the other side of the business, that's a multiyear opportunity that's going to play out over time. And there's -- certainly, the size and scale of that opportunity is hard to size yet because it does depend a bit on the regulatory environment. And likewise, on the waste and recycling side, there certainly could be some headwinds there if this thing is poorly executed. I think the industry is doing a good job of pushing back and making sure that we don't get penalized as being a passive receiver. \n And I would say, from a litigation standpoint and more broadly, as regulation increases in the industry, if you think about the last 25, 30 years, we've done a really good job of passing on that cost of regulation and not making that hurt returns. And I think over time, given the nature and complexity, it favors the larger players. So we want regulation to be thoughtful and intelligent. But we see that, again, over time, we're in that [ winter ] through PFAS. \nOperator: The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. \nGeorge Bancroft: Regarding the plastics, maybe just a step up -- climbing to 30,000 feet and just sort of long-term view on it. With these -- with regulations that have been implemented on plastics like the ones that went into effect in Canada, I maybe assume as it goes to Canada or in California, so goes the rest. How do you see those maybe stricter regulations in what can be made and thrown out versus the need to be recycled and the restrictions on that? How does that impact in the long term your polymer centers? And maybe how it -- if it changes producer behavior in what they'll produce? And how does that maybe impact your long-term net return on investment for those facilities? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Listen, consumer packaged goods companies for a long time have talked about minimum content goals. I think when the regulatory environment came online with California and that the other states have followed, that's really what's driven different activity in the marketplace. So we had pretty clear expectations for returns when we built the Las Vegas polymer center. As we always do, we're going to be good stewards of capital, and we've certainly exceeded our expectations there. And I think there's more upward opportunity as we go. We could sell out that facility 5x over. \n And the same will be true in Indianapolis and the other centers. The market is structurally short supplied of recycled PET, and we've got the unique capability of collecting something 5 million times a day, right? And so we can be the anchor tenant of our own facility on that front. So over time, I think we'll think about innovating on collection. So how do we get more PET and more olefins into the system? And then that might spark the opportunity to create a fifth or a sixth polymer center, and we'll take that on as we go. \nOperator: The next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. \nTobey Sommer: A question for you on the hazardous side. How is sort of pipeline and overall demand? And do you think it's sufficient to easily absorb new incinerator capacity coming towards the end of this calendar year? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Pipeline is strong. It's activity, like I said, was certainly weather-related impact in the first quarter. Pipeline is strong. We got a number of attractive things, again, both on recurring streams and some event work in the pipeline. The market is structurally short supplied on incineration. And even with the new capacity coming online, I think it's likely to be tight for the foreseeable future on that front.\n And then you think about any kind of medium to even a bearish case on PFAS is going to push more volume in liquid side into incineration. So we see that, again, market being tight supplied for the foreseeable future. \nTobey Sommer: Appreciate that. And then if I could ask a question on the expense side beyond wages. In terms of hiring, training and the safety events that tend to happen more frequently with new employees, are those other elements around direct compensation also sort of seeing less growth and sort of a benefit to margins this year? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. We're seeing certainly great trucking safety numbers. We talked about turnover. We talked about NPS. And listen, all these things are connected. We've done this a long time, and we know that when you are fully staffed and you've got trained and tenured drivers, they provide great customer service, right? It lowers your risk costs. Those customers are happy with the product offering, and they're willing to pay more and stay longer. So we're certainly seeing some of the benefits of a reduced turnover as well. \nOperator: The next question is from James Schumm with TD Cowen. \nJames Schumm: Just curious if you guys are seeing any trends in the residential business with respect to competition or pricing? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes. Listen, I think that market, we've talked about this at length that's -- over the last decade as the business has improved and transformed in lots of ways, that's one of the parts of the business that hasn't made as much progress. And we have a very strong belief that we need to raise returns in that part of the business. And on balance, I'd say, competitive conduct is improving in terms of people getting a fair return for the work they do. It still has room to improve. And we're going to be disciplined in that space, and we're not going to do work for low returns. And if  a city wants a different provider who might be cheaper but doesn't provide as much benefit, so be it. We're going to put our -- allocate our capital to places where we get a very attractive return. \nJames Schumm: Got it. And then I'm assuming turnover is trending lower, but did you give any specifics there? And what's your target for turnover, if you have one? And apologies if I missed it. \nJon Vander Ark: No problem. We haven't talked about it probably. It's sub-20%. And there's a seasonal curve to turnover, obviously. Again, it goes up in Q2 and Q3, just like volumes do, and comes down in Q4 and Q1. Listen, running the business sub-20%, right, this gets very attractive in terms of all the operating metrics I talked about earlier, including the financial performance of the business. \nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. \nHarold Antor: This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. I guess just on the M&A side, do you expect this year to be above average M&A? We've heard some of your other competitors say, M&A this year may be a little bit more active. And I guess in terms of your verticals, which verticals would you look to see -- would you look to make the biggest gains in M&A? \nJon Vander Ark: Listen, we had a really outsized -- we're coming off $5.5 billion of M&A spend over the last 3 years. There's also -- there's always some episodic nature to that. We closed 2 really big transactions last year in the fourth quarter. And I think last year, there was a $1.8 billion spend. $1.4 billion of it was in recycling and waste, so there's a natural ebb and flow of just when those deals close. And we don't time any of those things around a quarter or a year, right? We do that when the seller is ready to sell on that front. The pipeline remains strong in recycling and waste and environmental solutions. \n The only place, I'd say, we're slightly self-constrained is on the environmental solutions field services side of the business only because we're doing so much IT integration work that we're letting that team get focused there. And again, the pipeline is certainly building, and we could close more opportunities right now. We're pausing until 2025 on that, when we have a really solid foundation to integrate companies into because that's when we think we maximize the synergies of those acquisitions. \nHarold Antor: And I believe that you said recycled commodities are trending at $160 per ton. Is that what you're baking in for 2Q? And if not, I guess, what are you baking in there? And I guess one housekeeping is, what is internal inflation running right now? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. I mean right now, we're just pegging to what we see, which is running right around that $160 per ton. But back to my earlier comment, we want to see that stay for a longer period of time before we sit there and say that, that's where it's going to be for the remainder of the year. \nOperator: The next question is from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. \nMichael Feniger: Just a quick one, I apologize if you already addressed it. But I think EBITDA was a little bit down in environmental solutions or environmental services. Margin was down a little bit. You might have addressed it earlier, but apologies if there was something you would want to call out of why that happened and how we kind of think about how that plays through the full year. \nJon Vander Ark: Sure. Yes. No, most of that is the acquisition we did in the fourth quarter, ACT. And as you know, when we do acquisitions, we always invest heavily in Q1 -- or in the first year rather, the pro forma, to integrate on that front. So that's what's the drag on that. But again, our margin outlook for ES is certainly positive for the year. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. And we would expect that to abate, that margin headwind on the acquisition, and we ultimately expect to see margin expansion in that business on a full year basis. \nMichael Feniger: And would it be probably above what you would expect for the solid waste business? \nBrian Delghiaccio: Well, look, solid waste ran at 120 basis points in our first quarter.  As we say again, we talked about that cadence on environmental solutions moving in that 75 to 100 basis points per year, right? And we see that on a sustained basis in the medium term until we hit that medium-term target of circa 25%. So I think you can think of it in that ZIP code. \nMichael Feniger: And lastly, guys, just to wrap up, Brian, obviously, there's a lot of focus on CPI, either inflation staying sticky, rolling over, moderating. Can you just remind us when we think of CPI, there's obviously the headline CPI. There's what you guys have kind of converted over time. Can you just remind us where we are in that process? That would be helpful. \nBrian Delghiaccio: Yes. So if you just take a look, again, if you look at our entire revenue stream, about 45% of our revenue has some sort of contractual pricing restriction, 55% in the open market. So of that 45% that has that contractual pricing mechanism, 23% is directly linked to CPI, headline CPI. 27% are alternative indices like water, sewer trash, garbage trash. And then the remaining 50% are either a fixed rate increase, some sort of rate review, things of that nature. So we've continued to move, right, the book away from headline CPI to alternative indices, where now we have more on alternative indices than we do on headline. \nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. \nMichael Hoffman: I just wanted to play a little cleanup. So one, to roll off this temporary container business, is it not correct that you would park equipment pretty quickly, reposition drivers, raise price? So while this may show up as a volume calculation, it's not that big of an impact to profitability because you can pivot so quickly? \nJon Vander Ark: Yes, certainly, Michael. I mean, we're dynamic in that in the market. And if you look at the quarter, volume was down 10.8%, but price was up 7.1%. And I just think that speaks to the strength of the execution, frankly, that strength of the industry, right, in an environment where volume is declining. If you go back a decade or 2, you might see behavior change and pricing be flat or even pricing go negative. And I think people understand the value of the products and services they're delivering. And the ability to flex and scale in that business is quicker than almost any and certainly, our team has done a great job of that. \nMichael Hoffman: And then the other would be -- well, the incineration comment, I concur with. This will remain tight for a while. US Ecology was predominantly an inorganic chemistry play on the disposal side and the incineration world is predominantly organic, so it's less impactful to you anyway. It's not that you don't have any organics, but you're much more of an inorganic play. \nJon Vander Ark: Historically, that was true, Michael. But as we provide, again, a broader set of products and services, we certainly expanded the offering, right? And we're a significant player in that place, in that space in terms of liquids because we're going to recurring revenue generators and handling 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 products in their facilities. And it can certainly be on the organic and inorganic side. \nMichael Hoffman: Right. Okay. But the disposal -- landfill disposal side is still predominantly in inorganic. So this is the fuel blending and liquids side is getting you into the organics. \nJon Vander Ark: Correct. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. \nJon Vander Ark: Thank you, MJ. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their efforts and commitment to driving lasting value for all of our stakeholders. I'd also like to make a special acknowledgment to Michael Hoffman, a senior statesmen on the call. He's been with the industry for decades. And as he's announced, he's starting a new chapter, certainly supporting the industry in a different capacity. But over the last number of decades, he's certainly seen a lot of transformation in the industry and has handled this environment and this community with a lot of excellence and professionalism. So congratulations, Michael, in your next chapter. Have a good evening, everyone, and be safe. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Vander Ark",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions, while enhancing profitability across the enterprise. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 8%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 12%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 120 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 and produced $535 million of adjusted free cash flow. The results we delivered are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities.  \n Regarding customer zeal, our efforts to provide best-in-class essential services and sustainability offerings continue to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94%, and we continue to see favorable trends in our net promoter score as customers value our broad service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Strong organic revenue growth during the first quarter was underpinned by core price on related revenue of 8.5% and average yield on related revenue of 7.3%.  \n This level of pricing exceeded our internal cost inflation and resulted in over 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on related revenue declined 1.1%. Large-container and disposal volumes were negatively impacted by severe weather across most of our geographies during the first quarter. Most of the weather impact occurred in January, and we saw a notable rebound in volume performance in February and March as weather conditions normalized.  \n Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhance warranty recovery.  \n We expect to begin deploying the new system later this year using a phased approach, which we estimate will result in $20 million of annual cost savings by 2026. We continue to benefit from advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfilled containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology will reduce contamination in our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million incremental annual revenue. To date, we have already achieved $30 million of annual benefit. \n Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remains on track. Our Las Vegas polymer center is operational and delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners began in March. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis polymer center with equipment installation planned to begin in June. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility.  \n The renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the first quarter, and we expect at least 7 additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 15 collection vehicles in operations. We expect to have more than 50 additional EVs to be added to our fleet in 2024.  \n We now have 7 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure. Development of 40 additional locations is underway with more than 10 new sites expected to be completed in 2024. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve. Employee turnover continues to improve with our first quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year.  \n As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies List and Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. \n With respect to capital allocation, we invested $41 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both the recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Additionally, we returned $168 million to shareholders through dividends in the first quarter. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. No. It probably opened a month later than we thought all around related permitting and infrastructure issues. The core operations are actually exceeding our expectation.  Shipping to customers, they think it is some of the, if not the, cleanest recycled PET flake in the world. So the facilities, the team are executing really, really well. And again, happy with our equipment providers, happy with everything, and we're up and running in Indianapolis, and we're probably -- should shortly announce our third location on the East Coast. Yes. We're targeting a 25% EBITDA margin there in the midterm and it's really going to be a series of levers, right? We're going to think about customer mix and making sure that we have customers that are willing to pay. We'll obviously think about pricing for the value we deliver on that. We'll drive additional revenue through cross-sell, which we've talked about. And the IT investments help there. They also help us manage the middle, just better labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of disposal, optimizing disposal assets and getting the material into the right spot. And then as we grow, we'll certainly get more leverage on our SG&A. So we've got a series of levers that we think get us to 25% in the midterm. Yes, I think it modestly exceeded our expectations. And I think that cadence we laid out is still right as we see the -- it will sort of come down. Could we extend that a little higher as the interest rates remain high and I think inflation has been a little stickier than people expected? Yes, I think there's certainly potential for that. Yes. I think we're making great progress on that, Michael. Listen, that ES was a little softer in the quarter where certainly, weather impacted them. And they were also coming off a pretty tough comp because we had a great first quarter last year. But that pipeline remains strong. I think we stopped talking about the pipeline at $150 million. That pipeline has grown from there. Now that pipeline is over a couple of years. It builds out as these opportunities develop.  Either the work initiates from a recurring generator or sometimes, it's a project that has a scheduled start that has pushed out a few months. \n So we feel really good about that. And frankly, there's another wave of upside as we get integrated on the IT side and then we get our sales organization kind of optimized against those customer lists and that information. We think there's strong pull-through. I think what's been undeniable for us is that customers want and desire a single-source solution. And this integrated offering is something that we could sell very profitably in the marketplace. And that is the protocol, right? If somebody's got multiple overages, right, the protocol is it's pushed through Salesforce and the salesperson calls on that customer says, hey, it's time to go from twice a week to 3 times a week or a larger container or whatever the right solution is. To Del's point, I think it's still early days, and we've seen it's across a variety of customers, right? It's not like we're getting all this from the same small set of customers. It's kind of one-sie, two-sie on that front, so it's a little early to tell in terms of what that conversion looks like in the kind of permanent upgrades. Sure. Yes. I think we're -- the team is executing well in the middle. The outlook is favorable in terms of cost. But on the wage side, that cake is already baked. We give our colleagues all their annual increase at the end of February, right? And even if inflation cools, we don't call them up in September and say, we want some of that back. So that forms -- it's more of a step function in terms of cost. Same thing on third-party transportation. I'd say the most dynamic parts of the cost structure are landfill operating and maintenance. And just on maintenance, again, team is executing well. We're taking more truck deliveries, and that will certainly have a positive aspect as we park some older trucks and replace those with newer trucks. The maintenance cost is obviously substantially lower on those newer trucks, so that should provide a nice benefit toward the second half of the year. Yes. We certainly feel comfortable with how the team is executing in our plan for the rest of the year on that front. And look, for the overall environment, keep in mind, we're in a pretty much a zero-growth volume environment on recycling and waste over the last couple of years, if you think about housing starts and the correlation of that to volume on that front. And certain parts of the economy are a little slower like construction for sure, with interest rates remaining elevated, both commercial and residential construction has been softer on that front. \n Manufacturing has certainly been soft as well. Now there's some certainly positive signs that, that activity is picking up at the plant level, which is encouraging. So we remain pretty confident in our plan, but also mindful of the external environment. Election years, sometimes, special waste volume can push out a little bit on that front. So we'll update you more as we get into the seasonal upswing here after Q2. Yes. We're -- it's a net positive for sure. We talked about kind of $70 million to $90 million last year of PFAS-related revenue. We'll have that number better this year with the pipeline that's building. So we offer a very unique set of products and services to our customers to help them remediate, all the way from the service to multiple opportunities for disposal, solid waste, landfill, obviously. \n For low levels of PFAS [ as these ] landfills, deep well, and that solution is certainly resonating with our customers. But on the other side of the business, that's a multiyear opportunity that's going to play out over time. And there's -- certainly, the size and scale of that opportunity is hard to size yet because it does depend a bit on the regulatory environment. And likewise, on the waste and recycling side, there certainly could be some headwinds there if this thing is poorly executed. I think the industry is doing a good job of pushing back and making sure that we don't get penalized as being a passive receiver. \n And I would say, from a litigation standpoint and more broadly, as regulation increases in the industry, if you think about the last 25, 30 years, we've done a really good job of passing on that cost of regulation and not making that hurt returns. And I think over time, given the nature and complexity, it favors the larger players. So we want regulation to be thoughtful and intelligent. But we see that, again, over time, we're in that [ winter ] through PFAS. Yes. Listen, consumer packaged goods companies for a long time have talked about minimum content goals. I think when the regulatory environment came online with California and that the other states have followed, that's really what's driven different activity in the marketplace. So we had pretty clear expectations for returns when we built the Las Vegas polymer center. As we always do, we're going to be good stewards of capital, and we've certainly exceeded our expectations there. And I think there's more upward opportunity as we go. We could sell out that facility 5x over. \n And the same will be true in Indianapolis and the other centers. The market is structurally short supplied of recycled PET, and we've got the unique capability of collecting something 5 million times a day, right? And so we can be the anchor tenant of our own facility on that front. So over time, I think we'll think about innovating on collection. So how do we get more PET and more olefins into the system? And then that might spark the opportunity to create a fifth or a sixth polymer center, and we'll take that on as we go. Yes. Pipeline is strong. It's activity, like I said, was certainly weather-related impact in the first quarter. Pipeline is strong. We got a number of attractive things, again, both on recurring streams and some event work in the pipeline. The market is structurally short supplied on incineration. And even with the new capacity coming online, I think it's likely to be tight for the foreseeable future on that front.\n And then you think about any kind of medium to even a bearish case on PFAS is going to push more volume in liquid side into incineration. So we see that, again, market being tight supplied for the foreseeable future. Yes. We're seeing certainly great trucking safety numbers. We talked about turnover. We talked about NPS. And listen, all these things are connected. We've done this a long time, and we know that when you are fully staffed and you've got trained and tenured drivers, they provide great customer service, right? It lowers your risk costs. Those customers are happy with the product offering, and they're willing to pay more and stay longer. So we're certainly seeing some of the benefits of a reduced turnover as well. Yes. Listen, I think that market, we've talked about this at length that's -- over the last decade as the business has improved and transformed in lots of ways, that's one of the parts of the business that hasn't made as much progress. And we have a very strong belief that we need to raise returns in that part of the business. And on balance, I'd say, competitive conduct is improving in terms of people getting a fair return for the work they do. It still has room to improve. And we're going to be disciplined in that space, and we're not going to do work for low returns. And if  a city wants a different provider who might be cheaper but doesn't provide as much benefit, so be it. We're going to put our -- allocate our capital to places where we get a very attractive return. No problem. We haven't talked about it probably. It's sub-20%. And there's a seasonal curve to turnover, obviously. Again, it goes up in Q2 and Q3, just like volumes do, and comes down in Q4 and Q1. Listen, running the business sub-20%, right, this gets very attractive in terms of all the operating metrics I talked about earlier, including the financial performance of the business. Listen, we had a really outsized -- we're coming off $5.5 billion of M&A spend over the last 3 years. There's also -- there's always some episodic nature to that. We closed 2 really big transactions last year in the fourth quarter. And I think last year, there was a $1.8 billion spend. $1.4 billion of it was in recycling and waste, so there's a natural ebb and flow of just when those deals close. And we don't time any of those things around a quarter or a year, right? We do that when the seller is ready to sell on that front. The pipeline remains strong in recycling and waste and environmental solutions. \n The only place, I'd say, we're slightly self-constrained is on the environmental solutions field services side of the business only because we're doing so much IT integration work that we're letting that team get focused there. And again, the pipeline is certainly building, and we could close more opportunities right now. We're pausing until 2025 on that, when we have a really solid foundation to integrate companies into because that's when we think we maximize the synergies of those acquisitions. Sure. Yes. No, most of that is the acquisition we did in the fourth quarter, ACT. And as you know, when we do acquisitions, we always invest heavily in Q1 -- or in the first year rather, the pro forma, to integrate on that front. So that's what's the drag on that. But again, our margin outlook for ES is certainly positive for the year. Yes, certainly, Michael. I mean, we're dynamic in that in the market. And if you look at the quarter, volume was down 10.8%, but price was up 7.1%. And I just think that speaks to the strength of the execution, frankly, that strength of the industry, right, in an environment where volume is declining. If you go back a decade or 2, you might see behavior change and pricing be flat or even pricing go negative. And I think people understand the value of the products and services they're delivering. And the ability to flex and scale in that business is quicker than almost any and certainly, our team has done a great job of that. Historically, that was true, Michael. But as we provide, again, a broader set of products and services, we certainly expanded the offering, right? And we're a significant player in that place, in that space in terms of liquids because we're going to recurring revenue generators and handling 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 products in their facilities. And it can certainly be on the organic and inorganic side. Correct. Thank you, MJ. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their efforts and commitment to driving lasting value for all of our stakeholders. I'd also like to make a special acknowledgment to Michael Hoffman, a senior statesmen on the call. He's been with the industry for decades. And as he's announced, he's starting a new chapter, certainly supporting the industry in a different capacity. But over the last number of decades, he's certainly seen a lot of transformation in the industry and has handled this environment and this community with a lot of excellence and professionalism. So congratulations, Michael, in your next chapter. Have a good evening, everyone, and be safe."

            "name": "Brian Delghiaccio",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%. Core price on related revenue was 8.5%, which included open market pricing of 10.2% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small-container of 12.2%, large-container of 7.7% and residential of 8.1%. Average yield on total revenue was 6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.3%.  \n First quarter volume on total revenue decreased 90 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1.1%. The components of our volume performance included a decrease in large-container of 4.4%, primarily due to severe weather in January, along with continued softness in construction-related activity, and a decrease in residential of 2.6%. During the quarter, landfill MSW volume was up 1.6% and small-container volume increased 30 basis points.  \n Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $153 per ton during the first quarter. This compared to $105 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 40 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are exceeding our initial expectations as current commodity prices are approximately $160 per ton.  \n Now turning to our environmental solutions business. First quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $15 million compared to the prior year. The growth was due to the rollover impact from an acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business was 20.5%, which compared to 21% in the prior year. After considering the dilutive impact from a recent acquisition of 110 basis points, EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business increased 60 basis points.  \n Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter expanded 120 basis points to 30.2%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions.  \n Adjusted free cash flow was $535 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 45.9%. Total debt was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments and renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.4% during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We also received a $12 million state grant associated with renewable energy investment. This benefit was recorded in other income and added $0.03 of EPS. This did not impact EBITDA or EBITDA margin during the quarter. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. We think, overall, that was about a 50 basis point drag on total volume performance. So you can think about that being down circa 1%. Half of which was weather-related and then just half more in those cyclical volumes as we talked about, construction activity and the like. Michael, to your point, the obvious solution to that is to sit there and either get an increased level of service, whether it be the size of the container or just the number of times, the frequency that we're providing that service. But when you take a look just at those incremental revenues, they've been fairly sticky, meaning even though we've had these, because they're not consistent, they tend to be somewhat episodic as well. So again, when we're providing the service based on a certain amount of volume within that container, if there's those overages, we're going to charge for that and same with the contamination. Ultimately, could that change behavior over time? Yes, and we would want that. And at which point then, that probably just results in increased frequency, which positively impacts the top line as well. Well, I think what we talked about, Bryan, on the recycling side a little bit, was on those fees. We were just talking about more on the contamination side. So again, when you take a look at how we're deploying AI into the business, we're doing it on overages, right, on the traditional waste. And then on the recycling, it's more about contamination. So that's what we're talking about there.\n When you just talk about where you saw the uplift in recycling, that was really a function of just the recycled commodity prices and the lift in the overall basket. So our overall basket was $153 per ton in the first quarter. We exited the year at around $130 so that's that uplift, which is really what's driving that increase in recycled commodities. No, it's -- to your question, right, we got off to a nice strong start, but it's the first quarter, right? So again, we like to see that continue, that seasonal uptick. We've got some strength right now in recycled commodity prices, but we're 1/4 of the way through. So to your observation, we've gotten us to a really good start to the year, which would suggest there's some modest upside. But we've got to sit there and see it play through the remainder of the year. But we're very pleased with our results in the first quarter. Yes. Most of that is the investments that we're making in those JVs. So we would expect between what we're doing on the landfill gas to energy as well as the investments in Blue Polymers to be about $230 million of investments in those JVs in '24. It does. Yes. Well, the acquisition that we completed was in the fourth quarter of '23. So most of what you're seeing there on the environmental solutions side is the rollover impact of a company that we bought out on the West Coast. And we talked about that in our fourth quarter release. But when you think about the total rollover impact right now of acquisitions, so that which closed in '23, together with the deals that closed in the first quarter, it's about 220 basis points of rollover impact to revenue in '24. Yes. Well, now you've got a system which is going to be seamlessly integrated. So when you think about the platform that we put on both the financial and the procurement side, now being seamlessly integrated with an asset management system, so our ability to track parts and to be able to sit there and make sure that we're getting warranty recovery on every single part that we take off a truck, greatly enhanced. Right now, it's a very manual exercise in order to sit there and to get those warranty dollars as well as just greater efficiency for the technician. \n So what that means is with that extra time and that capacity that's created, we can in-source more of those repairs. So instead of outsourcing at a multiple, in order to sit there and have those repairs done with a third-party shop, we can do those in-house. Yes, we would expect obviously a sequential improvement from what we saw in Q1 just because we don't -- we're not expecting the weather impact again. Q2, yes, we would expect it to be a little bit negative, given what we're seeing with some of the construction-related activity. We're not seeing a rebound there yet. As we get into the second half of the year, we start to anniversary some of those construction-related declines. So we would expect that to be flat to even potentially slightly positive. Yes. I mean right now, we're just pegging to what we see, which is running right around that $160 per ton. But back to my earlier comment, we want to see that stay for a longer period of time before we sit there and say that, that's where it's going to be for the remainder of the year. Yes. And we would expect that to abate, that margin headwind on the acquisition, and we ultimately expect to see margin expansion in that business on a full year basis. Well, look, solid waste ran at 120 basis points in our first quarter.  As we say again, we talked about that cadence on environmental solutions moving in that 75 to 100 basis points per year, right? And we see that on a sustained basis in the medium term until we hit that medium-term target of circa 25%. So I think you can think of it in that ZIP code. Yes. So if you just take a look, again, if you look at our entire revenue stream, about 45% of our revenue has some sort of contractual pricing restriction, 55% in the open market. So of that 45% that has that contractual pricing mechanism, 23% is directly linked to CPI, headline CPI. 27% are alternative indices like water, sewer trash, garbage trash. And then the remaining 50% are either a fixed rate increase, some sort of rate review, things of that nature. So we've continued to move, right, the book away from headline CPI to alternative indices, where now we have more on alternative indices than we do on headline."
