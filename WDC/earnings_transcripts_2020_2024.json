[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nT. Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. \n Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. \n We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to David. \nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy and safe. \n As I reflect on my first full quarter as CEO of Western Digital, I am extremely proud of the way our team has navigated the complexities and uncertainties inherent in this unprecedented environment. As a company, we continue to adapt to provide continuity and high-quality products for our customers, deliver value to our shareholders and, importantly, prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We have a unique view into many drivers and trends that play both domestically and internationally due to the breadth of our portfolio of innovative flash and hard drive solutions going into cloud, OEM channel and retail end markets. We look at our business holistically, but it is especially important now to understand the nuances, challenges and opportunities in each market we serve. \n So before we dig into the results for the quarter and full year, I want to talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro trends are impacting the business. I'll then update you on how we are thinking about our strategic priorities for the fiscal year 2021, before turning it over to Bob for a financial update, which will be followed by Q&A. \n Western Digital has successfully managed through this unpredictable time with limited business impact from the pandemic. We made important investments and changes to minimize manufacturing and logistical challenges that were primarily impacting our hard drive business. Bob will discuss the financial impact of these later in the call. And we have maintained our focus on delivering for customers throughout. \n From an end market standpoint, demand was mixed in the quarter. And if there's a common theme among our end markets, it's uncertainty. In the second half of fiscal 2020, customers were focused on ensuring they had enough supply to meet heightened demand. As expected, demand in our cloud business was strong due to the work-from-home trend. At the same time, healthy demand for our flash-based notebook solutions drove record revenue in our OEM end market. Finally, in retail, while we have a robust distribution channel with over 350,000 points of purchase around the world and well-established brands, we were impacted by COVID-related lockdowns at many of our brick-and-mortar customers. We did see the business recover as the quarter progressed due to easing of lockdowns and the transition to online buying with curbside pickup. \n As we look to the first half of fiscal 2020, one, uncertainty remains. We remain vigilant given the resurgence of the virus and its potential to disrupt our supply chain, including our ability to keep full teams working in our manufacturing facilities. Apart from COVID-19, we're managing through other macro trends. The global economic contraction is generally -- is generating an uncertain demand environment, and we are closely monitoring trade-related geopolitical developments, which are pertinent to a global business like ours. These near-term headwinds will eventually subside, and we are confident that the strength of our portfolio and strong customer relationships are well aligned to where the growth is, in the cloud and on the edge. We've continued to make strategic technology and product investments in both flash and hard drives to drive long-term revenue growth and gross margin expansion. \n Now turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, results were generally in line with our guidance. We achieved this while partially offsetting higher-than-anticipated COVID-19-related costs, which Bob will discuss in more detail. We reported revenue of $4.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, mainly driven by growth in the cloud and record results for our client SSD portfolio for notebooks. \n Looking back at the full fiscal year 2020, I am pleased with our performance. Our end market diversity and breadth, broad customer base, channel reach and innovative leadership all positioned Western Digital to benefit from the multiyear growth in data creation and storage. For fiscal 2020, revenue totaled $16.7 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.04. We continue to align our portfolio with a sharp focus on growth and margin improvement. \n Importantly, over the last year, we brought to market several exciting new innovations across both flash and hard drives that I'd like to touch upon. \n Starting with flash. As you know, we believe flash is the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital and is an area where we've already had a tremendous foundation with consumer cards, USB drives and client and enterprise SSDs. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, the migration to flash within game consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support a new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that underpins a multiyear growth opportunity. \n To capitalize on this opportunity, we launched BiCS5, our 112-layer flash product in retail last quarter, which delivers exceptional capacity, performance and reliability, all at an attractive cost. The ramp has gone very well with impressive yields, and we are just at the beginning stages of this product ramp. While we focus on ramping BiCS5, BiCS4 has continued to provide the right balance of performance and cost reduction. BiCS4 represented over 60% of bits shipped in the quarter. \n Earlier this year, we celebrated the first production wafer shipment from our K1 fab, our new manufacturing facility for 3D BiCS flash memory. This is another important milestone reflecting the successful 20-year partnership we've had with Kioxia. Another major highlight has been the ramp of our enterprise SSD product line. Enterprise SSD revenue in the quarter grew nearly 70% sequentially, and our revenue share increased to the low double digits. This will remain an important area of focus within our flash portfolio. \n Now turning to hard drives. We continue to lead the industry in aerial density using innovations across the entire drive, algorithms, firmware, mechanical heads and media. We were the first in the industry to ship energy-assisted drives for mass production and expect a strong ramp into the fiscal second quarter and beyond. In short, we are going through important product transitions in both our flash and HDD businesses that we think set up Western Digital well for the future. \n Recognizing that these are uncertain times, we believe that the most important thing we can do is keep our foot on the proverbial innovation pedal and execute on the road map across the business. We have an extremely talented team working on new products that will continue to drive leadership in flash and hard drives. \n Looking ahead, our strategic priorities are centered around driving innovation for customers and value for shareholders. First and foremost, we will focus on driving long-term shareholder value as we bolster our flash and HDD portfolios, including ramping 2 important product lines to high volume, our SSD products and our energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives. Secondly, we will accelerate our transition to BiCS5, delivering additional performance for our customers and notable cost advantages for Western Digital. Third, we will continue to sharpen our execution from a product road map and strategic business objectives. And finally, we are evolving our portfolio to drive growth, margin improvement and cash generation while also paying down debt and investing in the future. In the near term, we expect to remain challenged by the pandemic and the global economic contraction. Internally, we're also navigating multiple substantial product transitions, which will require sharp execution focus. But we are very confident they will set us up well for the long term. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to share our financial highlights and outlook. \nRobert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a challenging global economy that has continued to impact Western Digital's performance, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty that both we and our customers are facing. While this uncertainty isn't going away in the near term, we'll continue to adapt, and we believe Western Digital is well positioned for the future. \n With that, I'll walk you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 18% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.7 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2019, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.04. \n Looking at end market. Client Devices revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5% on a sequential basis and up 19% year-over-year. Within this end market, our robust family of client SSDs, which are ideally suited for remote learning and work-from-home applications, achieved another record quarter of revenue. Notebook and desktop-related hard drive revenue declined slightly sequentially as the market continued to transition to SSD-based products. Smart video was weaker than our expectations due to continued headwinds associated with the pandemic. In gaming, we began shipping our flash solutions for the upcoming new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue was down sequentially, but up year-over-year off a low base. \n Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, revenue of $6.2 billion was up 24% from fiscal year 2019. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was down slightly on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew nearly 70% sequentially and more than doubled from a year ago. \n Next, Client Solutions revenue was $687 million, down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Despite this, we were encouraged to see demand pick up in June as countries began to ease lockdown restrictions and as brick-and-mortar locations shifted more of their operations online. This strength continued into July. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we executed very well in this business in a difficult environment. With over 350,000 points of purchase around the world, we continue to have incredibly strong distribution breadth and brand recognition. \n Turning to revenue by product category. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 49% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 1% sequentially on a blended basis and up 3% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Total exabyte shipments were down 2%. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 2% to $87 as mix continued to shift to the cloud. \n As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 1 percentage point sequentially to 28.9%, slightly below our guidance range. The major item that impacted our gross margin was COVID-19-related costs of $96 million. This almost exclusively impacted hard drives -- the hard drive business and was primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics costs. For clarity, this item was included in our non-GAAP gross margin. \n Our flash gross margin was 30.5%, up 4 percentage points from last quarter due to cost reductions and slightly favorable pricing. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The biggest driver of the lower gross margin was the $96 million in COVID-19-related costs, representing a 4.7 percentage point impact on our hard drive gross margin. \n Operating expenses were $713 million, well below our guidance range, primarily due to our decision to cap variable compensation expense given the current economic environment. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $172 million, and free cash flow was $261 million. In fiscal 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. \n Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $89 million due to the timing of funds flowing to and from the joint ventures. In the fourth quarter, we distributed $150 million in dividends to our shareholders, which was our final distribution prior to suspending the dividend. We also made a standard $63 million debt repayment in the fourth quarter. I would note that we have already made an optional debt repayment of $150 million in July. \n Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.7 billion. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.2x in the fourth quarter. And our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.8x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes an approximate $1 billion in depreciation add back associated with the joint ventures, which is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. \n Moving on to guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We are somewhat challenged in the near term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic and being in the midst of a global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and focus on our great products, deep customer relationships and large and growing markets. We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long term. \n We expect revenue in the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of $3.70 billion to $3.9 billion. Growth in Client Solutions is expected to be more than offset by a decline in both Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Devices. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25% and 27%. This range includes approximately $80 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. This should be the peak quarter in fiscal 2021 for K1 period expenses. We expect operating expenses to be between $700 million and $720 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $70 million and $80 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 26% in Q1 and for the full fiscal year of 2021. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.65 in Q1, assuming approximately 304 million fully diluted shares. \n Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of the joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures. We will continue to monitor capital expenditures very closely given the current business environment. \n In summary, we are executing well in a challenging environment, and results are generally in line with our expectations. We are taking decisive steps to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment while ensuring we focus our resources to address the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead. \n I'll now turn it back over to Dave. \nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. While we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment, I am confident that Western Digital can lead the market for years to come. As I've said, I came here because I have a very strong conviction that Western Digital can play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation, and that conviction has only strengthened in the past 5 months. We have deep flash and HDD product portfolio, operational scale and great customer relationships, combined with the ever-growing demand for data creation and storage. \n All in all, it's a great place to be, and I'm extremely thankful for the hard work that our talented global team puts in on a day in and day out basis. We are operating in uncertain times, but Western Digital's strong, consistent performance reflects our ability to maintain our market leadership by delivering technological innovation with the quality, performance and cost effectiveness that our customers rely upon. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nWamsi Mohan: I was hoping you could give us some sense on your 18-terabyte ramp. It appeared that you were expecting that ramp before in the September quarter. It looks like it might have been pushed out further. Can you talk about what's going on there? And I have a follow-up. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. No, it hasn't pushed out. The ramp is on plan, as we've talked about. We plan on producing in excess of 1 million units this quarter. It's a very important quarter for us on that ramp, Wamsi, because it's the quarter where we get the yields up, which gets us the margin profile we need to go into the second quarter of the fiscal year at full production capacity. So it's on track where we want it to be. We feel good about it, and this is going to be an important quarter for us. But it's something we know how to do in ramping a drive platform. \nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And I was wondering if you can maybe bridge this quarter-on-quarter gross margin outlook, what the main puts and takes there are. How much are you thinking that the HDD side is going to contribute given that some of the capacity enterprise weakness was -- capacity enterprise seems like a little bit weaker than what people were thinking. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Bob to make a few comments. And I think if you look at gross margin going forward, there's a number of headwinds. We still have the COVID costs. We don't expect them to be as high next quarter as they were this quarter, but they're still there, the logistics cost, especially. It's just a very dynamic environment there that changes week by week. We've got the ramp of the 18-terabyte drive that we just talked about. So in the beginning phases of that ramp, you're going to -- it's a headwind on gross margin till we get up the ramp. That's why this is such an important quarter for us that we work through that. And as I said, that's on track. And then on flash, we've got an easing pricing environment. So that's going to impact gross margin there. Bob, any -- did I miss anything? \nRobert Eulau: No. I think those are the keys. I mean on the hard drives, obviously, volumes are a little lower. So we'll be amortizing our fixed costs over a smaller volume as we go up the yield ramp on the 18-terabyte drives. Now on the flash side, as Dave said, I mean, we've got some price and mix headwind. And we also -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have costs up a bit on K1, which amounts to about 1 percentage point on the flash side. So it's just we have multiple challenges this quarter. But I think long term, we're going to be really well positioned once we get up these product ramps. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. \nAaron Rakers: Just kind of building off that last question a little bit. I mean when you look at the hard disc drive gross margin at 27.2% and you adjust, looks like -- adjusted ex-COVID, looks like it's close to about 32%. I think it would be helpful just to kind of frame what the expectation is for COVID impact in this quarter. Is it -- probably not as high, but are we still carrying 3 percentage points plus of kind of headwind on gross margin? Just kind of any framework there. And on top of that, what are you seeing in pricing dynamics in nearline right now in the market? \nDavid Goeckeler: So I'll take the second one. Bob can talk a little bit more about the first. The -- all the businesses transacting at 14T, it's a very competitive point in the market. There's no doubt about that. We're at the -- we're kind of at the tail end of one generation, moving to the next one, and that's why getting up the AT&T ramp is so -- 18, 16 ramp is so important for us. And that will position us well and be able to drive accretive margins to the portfolio on that point. But we expect that as we get 18 out there and the conversations with customers, it's a different TCO proposition for our customers. And that leads to more value for both of us. So we're heading to a better spot. I don't know. Bob, do you want to characterize COVID a little bit in this quarter? It's kind of -- it's a little tough because it's so dynamic. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. Yes. It's not going to be as significant as last quarter. And last quarter, we did offset the COVID cost a bit by pricing. But it obviously did not fully offset it. That's a big number. As we look at Q1, we don't think we're going to have the kind of absorption variances that we had last quarter. You may recall in the earnings call in April, I said that we had some challenges on volumes in April. So we already knew we had that headwind last quarter. We don't have that issue this quarter. So I would say the costs will be down, but I don't want to be too specific. We think we've got it covered in the guidance range that we articulated. \nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know there's a lot of discussion around cloud digestion, kind of mixed data points out there. Relative to the 30% implied nearline capacity ship growth this last quarter, what is your current assessment of the demand from a capacity ship standpoint nearline through the back half of this calendar year? Any kind of views on that front? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We feel like we're definitely going into a digestion phase. If we look at -- we're coming off of 3 really strong quarters of exabyte shipment, and the demand signals we're getting are going to be -- are a little bit down for the next quarter or 2. We think that -- I mean, the long-term trend is obviously still good. We're using the cloud more every day. But there's been a lot of product shipped in there in the last couple of quarters. And what we're seeing from them is, they're all not the same, right? We have all of them. So they're all at different points. But when you add it all up, you see next quarter, there's a negative bias on demand there from what we see looking backwards. \nAaron Rakers: So down sequential? Sorry. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. \nKarl Ackerman: I wanted to follow up to Aaron's last question just on exabyte growth. You obviously -- you actually had a pretty strong quarter for exabyte growth within data center this quarter. But it does sound like the outlook is down sequentially, as you just indicated. I was hoping if you could juxtapose what you're seeing across both on-prem and private cloud environments versus public cloud as it relates to, I guess, both your hard drive portfolio but also your enterprise SSD portfolio. That's my first question. \n And for my follow-up, I was hoping you could -- you've obviously been a little bit smaller player in the enterprise SSD market of late, which has enabled some of the significant share gains. And quite frankly, you've completely turned around your technology portfolio within that enterprise SSD market. Is your expectation going forward for September that you should outperform end market demand given some of the share gains you've seen lately? \nDavid Goeckeler: So on the enterprise SSD, you're right. We've done a lot of work to launch a new product in enterprise SSD. We've got a couple of new products. The first one is out, and it's targeted to the cloud providers. The product targeted to the OEMs is yet to ship. So that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So we really are in a big product transition there. So it's hard for me to draw a conclusion to your question about on-prem versus the cloud given enterprise SSD because we're mainly focused on the cloud side right now, working our way through quals and all those kinds of things. Given that the product is new, given that we're going through a lot of qualifications, over a multi-quarter time frame, I expect us to get better and better. It's going to be a little lumpy as we move through that. So if I look at the number of quals going on in the organization, it's across all technologies. We have twice as many quals going on as we had a year ago this time. So that gives you an idea of where -- how the portfolio is refreshing, and we're driving that into the market. \n On the hard drive side, I guess I can talk about the OEMs in the private data center more of just as an overall market. I mean, well, let me save that response for a different time because that's more PC-related. But I don't know if I have a tremendous amount of insight. Bob, I don't know if you do on the hard drive side versus on-prem versus in the cloud, if we could draw any strong conclusions for that. \nRobert Eulau: No. I think we're seeing softness in both areas as we move forward into Q1. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: The first one, on the hard disk drive. One of your competitors had referenced weaker demand trends, especially for client noncompute out of China. And when I just do a back of envelope, if that is what's happening and impacting your client noncompute, it seems to me that your exabyte shipment for that particular segment may have been down by more than 20% on a Q-o-Q basis. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on it. And I have a follow-up. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll elaborate on the general market. I don't know if I can follow the back of your envelope that fast. But look, I think the channel was -- let me talk about the channel in general and smart video as a part of that. That was a real slog this past quarter. I mean the team worked really hard on it. We thought we saw TAM shrinkage there, significant TAM shrinkage of $100 million or so a year throughout the quarter. So it was -- we look at -- to us, that's a good indication of overall demand that's out there, and it was tough and related to that, and we see that going forward kind of a negative bias on that market. So I don't know, Bob, if you have any additional comments on the smart video, in particular. \nRobert Eulau: No. I agree in the short term. If we look over the longer-time horizon, that is going to be another area of growth in the hard drive business. So we really see the capacity in enterprise business and the smart video business growing as we look over multiple years. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean I think this overall theme you're hearing from us, which is as we look at -- I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter, we see some challenges given COVID, given the state of the economy, given all the demand we've seen in the first half and the inventory rationalizations and digestions that are going on. But in all of those markets, we see very good long-term trends. And so it's a question of how fast that comes back. But all of the -- I think the pandemic has shown us the amount that all of us are relying on technology, and I think our portfolio is as well positioned for that world as it has been in some time. \nMehdi Hosseini: Great. And just my follow-up question has to do with your -- the flash. You highlighted the fact that your revenues were up 70% or so. But I heard that commentary suggests there is an unfavorable mix shift into the September quarter. Perhaps you could help us better understand the dynamic if you were to elaborate on the mix of your NAND, how SSD and smartphone application are trending? And it seems to me that maybe the game console is happening later in the year. And if you could elaborate on it, it will be great. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. So I think there are a bunch of pieces in there, Mehdi. So game console is definitely a growth area, and we're very fortunate to be participating in that. And as you know, we haven't been in the hard drive side of that business for quite a while. So it's all upside from our perspective. And then I would say, overall, there may be slight mix changes as we go quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing some pressure in terms of price, and that's factored into our guidance as well. \nT. Peter Andrew: Yes, Mehdi. This is Peter. Also don't forget, we do have a little bit of a step-up in the K1 cost. But as you go Q-to-Q, that will be another pressure on the flash gross margins. \nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. But in terms of the end market and mix as it relates to flash, there is -- you shouldn't assume a significant change? \nRobert Eulau: I think the biggest change is the one I mentioned on game consoles becoming more significant. But otherwise, it will be up and down here and there, but I don't think it'll be that material. \nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, as it relates to your overall revenue guide for September of down 11% sequentially, should we be thinking that each business is down similar to that rate? Is one doing better than the other? Could you shed a little light on that, please? \nDavid Goeckeler: Sure. I mean I think we're seeing retail -- last quarter, we started off in the retail business, which is roughly 20% of the business is really challenged, and it got better as the quarter went on and June was good. It wasn't quite all the way back to normal, but it was strong. And we've seen that continue through July. And we're expecting that business to be positive in the quarter going forward. And if you look at all the other businesses, the cloud, again, we talked about that, we see a digestion phase there. We see the OEMs kind of really watching inventory and managing that tighter. And then I talked about the channel. So as we said, long term, we see good things where the portfolio is going. But in the near term, that's how we see the 4 major businesses. \nChristopher Muse: And so if I just read between the lines, given the commentary on retail, that would suggest NAND might be a little bit better than HDD? \nRobert Eulau: I wouldn't draw specific -- yes. \nDavid Goeckeler: I don't know if I'd go into that level of detail. \nChristopher Muse: Okay. And I guess a question on the flash side and to follow up on Mehdi's question. For the June quarter, I guess I was a little bit surprised by the lower ASP uplift but higher bit growth. I guess can you comment on what drove that? And I guess just to follow up, should we be assuming similar mix as the June quarter, coupled with an uplift in gaming, to -- as we build out our ASP kind of assumptions? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So I'll make a few comments. I'm sure Bob will make a few comments. I mean part of the ASP, looking back, was retail where ASPs were -- for flash were more challenged. So that's a big piece of that number. I think going forward, you shouldn't expect a tremendously different mix. Minus what you said, gaming, was it -- and it was good to see gaming start to ramp up. We expect that to continue to ramp through the second half of the year and take a low double-digit percent of our supply. So that's a good story. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. And I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think in the transactional businesses, we've definitely seen more pricing pressure than we've seen from the OEMs. Although overall, we think prices will be down this quarter. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk about in the NAND business, just how comfortable you are. I mean last year, you -- when things got kind of weak, you guys took underutilization actions to kind of clean up inventory. You're not doing that now. Does that suggest supply/demand is in a healthier place? Or just anything you can kind of tell us about the state of your inventory, customer inventory and your plan there. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and Bob can make a few comments. Yes, I think we feel good about the amount -- the industry keeping supply/demand in balance. I mean, clearly, we've got a -- in a recession, we have a drop in demand. So we're seeing some pricing implications of that. But we feel like the -- kind of where supply/demand is, is fairly balanced going forward. We're certainly watching our CapEx investments very closely and managing more tightly with our partner. But Bob, do you want to say anything about inventory? Or... \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I mean I joined the company right in the middle of the last trough. And I can tell you the supply and demand imbalance is nothing like it was then today. So I think everybody is behaving pretty rationally. We still see the industry growing bits and then -- bits, both supply and demand, in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%, and that's our intention as well. \nJoseph Moore: Okay. And then for my follow-up, it sounds like you're pretty comfortable on the adjusted EBITDA covenant calculations for September. But obviously, memory can be uncertain beyond that. Can you talk about your comfort level overall on the covenants? And is there anything -- any actions you could take if things got worse to sort of make sure you don't have any issues there? \nRobert Eulau: So I'm very comfortable. In fact, if you go back like to the trough I was just talking about, we never really got that close to breaching the covenant on the adjusted basis. So I really don't think there's much of a risk there. \nT. Peter Andrew: Joe, also just to put a little bit more transparency into the credit agreement metrics, please make sure you take a look at the slide deck that's on our website. We've got a lot more detail on that metric in there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. \nAnanda Baruah: I guess the first one for me is with regards to the gross margin guidance. Could you give us a sense of which part of the business you expect to contract more of the hard drives versus the flash? It sounds like on flash, there's slight mix, and on retail, Bob, as per your remarks, slight pricing pressure. They're not from OEM contract yet. And then it sounds like on the hard drive business, it's probably more mix related. Is there anything in addition to that? And then could you just give us a sense of magnitude for each of these businesses? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I mean I'll touch on it again. I don't want to get into too many specifics. As you know, we only guide gross margin for the company overall. But we're definitely seeing pressures on both sides, both on the hard drive and on the flash. Like we said before, we've got significant product transition going on, on the hard drive side. We've got a yield curve that we're working our way up. And we've got the COVID-19 pressures that they won't be as bad this coming quarter, the quarter we're in now, as they were last quarter. But we definitely have pressures on the hard drive side. And I would say on the flash side, we're seeing pressures primarily on price and a little bit of mix and then the K1 costs that we talked about as well. \nAnanda Baruah: Right, the K1 costs. And guys, any -- you mentioned about going through a period of digestion in cloud that dovetails with your top competitors' remarks and also with the remarks of the hyperscalers. Any context you can provide around just sort of do you think that means this cycle is through? Or does digestion to you guys really just mean like a period of digestion and then you think, \"We can get back to some semblance of growth again in the near future?\" \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, look, I mean, we see -- we -- it's a long-term growth market. I mean we see 30%, 35% CAGR exabyte growth in that market for years to come. We're coming off of a couple of quarters of significantly above that. It's not surprising we would go through a little bit of time where all of that capacity gets deployed. But I think just look at the world around us, I mean, we're all using the cloud more every day. I think the last 5 months have accelerated the amount of transformation that was going to happen in using of cloud technology significantly. So I don't -- I'm not exactly how we would both define a cycle. But I see a really good long-term trend in this, and I see us well positioned as well. That's why this coming quarter is important for us to get the 18, 16 platform ramped, get the 1 million units produced, get those shipped to put ourselves in a good position for that continued growth. \nRobert Eulau: And just the one thing I would add. I just think there's been a lot of supply chain disruption this year, both in terms of our own production, our customers trying to make sure they get supply. Now our customers are working off inventory levels. So I just think between the pandemic and the recession and concerns on supply, it's been a very challenging year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. \nMitch Steves: I just wanted to follow up a bit on the gross margin side. So when you talk about COVID-19 issue kind of being a little bit better than you guys saw or better than last quarter, how do we think about the bigger drivers of your gross margins going back to 30%? Is there really going to be a NAND improvement on pricing? Or is it going to be a lot of supply chain issues? I'm trying to get an understanding of what's really moving the margins so dramatically on a quarterly basis. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll maybe paint a big picture of that, and Bob wants to go into a little bit of detail. So I mean, it's both important on both sides. But one is, on flash, first of all, continue to BiCS5. BiCS4 is a great node for us, giving us cost reductions and performance we need. The BiCS5 transition, I think the team made really, really sound choices on going to that technology. As we talked about, the yields have been impressive. We're kind of ahead of internal plans on that node. So continuing to drive that technology road map that gives us cost advantages is the first part of it. And then secondly, it's optimizing the portfolio on top of it for the markets we play in for optimizing gross margin. That's -- as you see us moving more to enterprise SSD, things that we think are going to drive higher margins. So that's a big part of it on flash. And of course, then you got pricing on top of that, which is a market concern. \n On the hard drive side, again, it's -- gross margin to me is led by innovation. So we ramp the 18-, 16-terabyte platform, that's a better TCO for our customers. That's a better value proposition for them. That's higher gross margins for us. So that's why we're so focused on getting that -- getting up the production ramp on that and why we feel good about that platform. So those are the main drivers from my perspective. Bob? \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I don't think I have much to add. I mean I think it's clear, we've got room to improve in both the hard drive area and in the flash area. And we've got the products to make it happen. \nMitch Steves: Got it. And then just one other small one, just on the smartphone cycle. I mean it's been very clear that some of the bigger products got pushed out, right, so their time -- that they're going to ramp up more in Q4 into the Q3. Can you maybe give us an understanding of how that impacts you? And how you guys think about the push-out as it relates to the flash business? \nRobert Eulau: I guess I can start. \nDavid Goeckeler: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. What was... \nRobert Eulau: It was on mobile. \nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. I'm sorry. \nRobert Eulau: I'll start. So as you know, we've been underweight in mobile for quite a while. We continue to be underweight in terms of mobile. Now if that business is lower than what's anticipated, our competitors need to find homes for those bits. So we're not completely insulated from the challenges on the mobile side because they do need to move into other markets in order to move the bits. But I think in terms of our strategy of focusing on the other areas, I think it's worked out pretty well. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: On the NAND side, SSD side, I know you probably don't want to comment on how much do you think NAND price is going to come down. But hypothetically, if prices start to decline more rapidly than your cost improvement over the next few quarters, say, 10%, 15%, 20% a quarter, how would you respond to that kind of pricing environment in terms of inventory utilization, CapEx and so on and so forth? \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I guess I can start. I mean -- and first of all, our view on cost reduction is still around 15% a year. So we don't see that changing. We think that's what you're going to see in the 3D era because it's so much more capital-intensive. And what we think you're going to see is a competitive marketplace where people are behaving rationally. I mean that's -- a lot of the reports that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, it seems like everybody is trying to make sure we don't end up in an oversupply situation. And we're going to be cautious, as I said, in terms of how we invest in our capital. Some of the CapEx we're funding right now is related to equipment we put in place last fiscal year. So we'll keep a very close eye in terms of what's going on in terms of the balance of supply and demand. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean I don't like to deal too much in hypotheticals. But we've got a lot of conviction in that market. If you just look at gaming really coming on in the second half of this year, as you said, the 5G cycle may move around a little bit, but it's still out there. So there's a lot of demand drivers, and we believe in that 30% CAGR in that market on the demand side. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. \nShannon Cross: I was just wondering if you could take a step back when you were coming up with your guidance sort of from a higher level. How much of it is coming from a lack of visibility versus maybe specific conversations with your customers? And then if you're looking at where there might be an opportunity for upside, where would that be? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I would say, in general, we look at a wide range of data points. I mean some of the businesses are like a retail business, what's the trend that's going on there and what do we see and what may be disruptions. For example, in the period ahead, we typically see a back-to-school cycle. It's unclear what that's going to look like. So that puts some variability in the forecast. But we talked to our -- our teams are very, very close to our customers. So we're talking to them on a near daily basis and getting a very -- a sense of what -- how they're thinking about their end markets and what the signals they're giving us for demand. And we're factoring all of that in to kind of what they're telling us and what we see as the bias. And then we're wrapping in new product quals. I mean we talked about it in our prepared remarks. \n We're going through a bunch of very substantial product transitions. Now we feel really good about that, but we got to get through it. There's risk in those. So we make a risk-adjusted view of which of those are going to hit, which of them are not, which ones may move around for various reasons. I think I said it earlier, we have twice as many quals going right now as we did last year, and the number is over 450. So there's a lot of activity across the portfolio. The big ones, there's probably 2, 3, 4 dozen really big ones. So we factor that in as well. And we understand when they're going to hit and put some judgment around that. We wrap it all up into the guide. So if some of those quals move around, they could be in a positive or negative, there's enough of them that hopefully that balances out. But we put together our best view of what we think is going to happen over the next quarter. \nOperator: Our Next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel. \nPatrick Ho: Dave, maybe just following up on some of the NAND questions. You talked about the strong demand you're seeing for the BiCS5 product. Given some of the market dynamics that are going on right now, and you mentioned some price erosion and maybe a little bit of inventory that's been built and some digestion, how do you see that potentially affecting the ramp of the BiCS5 product? Does that push it out somewhat? Or are we going to see maybe a potentially steeper BiCS4 decline as BiCS5 ramps up? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I want to be careful. I don't think I talked about BiCS5 demand in the sense of BiCS. So I don't -- our customers just look for the NAND products, and it's up to us to build the right technology for that. And as we drive the road map forward, we can get more advantageous cost for us. And what we're saying on BiCS5 is the development of the technology is going well, and the yields are going well. We've got the product in the retail channel already, and we are working on all the engineering work to put it into the whole product portfolio. So we will look to accelerate that work as much as we can to get as many things on that node as possible. But there's a lot of work to do there, right? Before we -- BiCS4 is a great node for us. It's providing us the performance and cost advantages that we need. As I said, I think 60% of our bits this quarter were beyond BiCS4. You're going to see us -- BiCS4 will be our major node for several quarters to come as we work on the transition in the portfolio to BiCS5, which will then carry us for another several years. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. \nSrinivas Pajjuri: I have a question about the cost on the NAND side. Bob, can you talk about as BiCS5 ramps, I think previously, you said your cost decline expectation is about mid-teens or so, annual. As BiCS5 ramps, do you still expect that? And then also on the K1 cost, you said $80 million this quarter is the peak. And if demand continues to remain weak, how should we think about that $80 million coming down over the next few quarters? \nRobert Eulau: Yes. So I guess a couple of questions in there. First of all, we still believe over a number of quarters, we're going to average 15% year-over-year cost declines, and we think that's pretty sustainable. We've been able to achieve that with BiCS4. We think we'll be able to achieve that with BiCS5, and we'll continue to work through the transition. As Dave was just saying, it's going to take several quarters to ramp up on BiCS5. It's not going to be overnight, we throw a switch and we're on BiCS5. And BiCS4 has worked out really well. BiCS4 will be an even bigger percentage of the total next quarter than it is this quarter. So we still have a ways to go on BiCS4. \n And then in terms of the K1 costs, we do believe this is the peak. There's a lot of equipment getting installed. As you know, it's a long cycle time. So we've got to get products through the cycle. And then we'll be able to capitalize or inventory more of those costs and bring down the period expenses as we move forward. So I think we're getting to the point where our volumes are getting up there where the period expenses will start to go away. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. \nVijay Rakesh: Just 2 questions. I was wondering on the hard disc drive side, on the 18-terabyte, I know you mentioned it's a big product for you. Will you be shipping -- and you said more than 1 million units here. So do you expect that to ramp to a couple of million in December quarter? How does that ramp? \n And also, on the NAND side, it looks like that $80 million cost for Q1 start-up in September is almost like 300 bps of a gross margin headwind. So is that a clear -- 350 bps of gross margin headwind looks like. So is that the majority of the gross margin headwind on NAND? Or is pricing a bigger factor in there? \nRobert Eulau: Do you want me to start? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. You start with K1. \nRobert Eulau: Okay. Yes. Let me start on K1. So we've been averaging around $60 million a quarter the last 4 quarters in terms of period expenses for the K1 fab. And then as we said, in the September quarter, we're going to go up to $80 million. So incrementally, it's about $20 million. On the flash revenue, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of an incremental point. And as I just finished commenting on, as we start to ramp volumes, and we are, we'll start to absorb those costs. And I think we'll definitely see that number coming down in the couple of quarters following the September quarter. So I think we're in good shape there. \n And then in terms of volumes on the hard drive side, I mean, we're -- we definitely have plans to produce over 1 million units of 18- and 16-terabyte product. And we'll get as many of those out the door as we can this quarter. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We're not putting a number out there for the December quarter. But I think as we said, we want to get ourselves in a position where we're up the yield curves and we've got the manufacturing capacity to really step on the gas on that node. We're doing that now. We're working -- so this quarter, the important number is to get the production up so that we can get up that curve. And of course, we'll ship as many of them as we can. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing we're at the bottom of the hour and drawing to a close. I would now like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks. \nT. Peter Andrew: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for taking the time to listen to Western Digital today. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Good night. \nRobert Eulau: Thanks, everyone. \nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, folks. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy and safe. \n As I reflect on my first full quarter as CEO of Western Digital, I am extremely proud of the way our team has navigated the complexities and uncertainties inherent in this unprecedented environment. As a company, we continue to adapt to provide continuity and high-quality products for our customers, deliver value to our shareholders and, importantly, prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We have a unique view into many drivers and trends that play both domestically and internationally due to the breadth of our portfolio of innovative flash and hard drive solutions going into cloud, OEM channel and retail end markets. We look at our business holistically, but it is especially important now to understand the nuances, challenges and opportunities in each market we serve. \n So before we dig into the results for the quarter and full year, I want to talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro trends are impacting the business. I'll then update you on how we are thinking about our strategic priorities for the fiscal year 2021, before turning it over to Bob for a financial update, which will be followed by Q&A. \n Western Digital has successfully managed through this unpredictable time with limited business impact from the pandemic. We made important investments and changes to minimize manufacturing and logistical challenges that were primarily impacting our hard drive business. Bob will discuss the financial impact of these later in the call. And we have maintained our focus on delivering for customers throughout. \n From an end market standpoint, demand was mixed in the quarter. And if there's a common theme among our end markets, it's uncertainty. In the second half of fiscal 2020, customers were focused on ensuring they had enough supply to meet heightened demand. As expected, demand in our cloud business was strong due to the work-from-home trend. At the same time, healthy demand for our flash-based notebook solutions drove record revenue in our OEM end market. Finally, in retail, while we have a robust distribution channel with over 350,000 points of purchase around the world and well-established brands, we were impacted by COVID-related lockdowns at many of our brick-and-mortar customers. We did see the business recover as the quarter progressed due to easing of lockdowns and the transition to online buying with curbside pickup. \n As we look to the first half of fiscal 2020, one, uncertainty remains. We remain vigilant given the resurgence of the virus and its potential to disrupt our supply chain, including our ability to keep full teams working in our manufacturing facilities. Apart from COVID-19, we're managing through other macro trends. The global economic contraction is generally -- is generating an uncertain demand environment, and we are closely monitoring trade-related geopolitical developments, which are pertinent to a global business like ours. These near-term headwinds will eventually subside, and we are confident that the strength of our portfolio and strong customer relationships are well aligned to where the growth is, in the cloud and on the edge. We've continued to make strategic technology and product investments in both flash and hard drives to drive long-term revenue growth and gross margin expansion. \n Now turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, results were generally in line with our guidance. We achieved this while partially offsetting higher-than-anticipated COVID-19-related costs, which Bob will discuss in more detail. We reported revenue of $4.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, mainly driven by growth in the cloud and record results for our client SSD portfolio for notebooks. \n Looking back at the full fiscal year 2020, I am pleased with our performance. Our end market diversity and breadth, broad customer base, channel reach and innovative leadership all positioned Western Digital to benefit from the multiyear growth in data creation and storage. For fiscal 2020, revenue totaled $16.7 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.04. We continue to align our portfolio with a sharp focus on growth and margin improvement. \n Importantly, over the last year, we brought to market several exciting new innovations across both flash and hard drives that I'd like to touch upon. \n Starting with flash. As you know, we believe flash is the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital and is an area where we've already had a tremendous foundation with consumer cards, USB drives and client and enterprise SSDs. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, the migration to flash within game consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support a new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that underpins a multiyear growth opportunity. \n To capitalize on this opportunity, we launched BiCS5, our 112-layer flash product in retail last quarter, which delivers exceptional capacity, performance and reliability, all at an attractive cost. The ramp has gone very well with impressive yields, and we are just at the beginning stages of this product ramp. While we focus on ramping BiCS5, BiCS4 has continued to provide the right balance of performance and cost reduction. BiCS4 represented over 60% of bits shipped in the quarter. \n Earlier this year, we celebrated the first production wafer shipment from our K1 fab, our new manufacturing facility for 3D BiCS flash memory. This is another important milestone reflecting the successful 20-year partnership we've had with Kioxia. Another major highlight has been the ramp of our enterprise SSD product line. Enterprise SSD revenue in the quarter grew nearly 70% sequentially, and our revenue share increased to the low double digits. This will remain an important area of focus within our flash portfolio. \n Now turning to hard drives. We continue to lead the industry in aerial density using innovations across the entire drive, algorithms, firmware, mechanical heads and media. We were the first in the industry to ship energy-assisted drives for mass production and expect a strong ramp into the fiscal second quarter and beyond. In short, we are going through important product transitions in both our flash and HDD businesses that we think set up Western Digital well for the future. \n Recognizing that these are uncertain times, we believe that the most important thing we can do is keep our foot on the proverbial innovation pedal and execute on the road map across the business. We have an extremely talented team working on new products that will continue to drive leadership in flash and hard drives. \n Looking ahead, our strategic priorities are centered around driving innovation for customers and value for shareholders. First and foremost, we will focus on driving long-term shareholder value as we bolster our flash and HDD portfolios, including ramping 2 important product lines to high volume, our SSD products and our energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives. Secondly, we will accelerate our transition to BiCS5, delivering additional performance for our customers and notable cost advantages for Western Digital. Third, we will continue to sharpen our execution from a product road map and strategic business objectives. And finally, we are evolving our portfolio to drive growth, margin improvement and cash generation while also paying down debt and investing in the future. In the near term, we expect to remain challenged by the pandemic and the global economic contraction. Internally, we're also navigating multiple substantial product transitions, which will require sharp execution focus. But we are very confident they will set us up well for the long term. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to share our financial highlights and outlook. Thanks, Bob. While we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment, I am confident that Western Digital can lead the market for years to come. As I've said, I came here because I have a very strong conviction that Western Digital can play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation, and that conviction has only strengthened in the past 5 months. We have deep flash and HDD product portfolio, operational scale and great customer relationships, combined with the ever-growing demand for data creation and storage. \n All in all, it's a great place to be, and I'm extremely thankful for the hard work that our talented global team puts in on a day in and day out basis. We are operating in uncertain times, but Western Digital's strong, consistent performance reflects our ability to maintain our market leadership by delivering technological innovation with the quality, performance and cost effectiveness that our customers rely upon. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. Yes. No, it hasn't pushed out. The ramp is on plan, as we've talked about. We plan on producing in excess of 1 million units this quarter. It's a very important quarter for us on that ramp, Wamsi, because it's the quarter where we get the yields up, which gets us the margin profile we need to go into the second quarter of the fiscal year at full production capacity. So it's on track where we want it to be. We feel good about it, and this is going to be an important quarter for us. But it's something we know how to do in ramping a drive platform. Yes. I'll make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Bob to make a few comments. And I think if you look at gross margin going forward, there's a number of headwinds. We still have the COVID costs. We don't expect them to be as high next quarter as they were this quarter, but they're still there, the logistics cost, especially. It's just a very dynamic environment there that changes week by week. We've got the ramp of the 18-terabyte drive that we just talked about. So in the beginning phases of that ramp, you're going to -- it's a headwind on gross margin till we get up the ramp. That's why this is such an important quarter for us that we work through that. And as I said, that's on track. And then on flash, we've got an easing pricing environment. So that's going to impact gross margin there. Bob, any -- did I miss anything? So I'll take the second one. Bob can talk a little bit more about the first. The -- all the businesses transacting at 14T, it's a very competitive point in the market. There's no doubt about that. We're at the -- we're kind of at the tail end of one generation, moving to the next one, and that's why getting up the AT&T ramp is so -- 18, 16 ramp is so important for us. And that will position us well and be able to drive accretive margins to the portfolio on that point. But we expect that as we get 18 out there and the conversations with customers, it's a different TCO proposition for our customers. And that leads to more value for both of us. So we're heading to a better spot. I don't know. Bob, do you want to characterize COVID a little bit in this quarter? It's kind of -- it's a little tough because it's so dynamic. Yes. We feel like we're definitely going into a digestion phase. If we look at -- we're coming off of 3 really strong quarters of exabyte shipment, and the demand signals we're getting are going to be -- are a little bit down for the next quarter or 2. We think that -- I mean, the long-term trend is obviously still good. We're using the cloud more every day. But there's been a lot of product shipped in there in the last couple of quarters. And what we're seeing from them is, they're all not the same, right? We have all of them. So they're all at different points. But when you add it all up, you see next quarter, there's a negative bias on demand there from what we see looking backwards. Yes. So on the enterprise SSD, you're right. We've done a lot of work to launch a new product in enterprise SSD. We've got a couple of new products. The first one is out, and it's targeted to the cloud providers. The product targeted to the OEMs is yet to ship. So that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So we really are in a big product transition there. So it's hard for me to draw a conclusion to your question about on-prem versus the cloud given enterprise SSD because we're mainly focused on the cloud side right now, working our way through quals and all those kinds of things. Given that the product is new, given that we're going through a lot of qualifications, over a multi-quarter time frame, I expect us to get better and better. It's going to be a little lumpy as we move through that. So if I look at the number of quals going on in the organization, it's across all technologies. We have twice as many quals going on as we had a year ago this time. So that gives you an idea of where -- how the portfolio is refreshing, and we're driving that into the market. \n On the hard drive side, I guess I can talk about the OEMs in the private data center more of just as an overall market. I mean, well, let me save that response for a different time because that's more PC-related. But I don't know if I have a tremendous amount of insight. Bob, I don't know if you do on the hard drive side versus on-prem versus in the cloud, if we could draw any strong conclusions for that. Yes. I'll elaborate on the general market. I don't know if I can follow the back of your envelope that fast. But look, I think the channel was -- let me talk about the channel in general and smart video as a part of that. That was a real slog this past quarter. I mean the team worked really hard on it. We thought we saw TAM shrinkage there, significant TAM shrinkage of $100 million or so a year throughout the quarter. So it was -- we look at -- to us, that's a good indication of overall demand that's out there, and it was tough and related to that, and we see that going forward kind of a negative bias on that market. So I don't know, Bob, if you have any additional comments on the smart video, in particular. Yes. I mean I think this overall theme you're hearing from us, which is as we look at -- I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter, we see some challenges given COVID, given the state of the economy, given all the demand we've seen in the first half and the inventory rationalizations and digestions that are going on. But in all of those markets, we see very good long-term trends. And so it's a question of how fast that comes back. But all of the -- I think the pandemic has shown us the amount that all of us are relying on technology, and I think our portfolio is as well positioned for that world as it has been in some time. Sure. I mean I think we're seeing retail -- last quarter, we started off in the retail business, which is roughly 20% of the business is really challenged, and it got better as the quarter went on and June was good. It wasn't quite all the way back to normal, but it was strong. And we've seen that continue through July. And we're expecting that business to be positive in the quarter going forward. And if you look at all the other businesses, the cloud, again, we talked about that, we see a digestion phase there. We see the OEMs kind of really watching inventory and managing that tighter. And then I talked about the channel. So as we said, long term, we see good things where the portfolio is going. But in the near term, that's how we see the 4 major businesses. I don't know if I'd go into that level of detail. Yes. So I'll make a few comments. I'm sure Bob will make a few comments. I mean part of the ASP, looking back, was retail where ASPs were -- for flash were more challenged. So that's a big piece of that number. I think going forward, you shouldn't expect a tremendously different mix. Minus what you said, gaming, was it -- and it was good to see gaming start to ramp up. We expect that to continue to ramp through the second half of the year and take a low double-digit percent of our supply. So that's a good story. Yes. I'll make a few comments, and Bob can make a few comments. Yes, I think we feel good about the amount -- the industry keeping supply/demand in balance. I mean, clearly, we've got a -- in a recession, we have a drop in demand. So we're seeing some pricing implications of that. But we feel like the -- kind of where supply/demand is, is fairly balanced going forward. We're certainly watching our CapEx investments very closely and managing more tightly with our partner. But Bob, do you want to say anything about inventory? Or... Yes. I mean, look, I mean, we see -- we -- it's a long-term growth market. I mean we see 30%, 35% CAGR exabyte growth in that market for years to come. We're coming off of a couple of quarters of significantly above that. It's not surprising we would go through a little bit of time where all of that capacity gets deployed. But I think just look at the world around us, I mean, we're all using the cloud more every day. I think the last 5 months have accelerated the amount of transformation that was going to happen in using of cloud technology significantly. So I don't -- I'm not exactly how we would both define a cycle. But I see a really good long-term trend in this, and I see us well positioned as well. That's why this coming quarter is important for us to get the 18, 16 platform ramped, get the 1 million units produced, get those shipped to put ourselves in a good position for that continued growth. Yes. I'll maybe paint a big picture of that, and Bob wants to go into a little bit of detail. So I mean, it's both important on both sides. But one is, on flash, first of all, continue to BiCS5. BiCS4 is a great node for us, giving us cost reductions and performance we need. The BiCS5 transition, I think the team made really, really sound choices on going to that technology. As we talked about, the yields have been impressive. We're kind of ahead of internal plans on that node. So continuing to drive that technology road map that gives us cost advantages is the first part of it. And then secondly, it's optimizing the portfolio on top of it for the markets we play in for optimizing gross margin. That's -- as you see us moving more to enterprise SSD, things that we think are going to drive higher margins. So that's a big part of it on flash. And of course, then you got pricing on top of that, which is a market concern. \n On the hard drive side, again, it's -- gross margin to me is led by innovation. So we ramp the 18-, 16-terabyte platform, that's a better TCO for our customers. That's a better value proposition for them. That's higher gross margins for us. So that's why we're so focused on getting that -- getting up the production ramp on that and why we feel good about that platform. So those are the main drivers from my perspective. Bob? I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. What was... Okay. I'm sorry. Yes. I mean I don't like to deal too much in hypotheticals. But we've got a lot of conviction in that market. If you just look at gaming really coming on in the second half of this year, as you said, the 5G cycle may move around a little bit, but it's still out there. So there's a lot of demand drivers, and we believe in that 30% CAGR in that market on the demand side. Yes. I would say, in general, we look at a wide range of data points. I mean some of the businesses are like a retail business, what's the trend that's going on there and what do we see and what may be disruptions. For example, in the period ahead, we typically see a back-to-school cycle. It's unclear what that's going to look like. So that puts some variability in the forecast. But we talked to our -- our teams are very, very close to our customers. So we're talking to them on a near daily basis and getting a very -- a sense of what -- how they're thinking about their end markets and what the signals they're giving us for demand. And we're factoring all of that in to kind of what they're telling us and what we see as the bias. And then we're wrapping in new product quals. I mean we talked about it in our prepared remarks. \n We're going through a bunch of very substantial product transitions. Now we feel really good about that, but we got to get through it. There's risk in those. So we make a risk-adjusted view of which of those are going to hit, which of them are not, which ones may move around for various reasons. I think I said it earlier, we have twice as many quals going right now as we did last year, and the number is over 450. So there's a lot of activity across the portfolio. The big ones, there's probably 2, 3, 4 dozen really big ones. So we factor that in as well. And we understand when they're going to hit and put some judgment around that. We wrap it all up into the guide. So if some of those quals move around, they could be in a positive or negative, there's enough of them that hopefully that balances out. But we put together our best view of what we think is going to happen over the next quarter. Yes. I want to be careful. I don't think I talked about BiCS5 demand in the sense of BiCS. So I don't -- our customers just look for the NAND products, and it's up to us to build the right technology for that. And as we drive the road map forward, we can get more advantageous cost for us. And what we're saying on BiCS5 is the development of the technology is going well, and the yields are going well. We've got the product in the retail channel already, and we are working on all the engineering work to put it into the whole product portfolio. So we will look to accelerate that work as much as we can to get as many things on that node as possible. But there's a lot of work to do there, right? Before we -- BiCS4 is a great node for us. It's providing us the performance and cost advantages that we need. As I said, I think 60% of our bits this quarter were beyond BiCS4. You're going to see us -- BiCS4 will be our major node for several quarters to come as we work on the transition in the portfolio to BiCS5, which will then carry us for another several years. Yes. You start with K1. Yes. We're not putting a number out there for the December quarter. But I think as we said, we want to get ourselves in a position where we're up the yield curves and we've got the manufacturing capacity to really step on the gas on that node. We're doing that now. We're working -- so this quarter, the important number is to get the production up so that we can get up that curve. And of course, we'll ship as many of them as we can. Thanks, folks."

            "name": "Robert Eulau",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a challenging global economy that has continued to impact Western Digital's performance, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty that both we and our customers are facing. While this uncertainty isn't going away in the near term, we'll continue to adapt, and we believe Western Digital is well positioned for the future. \n With that, I'll walk you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 18% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.7 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2019, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.04. \n Looking at end market. Client Devices revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5% on a sequential basis and up 19% year-over-year. Within this end market, our robust family of client SSDs, which are ideally suited for remote learning and work-from-home applications, achieved another record quarter of revenue. Notebook and desktop-related hard drive revenue declined slightly sequentially as the market continued to transition to SSD-based products. Smart video was weaker than our expectations due to continued headwinds associated with the pandemic. In gaming, we began shipping our flash solutions for the upcoming new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue was down sequentially, but up year-over-year off a low base. \n Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, revenue of $6.2 billion was up 24% from fiscal year 2019. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was down slightly on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew nearly 70% sequentially and more than doubled from a year ago. \n Next, Client Solutions revenue was $687 million, down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Despite this, we were encouraged to see demand pick up in June as countries began to ease lockdown restrictions and as brick-and-mortar locations shifted more of their operations online. This strength continued into July. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we executed very well in this business in a difficult environment. With over 350,000 points of purchase around the world, we continue to have incredibly strong distribution breadth and brand recognition. \n Turning to revenue by product category. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 49% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 1% sequentially on a blended basis and up 3% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Total exabyte shipments were down 2%. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 2% to $87 as mix continued to shift to the cloud. \n As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 1 percentage point sequentially to 28.9%, slightly below our guidance range. The major item that impacted our gross margin was COVID-19-related costs of $96 million. This almost exclusively impacted hard drives -- the hard drive business and was primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics costs. For clarity, this item was included in our non-GAAP gross margin. \n Our flash gross margin was 30.5%, up 4 percentage points from last quarter due to cost reductions and slightly favorable pricing. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The biggest driver of the lower gross margin was the $96 million in COVID-19-related costs, representing a 4.7 percentage point impact on our hard drive gross margin. \n Operating expenses were $713 million, well below our guidance range, primarily due to our decision to cap variable compensation expense given the current economic environment. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $172 million, and free cash flow was $261 million. In fiscal 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. \n Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $89 million due to the timing of funds flowing to and from the joint ventures. In the fourth quarter, we distributed $150 million in dividends to our shareholders, which was our final distribution prior to suspending the dividend. We also made a standard $63 million debt repayment in the fourth quarter. I would note that we have already made an optional debt repayment of $150 million in July. \n Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.7 billion. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.2x in the fourth quarter. And our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.8x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes an approximate $1 billion in depreciation add back associated with the joint ventures, which is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. \n Moving on to guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We are somewhat challenged in the near term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic and being in the midst of a global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and focus on our great products, deep customer relationships and large and growing markets. We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long term. \n We expect revenue in the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of $3.70 billion to $3.9 billion. Growth in Client Solutions is expected to be more than offset by a decline in both Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Devices. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25% and 27%. This range includes approximately $80 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. This should be the peak quarter in fiscal 2021 for K1 period expenses. We expect operating expenses to be between $700 million and $720 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $70 million and $80 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 26% in Q1 and for the full fiscal year of 2021. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.65 in Q1, assuming approximately 304 million fully diluted shares. \n Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of the joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures. We will continue to monitor capital expenditures very closely given the current business environment. \n In summary, we are executing well in a challenging environment, and results are generally in line with our expectations. We are taking decisive steps to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment while ensuring we focus our resources to address the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead. \n I'll now turn it back over to Dave. No. I think those are the keys. I mean on the hard drives, obviously, volumes are a little lower. So we'll be amortizing our fixed costs over a smaller volume as we go up the yield ramp on the 18-terabyte drives. Now on the flash side, as Dave said, I mean, we've got some price and mix headwind. And we also -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have costs up a bit on K1, which amounts to about 1 percentage point on the flash side. So it's just we have multiple challenges this quarter. But I think long term, we're going to be really well positioned once we get up these product ramps. Yes. Yes. It's not going to be as significant as last quarter. And last quarter, we did offset the COVID cost a bit by pricing. But it obviously did not fully offset it. That's a big number. As we look at Q1, we don't think we're going to have the kind of absorption variances that we had last quarter. You may recall in the earnings call in April, I said that we had some challenges on volumes in April. So we already knew we had that headwind last quarter. We don't have that issue this quarter. So I would say the costs will be down, but I don't want to be too specific. We think we've got it covered in the guidance range that we articulated. No. I think we're seeing softness in both areas as we move forward into Q1. No. I agree in the short term. If we look over the longer-time horizon, that is going to be another area of growth in the hard drive business. So we really see the capacity in enterprise business and the smart video business growing as we look over multiple years. Yes. So I think there are a bunch of pieces in there, Mehdi. So game console is definitely a growth area, and we're very fortunate to be participating in that. And as you know, we haven't been in the hard drive side of that business for quite a while. So it's all upside from our perspective. And then I would say, overall, there may be slight mix changes as we go quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing some pressure in terms of price, and that's factored into our guidance as well. I think the biggest change is the one I mentioned on game consoles becoming more significant. But otherwise, it will be up and down here and there, but I don't think it'll be that material. I wouldn't draw specific -- yes. Yes. And I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think in the transactional businesses, we've definitely seen more pricing pressure than we've seen from the OEMs. Although overall, we think prices will be down this quarter. Yes. I mean I joined the company right in the middle of the last trough. And I can tell you the supply and demand imbalance is nothing like it was then today. So I think everybody is behaving pretty rationally. We still see the industry growing bits and then -- bits, both supply and demand, in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%, and that's our intention as well. So I'm very comfortable. In fact, if you go back like to the trough I was just talking about, we never really got that close to breaching the covenant on the adjusted basis. So I really don't think there's much of a risk there. Yes. I mean I'll touch on it again. I don't want to get into too many specifics. As you know, we only guide gross margin for the company overall. But we're definitely seeing pressures on both sides, both on the hard drive and on the flash. Like we said before, we've got significant product transition going on, on the hard drive side. We've got a yield curve that we're working our way up. And we've got the COVID-19 pressures that they won't be as bad this coming quarter, the quarter we're in now, as they were last quarter. But we definitely have pressures on the hard drive side. And I would say on the flash side, we're seeing pressures primarily on price and a little bit of mix and then the K1 costs that we talked about as well. And just the one thing I would add. I just think there's been a lot of supply chain disruption this year, both in terms of our own production, our customers trying to make sure they get supply. Now our customers are working off inventory levels. So I just think between the pandemic and the recession and concerns on supply, it's been a very challenging year. Yes. I don't think I have much to add. I mean I think it's clear, we've got room to improve in both the hard drive area and in the flash area. And we've got the products to make it happen. I guess I can start. It was on mobile. I'll start. So as you know, we've been underweight in mobile for quite a while. We continue to be underweight in terms of mobile. Now if that business is lower than what's anticipated, our competitors need to find homes for those bits. So we're not completely insulated from the challenges on the mobile side because they do need to move into other markets in order to move the bits. But I think in terms of our strategy of focusing on the other areas, I think it's worked out pretty well. Yes. I guess I can start. I mean -- and first of all, our view on cost reduction is still around 15% a year. So we don't see that changing. We think that's what you're going to see in the 3D era because it's so much more capital-intensive. And what we think you're going to see is a competitive marketplace where people are behaving rationally. I mean that's -- a lot of the reports that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, it seems like everybody is trying to make sure we don't end up in an oversupply situation. And we're going to be cautious, as I said, in terms of how we invest in our capital. Some of the CapEx we're funding right now is related to equipment we put in place last fiscal year. So we'll keep a very close eye in terms of what's going on in terms of the balance of supply and demand. Yes. So I guess a couple of questions in there. First of all, we still believe over a number of quarters, we're going to average 15% year-over-year cost declines, and we think that's pretty sustainable. We've been able to achieve that with BiCS4. We think we'll be able to achieve that with BiCS5, and we'll continue to work through the transition. As Dave was just saying, it's going to take several quarters to ramp up on BiCS5. It's not going to be overnight, we throw a switch and we're on BiCS5. And BiCS4 has worked out really well. BiCS4 will be an even bigger percentage of the total next quarter than it is this quarter. So we still have a ways to go on BiCS4. \n And then in terms of the K1 costs, we do believe this is the peak. There's a lot of equipment getting installed. As you know, it's a long cycle time. So we've got to get products through the cycle. And then we'll be able to capitalize or inventory more of those costs and bring down the period expenses as we move forward. So I think we're getting to the point where our volumes are getting up there where the period expenses will start to go away. Do you want me to start? Okay. Yes. Let me start on K1. So we've been averaging around $60 million a quarter the last 4 quarters in terms of period expenses for the K1 fab. And then as we said, in the September quarter, we're going to go up to $80 million. So incrementally, it's about $20 million. On the flash revenue, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of an incremental point. And as I just finished commenting on, as we start to ramp volumes, and we are, we'll start to absorb those costs. And I think we'll definitely see that number coming down in the couple of quarters following the September quarter. So I think we're in good shape there. \n And then in terms of volumes on the hard drive side, I mean, we're -- we definitely have plans to produce over 1 million units of 18- and 16-terabyte product. And we'll get as many of those out the door as we can this quarter. Thanks, everyone."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements, including product development expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release, and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. I would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon, and I hope that you and your families are well given the COVID-19 pandemic we are all facing.I joined Western Digital a little over a month ago because I have strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company and how all of us live our daily lives. This transition will continue to rapidly increase the amount of data generated, stored and consumed in the world.Western Digital is uniquely positioned to accelerate and benefit from this transformation as the only company providing a broader array of NAND flash, SSD and HDD solutions. We have a strong portfolio, established footprint, operational scale, brand and great customer relationships from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. On today's call, we'll discuss what we're doing to position the company for continued success and to be best prepared to capture the significant opportunities in front of us.While I couldn't have anticipated the unprecedented series of events that have transpired since I joined the company on March 9, I do believe that the underpinnings of the technology architecture we are all now leveraging on a daily basis has been well established over the past several years. The public cloud rapidly accelerating innovation across a wide array of increasingly intelligent devices, all brought together by high-speed networks.All elements of this architecture are continually upgraded, new cloud APIs, new and more powerful edge and endpoint capabilities and emerging 5G networks. Increased capabilities across any point of this architecture drive incremental opportunity for all that participate in the ecosystem.Data is the critical component that unlocks value across this ecosystem, and our portfolio is well positioned from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. I'm confident our team's innovation in NAND and HDD technologies will drive significant new opportunity for our customers and value for our shareholders. As you can probably tell, I'm excited to be here and see great opportunities for Western Digital.Before we review our results for the third quarter, I would like to address how we are operating amid the COVID-19 pandemic. First and foremost, our priority is to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and suppliers. We are carefully following precautionary measures and best practices across our global sites and all production facilities remain operational.We encountered some supply disruptions in the quarter. However, due to the efforts of our operations team, we saw supply trends improve as the quarter progressed. We also incurred additional costs associated with logistics and other manufacturing activity.Demand remained strong in the third quarter as expected. Revenue was $4.2 billion, right at the midpoint of the guidance provided in January.We experienced healthy demand from our major cloud customers throughout the quarter and maintained our leading position in the capacity enterprise drive category. The current environment has accelerated the movement to the cloud, transforming the way businesses operate, students learn, and the way friends and families connect. These trends will continue to drive innovation and data storage growth for a number of years, and we are well positioned.High-capacity hard drives are the foundation to enabling the world's essential zettabyte scale data infrastructure, providing unmatched capacity and TCO efficiency. Our 14-terabyte products continued to perform well, and industry analysts expect this capacity point to remain the industry's highest volume drive, at least through the third quarter of calendar 2020.We are leading the industry in bringing next-generation energy-assisted drives to market as we recognize revenue for our 16- and 18-terabyte drives during the quarter. Customer interest in these products, specifically our 18-terabyte drive is very high and the ramp is on schedule.Customer acceptance of our enterprise SSDs continue to grow. Our latest 96-layer NVMe-based SSDs have completed more than 20 qualifications with well over 100 qualifications in progress at multiple cloud and OEM customers worldwide.Demand for our notebook solutions was greater than expected due to the shift to working from home and e-learning. We experienced record client SSD revenue during the quarter and expect continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.Desktop hard drive revenue was down due to normal seasonality and a shift towards mobile notebook solutions. In addition, smart video hard drive demand was softer than expected as a result of COVID-19.Mobile flash bit shipments remained modest in the quarter, as we strategically managed our exposure to this part of the market. Retail was particularly affected by COVID-19 in a typically seasonally weaker quarter. As we approached the end of the quarter, we experienced a decline in demand from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they started to temporarily close their stores. While many retailers shifted to curbside pickup and began pushing sales through their online channels, we expect physical store closures will create a headwind in our fiscal fourth quarter.Finally, new game consoles are expected to come to market shortly that are reimagining the next-generation of gaming. These new platforms not only utilize nearly one terabit of - terabyte of internal flash storage, but also empower new cloud-based services for gamers, streamers and content creators that will drive incremental cloud storage demand. We remain on track to ship into this new and growing part of the market in the coming quarter.Turning our outlook for the fourth quarter. Demand remains strong, and we expect growth in revenue and profitability. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a very dynamic environment for us to manage, but our teams are performing well. Bob will go through the details of our Q4 guidance.I am convinced that Western Digital will play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation underway. The combination of right products, customer engagement and end markets focus provides tremendous opportunities for us.Flash holds the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital. As I mentioned previously, the migration to flash within gaming consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support a new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that will enable a multiyear growth opportunity.In hard drives, we have already aligned our portfolio to capitalize on long-term growth areas. Our technology and products are indispensable to the growth of the public cloud, the seminal technology trend of our era. We are the first to market with next-generation energy-assisted drives, and we will continue to deliver new innovations to build upon our aerial density leadership.I joined Western Digital to be at the center of this incredible opportunity, innovating in one of the critical building blocks of the digital world, storage. Given the breadth and strength of our portfolio and the attractive markets we operate in, we need to best position the company for ongoing success.As a result, we have made the decision to suspend our dividend in order to reinvest in the business and support our deleveraging efforts. Bob will go into more details on our deleveraging objectives.Before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire Western Digital team, who have come together during this challenging time. It's been incredible to see the support, teamwork and leadership displayed across all levels. Together, I am confident we will get through this and emerge stronger than before.I will now ask Bob to share our financial highlights.\nRobert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and welcome to Western Digital. As Dave mentioned, the world has changed in the last few months. I'm impressed by how well the Western Digital team has come together and navigated through this challenging quarter. Results in the fiscal third quarter were generally in line with the guidance provided in January as demand held up well in most of our end markets. We had COVID-19-related impacts, which I will detail in a few minutes.Revenue was $4.2 billion, down 1% sequentially and up 14% from a year ago. By end market, Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 2% on a sequential basis and increased 13% year-over-year. Record client SSD revenue drove most of the sequential and year-over-year growth. As we look into the fiscal fourth quarter, we anticipate client SSD will experience another strong quarter of revenue growth.Notebook and PC-related hard drive revenue declined and now represents under 20% of our total HDD revenue. Smart video was a bit weaker than expected, primarily due to COVID-19.And finally, while mobile was up sequentially and year-over-year, we remain under-indexed to this part of the market. Data center devices and solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was up 2% sequentially and up nearly 22% year-over-year. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was flat on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew.Client Solutions revenue was $821 million, down 13% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Our retail business was impacted as we approached the end of the quarter due to COVID-19-related lockdown. These lockdowns will have an impact on our fiscal fourth quarter.Demand remains strong in our end markets as we look into the fiscal fourth quarter. Growth in client devices and data center devices and solutions should more than offset the decline in client solutions.By product category, flash revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 5% sequentially and bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. As we look into the fiscal fourth quarter demand for our flash-based solutions remains strong, and we anticipate that flash prices will rise on a sequential basis.Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 12% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $85, and exabyte shipments were down 6%.As we move on to cost and expenses, please note, all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise with COVID-19 impacts detailed where appropriate.Gross margin for the third quarter was up two percentage points sequentially to 27.9%. The start-up costs of our fab in Kitakami, K1, were $62 million and the COVID-19-related costs in the quarter were $13 million. For clarity, both items are included in the reported non-GAAP gross margin. The COVID-19 costs were primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics and other costs.Our flash gross margin was 26.5%, up seven percentage points from last quarter due to a stronger pricing environment and cost reductions. In the quarter, we began to ship production units out of K1.The hard drive gross margin declined to 29.3% from 30.8% in the prior quarter, mostly due to the COVID-19 impact and mix shifts.Operating expenses were $738 million, slightly lower than expected. Other income and expense was $91 million, higher than expected due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. The tax rate came in at 23.5% in the quarter, which was lower than our prior range of 25% to 27% for the full year.We now estimate our fiscal year 2020 tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. Earnings per share was $0.85. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $142 million, and free cash flow was $176 million. Our free cash flow was better than expected in a quarter that is usually seasonally low. So far, in fiscal 2020, we have generated $847 million in free cash flow and expect to generate very good cash flow in the fourth quarter.Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $34 million due to the timing of funds flowing back and forth to the joint venture. For the full fiscal year, we expect cash, capital expenditures to be an inflow of a couple hundred million dollars.Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion this fiscal year. We are assessing our fiscal 2021 capital expenditures based on the current economic environment.Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.8 billion. In the fiscal third quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders and made an optional $150 million debt paydown. Fiscal year-to-date, we've lowered our debt by about $920 million.Our first priority for cash utilization is to reinvest in the business. Since we are suspending our dividend, our second priority is repayment of debt. Our current plan is to reevaluate the dividend and other shareholder return policies, and our total debt is under $6 billion and our net debt is under $3 billion. Our goal through a cycle is to have a growth leverage in the range of one to 3.5 times EBITDA. Our current debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 5.0 times in the third quarter.I want to make it clear, suspending the dividend is not related to our debt covenants. We have substantial room under our covenants.Moving on to non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.45 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 29% and 31%. This range includes approximately $65 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. We're also anticipating the impact of COVID-19.Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the guidance range assumes normal variable compensation expense. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $75 million and $80 million. The tax rate should be between 24% and 25%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $1 and $1.40, assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares. We're using a wider range this quarter, primarily due to the uncertainty in the environment.With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: It's Aaron Rakers from Wells. Maybe I'll start with just asking about it. I think on Slide eight in the prior presentation, you guys gave some commentary around the outlook that you have for the flash business as far as industry supply bit growth, as well as your expectation, I think previously noting that you'd expected mid-30% growth on enterprise, high-capacity nearline drive shipments for the full year.And on the second point, can you just - it looks like you definitely kind of underperformed some of your peers on nearline. Just if you could help us understand what you're seeing in that market relative to the performance we've seen out of your competitors?\nDavid Goeckeler: So the first question, I missed part of it, but it sounded like that was on aligning a supply and demand of bit growth in the second half of the year. So look, I mean, let me start out with what we're seeing right now. I mean, we saw good demand. We saw, as Bob talked about, margins up this quarter.We're - next quarter was, as we expected and as we guided, margins up again. Obviously, as we get into the second half of the year, things get a little more difficult to really project. I think we're looking at various different recovery scenarios and how we will invest in those, and we'll be prudent about how we do that.On the nearline side, I mean, look, we're happy with where the product performed. The 14-terabyte is still performing well. 18-terabyte shipped for revenue this quarter, as we talked about. That we made that commitment, we delivered on that. The ramp is on schedule. We see great interest from that. There's no doubt we're in a little bit of a product transition in the industry, and that will play out over the next couple of quarters, but we're happy with where the portfolio is. Bob, do you have anything to add?\nRobert Eulau: No, I think that's a good summary. I mean, we're ramping as planned.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then, Bob, just as a quick follow-up, if I can. I know you mentioned that you've got an ample amount of room as far as your covenants. At 5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, can you just remind us again what those covenants are? What the thresholds look like? I think it was a little bit lower than that. So just refresh us again on the covenants and when maybe covenants change going forward?\nRobert Eulau: Yes. So the covenants are related to an adjusted EBITDA number that we use for compliance purposes. And so that the ratio is well below the five we show as a non-GAAP debt-to-EBITDA number. And we, as you saw, made progress in the quarter. Our gross leverage went from 5.7 to 5.0 this quarter. So we're definitely trending in the right direction. And as I said, we have plenty of room under the covenant. We just haven't given a lot of specifics on the actual compliance covenant.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. That is it. Thanks.\nRobert Eulau: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. If you could talk about the decision around the dividend, and we've highlighted this is something you should consider. But I just curious how much of it is the current environment and the uncertainties around COVID-19 versus just coming in as a new CEO and wanting to get to these leverage targets before you start paying cash out?\nDavid Goeckeler: You know, like anything, I think it's a combination of a lot of things. But certainly, the current situation, bring some focus to the desire to deleverage a little faster. But the real issue - and of course, the real issue is I come into the business, and the company is really well positioned. When I think - I talked about it in my remarks, when I think about the technology trends that are going on right now, I mean, it's happening in the cloud. Obviously, everybody knows that public cloud is a huge transition. We continue to see incredible growth, and we will. We can talk about that for a long time. We're very well positioned in that market. We perform in the fourth quarter. We'll see the hard drive market of the - the portfolio has been repositioned for that capacity - hard drive capacity enterprise market, and we'll see - actually see that market return to growth after several years of kind of decline and maybe going sideways a little bit.So we're very well indexed to what I think is one of the biggest technology trends we've seen in a very, very long time. And as that continues, that's going to be good for our portfolio. And then we have the flash portfolio, which if you look at the edge, we have just new markets coming online all the time, where we've talked about gaming, and we see VR headsets, all kinds of things are going to drive demand in that side of the market as well. So we're playing - the portfolio is very well positioned, and we have lots of opportunities to invest in the growth of the business. And when I think - when you put that all together, it was the right time to move on to a different model.\nJoe Moore: Great. And then as a follow-up. If you could assess the current environment, we see a fair amount of tightness, particularly on enterprise-grade NAND. How much of that do you think is just tight supply/demand of raw NAND versus tighter supply of PCB controllers, things like that? It seems like it's a combination of both. Do you still think that the underlying NAND market is pretty healthy?\nRobert Eulau: Yes. We're still very bullish on the enterprise SSD market. And as you know, Joe, we've got goals to get up to 20% market share there. In the short term, you're right, it's a matter of balancing and making sure we've got the right controllers to go with the NAND for that market. And so that's probably the controller side is more of a challenge than the NAND side, but we're very, very optimistic on that business.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Hi, good afternoon and welcome to the team Dave. Two questions if I may.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Karl.\nKarl Ackerman: Two questions, if I may. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more clarity on when we should expect the volumes of your 16- and 18-terabyte drives to cross over your 14-terabyte drives? I can appreciate your conservatism given limited use of the second half, but should we actually see the 18-terabyte time line accelerate given robust data center demand?\nDavid Goeckeler: Karl, I think one of the things you're going to see from me is I'm going to really focus on forecasting one quarter at a time. So it's not going to happen next quarter, but you knew that. I think we're looking several quarters out, I guess, is what I'll say at this point. I think - will it accelerate given the increased cloud demand we're seeing? We're seeing a lot of demand for that product already. I don't think it's going to accelerate one way or another based on if that demand - I mean, we're basically going to - we have the demand we need to ramp the product. So we're looking forward to it being a great launch now, and the team is very focused on continuing to make supply available, but we're excited about the product.\nKarl Ackerman: Thanks. And as a follow-up, if I may. Are you capacity constrained on nearline today? And in NAND, while it's probably difficult to ascertain what your customers' inventory levels are, has NAND inventory on your own balance sheet declined on a days basis in March? And any thoughts on how that could trend in the June quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Why don't you take the inventory question?\nRobert Eulau: Yes. I can start with the inventory question. So our inventories were up just slightly this quarter. I actually think in the next quarter, you'll see inventories coming down quite a bit because of some of the supply chain challenges. But I'd say everything seems to be an equilibrium in general.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I would say the same thing about the supply. Are we supply constrained? I think the balance is what we expected at this point, right? We continue to see strong demand there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So I have two questions. First one is on the gross margin guide being 29% to 31% on a GAAP basis, I know there is a number of moving parts there. I think, you talked about NAND prices going up. Can you just help us build the bridge between where you were in fiscal Q3 where there's a bunch of expenses included? And how that gets to fiscal Q4?\nRobert Eulau: Yes. So Sidney, this is Bob. I'll take that. So the - actually, we probably have more absorption variance and cost headwinds in the fourth fiscal quarter than we had in the third. And we are trying to move prices up where we can in the market as a result of those incremental costs. So it's absorption, it's logistics costs, it's other costs and making sure the environments are safe around the world. So it's actually a bigger challenge in the fourth quarter.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Maybe my follow-up question is, you lowered your gross cash CapEx to $1.7 billion from - I think last quarter, you said $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Just trying to figure out what has changed there in terms of the CapEx plans? I understand for next year, you guys are not ready to give a guidance. But just maybe qualitatively or directionally, how are you thinking about tech migration, wafer capacity additions, those kind of things would be great? Thank you.\nRobert Eulau: Yeah. So without talking too much about the specific number, as you know, this was always anticipated to be a low growth CapEx year for us. Because if you go back a year ago, we were reducing the amount of capacity we had. We actually took some off-line about a year ago, as you'll recall. And then along with our partner, we had pushed out some of the CapEx expectations. So we'd always expected this to be a light year. And I still expect CapEx will be up next year. I'm not ready at this point to say how much that will be.\nSidney Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to your hard disk drive. You spoke last few years. It seems like you and your competitor are skipping a node. Your competitor may have gained some market share in 16 terabyte, and now you are aggressively qualifying 18. And this has been a pattern for the past two years. How should we think about this looking forward, especially as areal density is going to hit the ceiling? Is there any update on your strategy?And in that context, my follow-up question for David is, this is the first time that you have the mic, if you could please tell us how do you see the company moving forward? And what are the key strategies that you're employing? I understand that you've been on board for probably maybe one or two months, but both NAND and hard disk drives are very dynamic. Things changes on a monthly, quarterly basis. To the extent that you can share with us your long-term vision and your strategy would be very helpful? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. So on the - thanks, Mehdi. On the first question, you're right, we are in a product transition, and we are excited about the 18-terabyte drive. I'm not yet an expert on hard drive areal density, but I've come up to speed on it relatively quickly. I mean, you're right, it's getting harder and harder to drive more density but we have an enormous amount of R&D in this area. And we're going to invest aggressively to make sure we maintain our lead in areal density.And I think you'll hear more from us coming up about that. There's lots of things going on as there always is and in R&D organizations, and that's been one of the things that has not been surprising to me when I came in, but it's great to see is just the depth of talent that's in the organization to drive the road map in that critical technology.And like I said - I mean, this is - when I look at the strategy of the company - I mean, we will have more to say about this in the future. But when I look at this coming in, I think the company is very well positioned in the fact that it made the pivot to flash. And the way I look at the world is how it evolves as you've got this.We're in like almost - it's kind of almost clich\u00e9 to say it about this unprecedented amount of technological change and always seems to be going faster. But I mean, really, over the last number of years, the change that the cloud and the public cloud is driven and the amount of technological change its pushing on every industry and every company is just astounding. There's lots of reasons for that. And many ways is democratizing the access to the most sophisticated technology, everybody can have it now through an API call. And that's just causing just a huge wave of investment and technological change and advancement for every company, every industry for all of us.Our portfolio is very well positioned to support. We provide one of the key building blocks or fundamental elements of that digital world, storage. And I think in the cloud and our leadership in areal density, we are very, very highly correlated to that growth vector in the industry. But not just that, it's also - on the flash side, you've got the edge and endpoints and what's happening there and they're becoming more sophisticated networks, which is something I'm pretty familiar with, giving my history.Networks are getting faster, that's enabling a lot more higher - much more capable end points to be interconnected, that's driving the flash side of the business. We talked about this in the prepared remarks. Just look at the gaming market, all of a sudden becomes - opens up to this - there's a new market that just opens up to us. And there will be more and more of those happening. And then these two things reinforce each other.The more innovation there is at the edge, on the endpoints, it drives more data, more data that needs to be stored, more data that needs to be processed, insights need to be derived from it. And that becomes kind of this virtuous cycle that happens. And I think the company is very well positioned on both sides of that.So we'll have more to say on how we zero in on that. You're right, it is a very dynamic market. It's very sensitive to supply and demand changes, but the general trajectory is a good one. We're in a good market. It's always great to be in great TAMs that are growing. As I said, even the hard drive business, which is - we've now - I say we, the team here has repositioned the portfolio around capacity enterprise, and you're seeing the growth now come back to that technology base, which is great to see.So look, I'll stop there. We'll have - I'll have more to say in the future. But as I said, I'm super happy to be here. I think it's - I think what this company provides is incredibly fundamental and critical for the world that we're all going to, and we use every day. So - and we'll dial that even more - dial that in more as we go forward. So thanks for the question. I really appreciate it.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins. Can you repeat what the K1 charges are in the June quarter? And how you see that progressing through the rest of the calendar year? And then, can you also share with us what COVID expenses you're assuming? And I'm assuming, again, that's all mostly HDD related. And is that something that we should be thinking about as we model out into the back half of the year?\nRobert Eulau: Yes. This is Bob. I'll take a cut at this, C.J. I believe I said the K1 costs were at $62 million in the current quarter and guided to around $65 million next quarter. I think that will be roughly the level through the rest of the calendar year, and then you should start to see it drop off pretty quickly next year as volume starts to ramp more. So I think that's kind of the way we're seeing it right now.In terms of COVID-19, we aren't going to get specific in terms of the cost. As I mentioned, we'll have more absorption variances this quarter. We'll also have more logistics costs this quarter and a number of other costs. We're going to be able to partially offset that with pricing. And our customers will share in some of that, but we're still net-net, going to have some headwind there for COVID-19. But I don't want to get too detailed on that because it's just too hard to tell how it will actually play out.\nC.J. Muse: Sure. Very helpful. I guess my follow-up question. How are you thinking about managing your bit inventory on the NAND side in terms of, clearly, some of the lack of visibility, uncertainty associated with COVID-19? And so I guess, would love to hear your thoughts on how you're managing the wafers? And as part of that, what kind of visibility do you have to the second half for cloud spending to be sustainable? Thanks so much.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. So C.J., as you know, we're just guiding one quarter out right now. As you can imagine, probably like every company, we have multiple scenarios that we're evaluating. As I said, we think inventory is roughly in equilibrium right now. And we'll just have to take it one quarter at a time as we move forward. So far, demand has held out pretty well for us, and we'll just have to see how that continues through the year. But I don't see major changes right now.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, C.J.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. First one, again, on gross margins in the NAND business. Very nice expansion in the March quarter. 90 days ago, you guys talked about gross margins potentially being in the 35% to 40% range in the back half of the year.Again, I appreciate you guys aren't guiding for the full year, but is that still the right appropriate range? Or have things evolved given COVID-19 and its ramifications?\nDavid Goeckeler: So you got it right that we're going to stick to one quarter at a time. But I mean, they're going in the right direction. I mean, the fact - I mean, we - the forecast for next quarter is the forecast for next quarter. We feel good about where the demand is. As Bob said, I think I mentioned it before as well, we're looking at all different kinds of scenarios for the second half of the year. And as we get more information, we'll make decisions about our investment portfolio to support that.So it's not surprising. I think everybody sees the same thing right now. Visibility is a little bit difficult, but it's - we'll see how it goes week-by-week as we go through the quarter.\nToshiya Hari: Understood. And then as a quick follow-up, kind of a follow-up question to Mehdi's question earlier. David, I appreciate you've only been around for a month plus here. But I was hoping you could share maybe one or two things that you'd like to change or improve upon at the company? In response to Mehdi's question, I think you talked about being comfortable with the portfolio and having the confidence in sort of the growth profile of the company.But how about from an operational standpoint? Any one or two things that you hope to change or improve upon, I guess, as an add-on to that? If you had to pick one or two kind of financial metrics that you tend to focus on and prioritize, if you can kind of speak to those, that would be helpful, whether it'd be revenue or margins, EPS, cash flow? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Toshi, I mean, I think it's - I appreciate the question. I guess I'll say in general, it's a difficult quarter to draw lots of long-term conclusions about much of anything right now. The - I will say, the operations team has just done an incredible job. I mean, I've watched this play out now over the last seven weeks or so that I've been here.And we have a global footprint with factories and fabs all over the world, China, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, here in the U.S. And to see how all the best practices have been shared, and all of those have been kept open and functioning at some level and then increasing capabilities, working with our suppliers, I think that's a tremendous strength of the company.Again, I have more to say about that later. But again, I think this - the past seven weeks is not a time where you want to look at anything and draw a really long-term conclusion given the dynamic situation we're in.As far as financial metrics, there is lots of good ones. Clearly, gross margin is something we're going to be very focused on, making sure we're investing our resources in the places that can draw the highest return. That is obviously a very big focus and cash generation, quite honestly, and make sure we're managing for that. So those are two that are at the top of a whole long list.\nToshiya Hari: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nMike Cadiz: Hi, good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz for Jim Suva at Citi. Gentlemen, would you mind giving us a little more color, please, on the current factory utilization levels? And secondly, an overview on the health of your component supply chain at this time? I appreciate it. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think that it's been improving week over week. And as it stands right now, we're in good shape. Obviously, it's an incredibly dynamic situation. I'll say that right from the start. I mean, every day, it changes. And every day, of course, you get new information and make the best decision about how you're going to move forward, but the team has done a great job of that, kept things open the whole time.Literally, over the past two or three weeks, things have gotten significantly stronger, and it puts us in a position right now where I think we're - I don't want to use the term normal because I don't think anything is normal in the world right now, but we're operating at a level that - I mean, obviously, we're operating at a level that can support the forecast that we just put forward.So I feel really good about what the team has done and the position they've put us in around the world. And we're staying super vigilant to make sure, one, that we implement best practices across all of our facilities.We are working from home at a significant level everywhere we can, and that's making the situation better. But the people that have to come in to keep the businesses running. And as you know, we are an essential business. And everywhere we operate, that hasn't been an issue about getting any kind of authorization to operate, but making sure that the people that are in, the facilities are safe, and we've had good success there as well.Our supply chain, we've been working with our supply chain. We've been helping out our supply chain to make sure they get the appropriate government release to continue to operate. We've been doing some diversification of that to fill some gaps and some non-regrets moves on that. But right now, the supply chain, again, it's the same thing as our own facilities. It's - week by week, it's gotten better to a point where right now we feel like we're in a relatively strong position.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. I mean, where all vendors producing at this point, and that could change when everybody's producing it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMitch Steves: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two couple of small ones, I guess. So the first one just regard to the dividend and kind of cancellation there. So what type of leverage metric are you guys trying to get to? Or is there any sort of way to think about when it will be reinstated in terms of a financial metric?And then secondly, just given the supply chain disruptions of what we're seeing in economic wide disruptions, what's the new view in terms of what you guys believe smartphone units will look like out, call it, 12 to 24 months, whatever time frame you want to use?\nRobert Eulau: All right. Mitch, it's Bob. I'll start. One of the things we've done is we've studied the capital structure quite a bit. And what we've concluded is, obviously, it's a cyclical business. We want to have a growth leverage that works for us through the cycle. We're expecting, as we bring our debt levels down, that we'll manage to anywhere from one to 3.5 times EBITDA depending on where we are in the cycle. And as I mentioned, the goal is to get our gross debt down to about $6 billion and our net debt to $3 billion. And yes, I don't know if you want to take.\nDavid Goeckeler: First of all, hey, Mitch. How are you doing? Thanks for the question. I don't think we forecast smartphone units. I mean, again, the second half and what's going to happen. We're going to take it quarter-by-quarter at this point. We - obviously, we feel good about our guide for the next quarter and what we see on the supply and demand side to have a lot of confidence in that. And we'll have more to say about the second half next quarter.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. The thing I would add, as you recall, Mitch, I mean, we're under-indexed to the mobile phone market. So we're not trying to forecast it, and we're not as exposed to it as some of our customers - I'm sorry, some of our competitors.\nMitch Steves: Understood. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Mitch.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. I just had a question on the retail channel. You mentioned there's - obviously, there's a pretty big disruption in the channel right now. Can you talk about, one, how it impacted the guidance for the current quarter?And then secondly, when we think about sort of those brands, which are pretty strong in retail league, Western Digital and the old SanDisk products, you're sort of focus on those longer-term given that you could probably redeploy those bits and heads and media into more profitable areas? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: So I think as we talked about for the fourth quarter, we expect some headwinds in that business. I think it's typically a seasonally weak quarter anyway. And obviously, with stores not being open, it makes it a lot tougher. Last quarter, as we talked about towards the end of the quarter, we obviously saw a deterioration as stores were closed. And we also saw the mix shift to lower-margin products as well.We've got that all factored into the guide. I mean - again, we're very comfortable with the guide. The guide is a guide. And so we've got all the dynamics that we expect to happen in the retail channel baked into those numbers.Longer term, again, we'll have more to say about longer-term strategy. But I think it's a great strength of the company, those brands. I think it's an area where we can drive differentiation and we can drive margin in those channels as well. They're not just - it's not just all low-margin business.So I feel good about that capability. And honestly, it's one of the things that attracted me to the company. So we'll - again, we'll have more to say about what the long-term strategy is there, but I think it's definitely an asset.\nSteven Fox: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck going forward.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Dave, I guess, I'm trying to understand the current demand is sustainable, I guess, into the second half. I guess we are all trying to do that at this point. But what I'm trying to get at is that you guys tend to have pretty good visibility on the hyperscale cloud side given your design cycles.I just want to hear your thoughts as to what your customers are saying about the second half? And what sort of design activity on the drive side you're seeing? Any thoughts would be helpful?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Again, I always couch everything we're going to guide one quarter at a time, but it's a fair question. I mean, we - I guess the only thing we can say is we continue to see strong demand from the big cloud vendors, cloud suppliers. There's always a question, are they building inventory, are they buying ahead, the old consumption digestion kind of thing. Everything we see is there's strong demand for what their products are. I think they're saying the same thing. Not saying anything new there.How long it lasts? I mean, what I talked about in the intro of - in my prepared remarks, I mean, I think this world that we're all living in because of COVID-19, where there's just a lot more work at home, learn at home, there's just a lot more dependence on cloud and endpoint technology, I think that architecture has been set for some time now, and it's impacting every business. We've seen a massive acceleration to that, unfortunately, because of a global pandemic.The question is how much - is that going to continue to stay as it starts to subside? I don't - obviously, there'll be some variability in that given that there's so many people at home now. But like I said, I think the model is set, and I think it's how fast we're going to get there. I don't think there's a question on is it the right destination? So we'll see as we move into the second half.Our conversations with all those customers continue to be fantastic, you're right. One of the things that's been great as I've come into this company, is just to understand the depth of our relationship and the strength of our footprint and those customers is extremely impressive.And so we're going to stay very close to them and continue to work with them as they build out their infrastructure. But right now, I don't think - we don't have any sign that - well, I think what we're seeing is the increased demand and nothing tells us that it's nothing but real demand. And how far it extends into the second half, we'll see as we get more visibility.\nSrini Pajjuri: Helpful. Thank you. And then, Bob, I guess, as you try to improve the free cash flow going forward, a couple of line items, I want to hear your thoughts on. First, on the OpEx. And then the other thing I noticed is that you've been paying a fairly high tax rate, relatively speaking, at least on a non-GAAP basis compared to your semi peers. I'm just curious as to why that is? And when do you expect that to come down? Thank you.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. So two good questions. OpEx, I think the best assumption is it will be around the levels we guided to this quarter for the next few quarters anyway.On the tax rate, the dilemma is we have a fantastic structure when we're making more money than we are right now. And so right now, when our profitability levels are relatively low, we have certain minimum taxes we have to pay around the world and it makes our tax rate quite high. So it will come down as the overall profitability starts to come up.\nSrini Pajjuri: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like the team saw continued strong growth in the ramp of your new enterprise SSD platforms. I know you guys are targeting 20% market share. But based on your shipments in the March quarter and assumption on industry shipments, did you guys actually achieve double-digit percentage market share in the March quarter?\nRobert Eulau: Yes. I'd say the share was fairly flat. That market is growing quite a bit. So we're - as I mentioned earlier, we're a bit constrained on controllers right now, but the demand is definitely there.\nHarlan Sur: Okay. Great. And then on the COVID-19 operational issues, team, maybe just give us a bit more color on where these are coming from? I know that you guys - there are shelter-in-place and movement control in the Bay Area, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, all of the areas where you guys have a footprint of operations. Any geographies, which are creating more of a pressure point from an operational or a logistics perspective? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: I don't really want to call out any one area over another because it -one, it changes quite a bit based on local situations. But obviously, if - there's a couple of different categories things fall in to. First is logistics. It's gotten more expensive to get to move stuff around. A lot of stuff went on domestic flight. So there's a lot or passenger flights. There's a lot fewer of those. So those costs are going up. Just the general number of places that are open and how difficult it is to move things around is a big category of cost.And then in places where we maybe do have a little bit of under - we can't run at full capacity, although that's getting to be less and less of an issue over the last couple of weeks there's some absorption costs that Bob talked about. And then there's some just general costs of just increased cleaning and those kinds of things. But those are relatively minor based on the other two. I don't know, Bob, anything else come to mind?\nRobert Eulau: No, I think that's right. I mean, I think certainly, May will be better than April, and I think June will be even a little better than May.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. It really has been a week over week. It's gotten much better.\nHarlan Sur: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Please go ahead.\nTristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. We've been reading recently about HDD pricing going up to match higher logistical costs. What's your sense of pricing in HDD going forward? And will the supply disruption create potentially an environment where pricing could be favorable for the next few quarters?\nDavid Goeckeler: Oh, I don't know about for the next few quarters. But we have been somewhat successful in moving pricing to cover some of the increased costs. I think that's what our focus is on anything around pricing in the industry. But we're not looking at it. We're looking at it in the sense of what it takes to cover the increased costs that we have in the business. And we have a good idea what those are going to be for next quarter. And when we get there, we'll figure out what's going to happen in that. Bob, anything to add to that?\nRobert Eulau: No, I agree.\nTristan Gerra: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You've talked a lot about supply chain disruptions, but - and how this has improved recently. But is there a quantification that you could put into maybe a percentage of output that's currently for this current quarter going to be impacted by those disruptions? I know that you've talked about your expectation for inventory levels to come down. Just trying to put things together in terms of whether there is still a meaningful impact - material impact on the supply coming from those disruptions this quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I don't want to put a specific number on it because the potential - it's a very - as I said - said several times, a very dynamic environment. I would say that we have confidence in the supply - what the supply that's going to be produced to support the guide for the next quarter. We have a lot of confidence in that. But it could - things change every day. But I said the trend has been going - it's been getting better and better to where it's given us the confidence to put the guide in place that we have.\nTristan Gerra: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital before we end with a short statement by our CEO. Please go ahead.\nWeston Twigg: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of quick ones. First, I was just wondering if you had a chance to look at the recent commerce rule change regarding company military exposure in China, Russia and Venezuela. I think specifically in China, you had previously said you have 20% to 25% exposure. And I'm wondering if you had a chance to think about how much of that might fall under the new definition under this rule?\nDavid Goeckeler: We've had a chance to take a quick look at it. And we don't believe it will have a material impact on our business. But obviously, we're going to monitor it very, very closely.\nWeston Twigg: That makes sense. That's helpful. And then the other question I had was just on notebooks. It's been a big driver of near-term revenue. Can you talk about the density trends in notebooks in the back half of the year if that might be - I don't know if it's stable or going up or not, but if that might be an offset if units are down?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Again, we're going to stick to talking about things for next quarter. I don't have anything in particularly insightful to say about density trends and notebooks at this point. Bob, I don't know if you do.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. No, I don't. I mean, obviously, it's come up over the last year, but I think as we go forward, we don't really know.\nDavid Goeckeler: We can follow-up with you with some more details.\nWeston Twigg: All right. Sounds good. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Weston.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right. Thank all of you for joining us here today. We look forward to seeing you virtually at the upcoming JPMorgan and Bank of America conferences. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. I would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon, and I hope that you and your families are well given the COVID-19 pandemic we are all facing.I joined Western Digital a little over a month ago because I have strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company and how all of us live our daily lives. This transition will continue to rapidly increase the amount of data generated, stored and consumed in the world.Western Digital is uniquely positioned to accelerate and benefit from this transformation as the only company providing a broader array of NAND flash, SSD and HDD solutions. We have a strong portfolio, established footprint, operational scale, brand and great customer relationships from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. On today's call, we'll discuss what we're doing to position the company for continued success and to be best prepared to capture the significant opportunities in front of us.While I couldn't have anticipated the unprecedented series of events that have transpired since I joined the company on March 9, I do believe that the underpinnings of the technology architecture we are all now leveraging on a daily basis has been well established over the past several years. The public cloud rapidly accelerating innovation across a wide array of increasingly intelligent devices, all brought together by high-speed networks.All elements of this architecture are continually upgraded, new cloud APIs, new and more powerful edge and endpoint capabilities and emerging 5G networks. Increased capabilities across any point of this architecture drive incremental opportunity for all that participate in the ecosystem.Data is the critical component that unlocks value across this ecosystem, and our portfolio is well positioned from the cloud to the edge to the endpoint. I'm confident our team's innovation in NAND and HDD technologies will drive significant new opportunity for our customers and value for our shareholders. As you can probably tell, I'm excited to be here and see great opportunities for Western Digital.Before we review our results for the third quarter, I would like to address how we are operating amid the COVID-19 pandemic. First and foremost, our priority is to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and suppliers. We are carefully following precautionary measures and best practices across our global sites and all production facilities remain operational.We encountered some supply disruptions in the quarter. However, due to the efforts of our operations team, we saw supply trends improve as the quarter progressed. We also incurred additional costs associated with logistics and other manufacturing activity.Demand remained strong in the third quarter as expected. Revenue was $4.2 billion, right at the midpoint of the guidance provided in January.We experienced healthy demand from our major cloud customers throughout the quarter and maintained our leading position in the capacity enterprise drive category. The current environment has accelerated the movement to the cloud, transforming the way businesses operate, students learn, and the way friends and families connect. These trends will continue to drive innovation and data storage growth for a number of years, and we are well positioned.High-capacity hard drives are the foundation to enabling the world's essential zettabyte scale data infrastructure, providing unmatched capacity and TCO efficiency. Our 14-terabyte products continued to perform well, and industry analysts expect this capacity point to remain the industry's highest volume drive, at least through the third quarter of calendar 2020.We are leading the industry in bringing next-generation energy-assisted drives to market as we recognize revenue for our 16- and 18-terabyte drives during the quarter. Customer interest in these products, specifically our 18-terabyte drive is very high and the ramp is on schedule.Customer acceptance of our enterprise SSDs continue to grow. Our latest 96-layer NVMe-based SSDs have completed more than 20 qualifications with well over 100 qualifications in progress at multiple cloud and OEM customers worldwide.Demand for our notebook solutions was greater than expected due to the shift to working from home and e-learning. We experienced record client SSD revenue during the quarter and expect continued growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.Desktop hard drive revenue was down due to normal seasonality and a shift towards mobile notebook solutions. In addition, smart video hard drive demand was softer than expected as a result of COVID-19.Mobile flash bit shipments remained modest in the quarter, as we strategically managed our exposure to this part of the market. Retail was particularly affected by COVID-19 in a typically seasonally weaker quarter. As we approached the end of the quarter, we experienced a decline in demand from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they started to temporarily close their stores. While many retailers shifted to curbside pickup and began pushing sales through their online channels, we expect physical store closures will create a headwind in our fiscal fourth quarter.Finally, new game consoles are expected to come to market shortly that are reimagining the next-generation of gaming. These new platforms not only utilize nearly one terabit of - terabyte of internal flash storage, but also empower new cloud-based services for gamers, streamers and content creators that will drive incremental cloud storage demand. We remain on track to ship into this new and growing part of the market in the coming quarter.Turning our outlook for the fourth quarter. Demand remains strong, and we expect growth in revenue and profitability. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create a very dynamic environment for us to manage, but our teams are performing well. Bob will go through the details of our Q4 guidance.I am convinced that Western Digital will play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation underway. The combination of right products, customer engagement and end markets focus provides tremendous opportunities for us.Flash holds the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital. As I mentioned previously, the migration to flash within gaming consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support a new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that will enable a multiyear growth opportunity.In hard drives, we have already aligned our portfolio to capitalize on long-term growth areas. Our technology and products are indispensable to the growth of the public cloud, the seminal technology trend of our era. We are the first to market with next-generation energy-assisted drives, and we will continue to deliver new innovations to build upon our aerial density leadership.I joined Western Digital to be at the center of this incredible opportunity, innovating in one of the critical building blocks of the digital world, storage. Given the breadth and strength of our portfolio and the attractive markets we operate in, we need to best position the company for ongoing success.As a result, we have made the decision to suspend our dividend in order to reinvest in the business and support our deleveraging efforts. Bob will go into more details on our deleveraging objectives.Before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire Western Digital team, who have come together during this challenging time. It's been incredible to see the support, teamwork and leadership displayed across all levels. Together, I am confident we will get through this and emerge stronger than before.I will now ask Bob to share our financial highlights. So the first question, I missed part of it, but it sounded like that was on aligning a supply and demand of bit growth in the second half of the year. So look, I mean, let me start out with what we're seeing right now. I mean, we saw good demand. We saw, as Bob talked about, margins up this quarter.We're - next quarter was, as we expected and as we guided, margins up again. Obviously, as we get into the second half of the year, things get a little more difficult to really project. I think we're looking at various different recovery scenarios and how we will invest in those, and we'll be prudent about how we do that.On the nearline side, I mean, look, we're happy with where the product performed. The 14-terabyte is still performing well. 18-terabyte shipped for revenue this quarter, as we talked about. That we made that commitment, we delivered on that. The ramp is on schedule. We see great interest from that. There's no doubt we're in a little bit of a product transition in the industry, and that will play out over the next couple of quarters, but we're happy with where the portfolio is. Bob, do you have anything to add? You know, like anything, I think it's a combination of a lot of things. But certainly, the current situation, bring some focus to the desire to deleverage a little faster. But the real issue - and of course, the real issue is I come into the business, and the company is really well positioned. When I think - I talked about it in my remarks, when I think about the technology trends that are going on right now, I mean, it's happening in the cloud. Obviously, everybody knows that public cloud is a huge transition. We continue to see incredible growth, and we will. We can talk about that for a long time. We're very well positioned in that market. We perform in the fourth quarter. We'll see the hard drive market of the - the portfolio has been repositioned for that capacity - hard drive capacity enterprise market, and we'll see - actually see that market return to growth after several years of kind of decline and maybe going sideways a little bit.So we're very well indexed to what I think is one of the biggest technology trends we've seen in a very, very long time. And as that continues, that's going to be good for our portfolio. And then we have the flash portfolio, which if you look at the edge, we have just new markets coming online all the time, where we've talked about gaming, and we see VR headsets, all kinds of things are going to drive demand in that side of the market as well. So we're playing - the portfolio is very well positioned, and we have lots of opportunities to invest in the growth of the business. And when I think - when you put that all together, it was the right time to move on to a different model. Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Karl. Karl, I think one of the things you're going to see from me is I'm going to really focus on forecasting one quarter at a time. So it's not going to happen next quarter, but you knew that. I think we're looking several quarters out, I guess, is what I'll say at this point. I think - will it accelerate given the increased cloud demand we're seeing? We're seeing a lot of demand for that product already. I don't think it's going to accelerate one way or another based on if that demand - I mean, we're basically going to - we have the demand we need to ramp the product. So we're looking forward to it being a great launch now, and the team is very focused on continuing to make supply available, but we're excited about the product. Why don't you take the inventory question? Yes. I would say the same thing about the supply. Are we supply constrained? I think the balance is what we expected at this point, right? We continue to see strong demand there. Okay. So on the - thanks, Mehdi. On the first question, you're right, we are in a product transition, and we are excited about the 18-terabyte drive. I'm not yet an expert on hard drive areal density, but I've come up to speed on it relatively quickly. I mean, you're right, it's getting harder and harder to drive more density but we have an enormous amount of R&D in this area. And we're going to invest aggressively to make sure we maintain our lead in areal density.And I think you'll hear more from us coming up about that. There's lots of things going on as there always is and in R&D organizations, and that's been one of the things that has not been surprising to me when I came in, but it's great to see is just the depth of talent that's in the organization to drive the road map in that critical technology.And like I said - I mean, this is - when I look at the strategy of the company - I mean, we will have more to say about this in the future. But when I look at this coming in, I think the company is very well positioned in the fact that it made the pivot to flash. And the way I look at the world is how it evolves as you've got this.We're in like almost - it's kind of almost cliche\u0301 to say it about this unprecedented amount of technological change and always seems to be going faster. But I mean, really, over the last number of years, the change that the cloud and the public cloud is driven and the amount of technological change its pushing on every industry and every company is just astounding. There's lots of reasons for that. And many ways is democratizing the access to the most sophisticated technology, everybody can have it now through an API call. And that's just causing just a huge wave of investment and technological change and advancement for every company, every industry for all of us.Our portfolio is very well positioned to support. We provide one of the key building blocks or fundamental elements of that digital world, storage. And I think in the cloud and our leadership in areal density, we are very, very highly correlated to that growth vector in the industry. But not just that, it's also - on the flash side, you've got the edge and endpoints and what's happening there and they're becoming more sophisticated networks, which is something I'm pretty familiar with, giving my history.Networks are getting faster, that's enabling a lot more higher - much more capable end points to be interconnected, that's driving the flash side of the business. We talked about this in the prepared remarks. Just look at the gaming market, all of a sudden becomes - opens up to this - there's a new market that just opens up to us. And there will be more and more of those happening. And then these two things reinforce each other.The more innovation there is at the edge, on the endpoints, it drives more data, more data that needs to be stored, more data that needs to be processed, insights need to be derived from it. And that becomes kind of this virtuous cycle that happens. And I think the company is very well positioned on both sides of that.So we'll have more to say on how we zero in on that. You're right, it is a very dynamic market. It's very sensitive to supply and demand changes, but the general trajectory is a good one. We're in a good market. It's always great to be in great TAMs that are growing. As I said, even the hard drive business, which is - we've now - I say we, the team here has repositioned the portfolio around capacity enterprise, and you're seeing the growth now come back to that technology base, which is great to see.So look, I'll stop there. We'll have - I'll have more to say in the future. But as I said, I'm super happy to be here. I think it's - I think what this company provides is incredibly fundamental and critical for the world that we're all going to, and we use every day. So - and we'll dial that even more - dial that in more as we go forward. So thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. Thanks, C.J. So you got it right that we're going to stick to one quarter at a time. But I mean, they're going in the right direction. I mean, the fact - I mean, we - the forecast for next quarter is the forecast for next quarter. We feel good about where the demand is. As Bob said, I think I mentioned it before as well, we're looking at all different kinds of scenarios for the second half of the year. And as we get more information, we'll make decisions about our investment portfolio to support that.So it's not surprising. I think everybody sees the same thing right now. Visibility is a little bit difficult, but it's - we'll see how it goes week-by-week as we go through the quarter. Yes, Toshi, I mean, I think it's - I appreciate the question. I guess I'll say in general, it's a difficult quarter to draw lots of long-term conclusions about much of anything right now. The - I will say, the operations team has just done an incredible job. I mean, I've watched this play out now over the last seven weeks or so that I've been here.And we have a global footprint with factories and fabs all over the world, China, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, here in the U.S. And to see how all the best practices have been shared, and all of those have been kept open and functioning at some level and then increasing capabilities, working with our suppliers, I think that's a tremendous strength of the company.Again, I have more to say about that later. But again, I think this - the past seven weeks is not a time where you want to look at anything and draw a really long-term conclusion given the dynamic situation we're in.As far as financial metrics, there is lots of good ones. Clearly, gross margin is something we're going to be very focused on, making sure we're investing our resources in the places that can draw the highest return. That is obviously a very big focus and cash generation, quite honestly, and make sure we're managing for that. So those are two that are at the top of a whole long list. Yes. I think that it's been improving week over week. And as it stands right now, we're in good shape. Obviously, it's an incredibly dynamic situation. I'll say that right from the start. I mean, every day, it changes. And every day, of course, you get new information and make the best decision about how you're going to move forward, but the team has done a great job of that, kept things open the whole time.Literally, over the past two or three weeks, things have gotten significantly stronger, and it puts us in a position right now where I think we're - I don't want to use the term normal because I don't think anything is normal in the world right now, but we're operating at a level that - I mean, obviously, we're operating at a level that can support the forecast that we just put forward.So I feel really good about what the team has done and the position they've put us in around the world. And we're staying super vigilant to make sure, one, that we implement best practices across all of our facilities.We are working from home at a significant level everywhere we can, and that's making the situation better. But the people that have to come in to keep the businesses running. And as you know, we are an essential business. And everywhere we operate, that hasn't been an issue about getting any kind of authorization to operate, but making sure that the people that are in, the facilities are safe, and we've had good success there as well.Our supply chain, we've been working with our supply chain. We've been helping out our supply chain to make sure they get the appropriate government release to continue to operate. We've been doing some diversification of that to fill some gaps and some non-regrets moves on that. But right now, the supply chain, again, it's the same thing as our own facilities. It's - week by week, it's gotten better to a point where right now we feel like we're in a relatively strong position. First of all, hey, Mitch. How are you doing? Thanks for the question. I don't think we forecast smartphone units. I mean, again, the second half and what's going to happen. We're going to take it quarter-by-quarter at this point. We - obviously, we feel good about our guide for the next quarter and what we see on the supply and demand side to have a lot of confidence in that. And we'll have more to say about the second half next quarter. Thanks, Mitch. So I think as we talked about for the fourth quarter, we expect some headwinds in that business. I think it's typically a seasonally weak quarter anyway. And obviously, with stores not being open, it makes it a lot tougher. Last quarter, as we talked about towards the end of the quarter, we obviously saw a deterioration as stores were closed. And we also saw the mix shift to lower-margin products as well.We've got that all factored into the guide. I mean - again, we're very comfortable with the guide. The guide is a guide. And so we've got all the dynamics that we expect to happen in the retail channel baked into those numbers.Longer term, again, we'll have more to say about longer-term strategy. But I think it's a great strength of the company, those brands. I think it's an area where we can drive differentiation and we can drive margin in those channels as well. They're not just - it's not just all low-margin business.So I feel good about that capability. And honestly, it's one of the things that attracted me to the company. So we'll - again, we'll have more to say about what the long-term strategy is there, but I think it's definitely an asset. Thank you, Steve. Yes. Again, I always couch everything we're going to guide one quarter at a time, but it's a fair question. I mean, we - I guess the only thing we can say is we continue to see strong demand from the big cloud vendors, cloud suppliers. There's always a question, are they building inventory, are they buying ahead, the old consumption digestion kind of thing. Everything we see is there's strong demand for what their products are. I think they're saying the same thing. Not saying anything new there.How long it lasts? I mean, what I talked about in the intro of - in my prepared remarks, I mean, I think this world that we're all living in because of COVID-19, where there's just a lot more work at home, learn at home, there's just a lot more dependence on cloud and endpoint technology, I think that architecture has been set for some time now, and it's impacting every business. We've seen a massive acceleration to that, unfortunately, because of a global pandemic.The question is how much - is that going to continue to stay as it starts to subside? I don't - obviously, there'll be some variability in that given that there's so many people at home now. But like I said, I think the model is set, and I think it's how fast we're going to get there. I don't think there's a question on is it the right destination? So we'll see as we move into the second half.Our conversations with all those customers continue to be fantastic, you're right. One of the things that's been great as I've come into this company, is just to understand the depth of our relationship and the strength of our footprint and those customers is extremely impressive.And so we're going to stay very close to them and continue to work with them as they build out their infrastructure. But right now, I don't think - we don't have any sign that - well, I think what we're seeing is the increased demand and nothing tells us that it's nothing but real demand. And how far it extends into the second half, we'll see as we get more visibility. I don't really want to call out any one area over another because it -one, it changes quite a bit based on local situations. But obviously, if - there's a couple of different categories things fall in to. First is logistics. It's gotten more expensive to get to move stuff around. A lot of stuff went on domestic flight. So there's a lot or passenger flights. There's a lot fewer of those. So those costs are going up. Just the general number of places that are open and how difficult it is to move things around is a big category of cost.And then in places where we maybe do have a little bit of under - we can't run at full capacity, although that's getting to be less and less of an issue over the last couple of weeks there's some absorption costs that Bob talked about. And then there's some just general costs of just increased cleaning and those kinds of things. But those are relatively minor based on the other two. I don't know, Bob, anything else come to mind? Yes. It really has been a week over week. It's gotten much better. Oh, I don't know about for the next few quarters. But we have been somewhat successful in moving pricing to cover some of the increased costs. I think that's what our focus is on anything around pricing in the industry. But we're not looking at it. We're looking at it in the sense of what it takes to cover the increased costs that we have in the business. And we have a good idea what those are going to be for next quarter. And when we get there, we'll figure out what's going to happen in that. Bob, anything to add to that? Yes. I don't want to put a specific number on it because the potential - it's a very - as I said - said several times, a very dynamic environment. I would say that we have confidence in the supply - what the supply that's going to be produced to support the guide for the next quarter. We have a lot of confidence in that. But it could - things change every day. But I said the trend has been going - it's been getting better and better to where it's given us the confidence to put the guide in place that we have. We've had a chance to take a quick look at it. And we don't believe it will have a material impact on our business. But obviously, we're going to monitor it very, very closely. Yes. Again, we're going to stick to talking about things for next quarter. I don't have anything in particularly insightful to say about density trends and notebooks at this point. Bob, I don't know if you do. We can follow-up with you with some more details. Thank you, Weston. All right. Thank all of you for joining us here today. We look forward to seeing you virtually at the upcoming JPMorgan and Bank of America conferences. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and welcome to Western Digital. As Dave mentioned, the world has changed in the last few months. I'm impressed by how well the Western Digital team has come together and navigated through this challenging quarter. Results in the fiscal third quarter were generally in line with the guidance provided in January as demand held up well in most of our end markets. We had COVID-19-related impacts, which I will detail in a few minutes.Revenue was $4.2 billion, down 1% sequentially and up 14% from a year ago. By end market, Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 2% on a sequential basis and increased 13% year-over-year. Record client SSD revenue drove most of the sequential and year-over-year growth. As we look into the fiscal fourth quarter, we anticipate client SSD will experience another strong quarter of revenue growth.Notebook and PC-related hard drive revenue declined and now represents under 20% of our total HDD revenue. Smart video was a bit weaker than expected, primarily due to COVID-19.And finally, while mobile was up sequentially and year-over-year, we remain under-indexed to this part of the market. Data center devices and solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was up 2% sequentially and up nearly 22% year-over-year. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was flat on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew.Client Solutions revenue was $821 million, down 13% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Our retail business was impacted as we approached the end of the quarter due to COVID-19-related lockdown. These lockdowns will have an impact on our fiscal fourth quarter.Demand remains strong in our end markets as we look into the fiscal fourth quarter. Growth in client devices and data center devices and solutions should more than offset the decline in client solutions.By product category, flash revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 5% sequentially and bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. As we look into the fiscal fourth quarter demand for our flash-based solutions remains strong, and we anticipate that flash prices will rise on a sequential basis.Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 12% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $85, and exabyte shipments were down 6%.As we move on to cost and expenses, please note, all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise with COVID-19 impacts detailed where appropriate.Gross margin for the third quarter was up two percentage points sequentially to 27.9%. The start-up costs of our fab in Kitakami, K1, were $62 million and the COVID-19-related costs in the quarter were $13 million. For clarity, both items are included in the reported non-GAAP gross margin. The COVID-19 costs were primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics and other costs.Our flash gross margin was 26.5%, up seven percentage points from last quarter due to a stronger pricing environment and cost reductions. In the quarter, we began to ship production units out of K1.The hard drive gross margin declined to 29.3% from 30.8% in the prior quarter, mostly due to the COVID-19 impact and mix shifts.Operating expenses were $738 million, slightly lower than expected. Other income and expense was $91 million, higher than expected due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. The tax rate came in at 23.5% in the quarter, which was lower than our prior range of 25% to 27% for the full year.We now estimate our fiscal year 2020 tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. Earnings per share was $0.85. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $142 million, and free cash flow was $176 million. Our free cash flow was better than expected in a quarter that is usually seasonally low. So far, in fiscal 2020, we have generated $847 million in free cash flow and expect to generate very good cash flow in the fourth quarter.Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $34 million due to the timing of funds flowing back and forth to the joint venture. For the full fiscal year, we expect cash, capital expenditures to be an inflow of a couple hundred million dollars.Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion this fiscal year. We are assessing our fiscal 2021 capital expenditures based on the current economic environment.Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.8 billion. In the fiscal third quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders and made an optional $150 million debt paydown. Fiscal year-to-date, we've lowered our debt by about $920 million.Our first priority for cash utilization is to reinvest in the business. Since we are suspending our dividend, our second priority is repayment of debt. Our current plan is to reevaluate the dividend and other shareholder return policies, and our total debt is under $6 billion and our net debt is under $3 billion. Our goal through a cycle is to have a growth leverage in the range of one to 3.5 times EBITDA. Our current debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 5.0 times in the third quarter.I want to make it clear, suspending the dividend is not related to our debt covenants. We have substantial room under our covenants.Moving on to non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.45 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 29% and 31%. This range includes approximately $65 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. We're also anticipating the impact of COVID-19.Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the guidance range assumes normal variable compensation expense. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $75 million and $80 million. The tax rate should be between 24% and 25%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $1 and $1.40, assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares. We're using a wider range this quarter, primarily due to the uncertainty in the environment.With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator, we're ready for our first question. No, I think that's a good summary. I mean, we're ramping as planned. Yes. So the covenants are related to an adjusted EBITDA number that we use for compliance purposes. And so that the ratio is well below the five we show as a non-GAAP debt-to-EBITDA number. And we, as you saw, made progress in the quarter. Our gross leverage went from 5.7 to 5.0 this quarter. So we're definitely trending in the right direction. And as I said, we have plenty of room under the covenant. We just haven't given a lot of specifics on the actual compliance covenant. Yeah. Yes. We're still very bullish on the enterprise SSD market. And as you know, Joe, we've got goals to get up to 20% market share there. In the short term, you're right, it's a matter of balancing and making sure we've got the right controllers to go with the NAND for that market. And so that's probably the controller side is more of a challenge than the NAND side, but we're very, very optimistic on that business. Yes. I can start with the inventory question. So our inventories were up just slightly this quarter. I actually think in the next quarter, you'll see inventories coming down quite a bit because of some of the supply chain challenges. But I'd say everything seems to be an equilibrium in general. Yes. So Sidney, this is Bob. I'll take that. So the - actually, we probably have more absorption variance and cost headwinds in the fourth fiscal quarter than we had in the third. And we are trying to move prices up where we can in the market as a result of those incremental costs. So it's absorption, it's logistics costs, it's other costs and making sure the environments are safe around the world. So it's actually a bigger challenge in the fourth quarter. Yeah. So without talking too much about the specific number, as you know, this was always anticipated to be a low growth CapEx year for us. Because if you go back a year ago, we were reducing the amount of capacity we had. We actually took some off-line about a year ago, as you'll recall. And then along with our partner, we had pushed out some of the CapEx expectations. So we'd always expected this to be a light year. And I still expect CapEx will be up next year. I'm not ready at this point to say how much that will be. Yes. This is Bob. I'll take a cut at this, C.J. I believe I said the K1 costs were at $62 million in the current quarter and guided to around $65 million next quarter. I think that will be roughly the level through the rest of the calendar year, and then you should start to see it drop off pretty quickly next year as volume starts to ramp more. So I think that's kind of the way we're seeing it right now.In terms of COVID-19, we aren't going to get specific in terms of the cost. As I mentioned, we'll have more absorption variances this quarter. We'll also have more logistics costs this quarter and a number of other costs. We're going to be able to partially offset that with pricing. And our customers will share in some of that, but we're still net-net, going to have some headwind there for COVID-19. But I don't want to get too detailed on that because it's just too hard to tell how it will actually play out. Yes. So C.J., as you know, we're just guiding one quarter out right now. As you can imagine, probably like every company, we have multiple scenarios that we're evaluating. As I said, we think inventory is roughly in equilibrium right now. And we'll just have to take it one quarter at a time as we move forward. So far, demand has held out pretty well for us, and we'll just have to see how that continues through the year. But I don't see major changes right now. Yes. I mean, where all vendors producing at this point, and that could change when everybody's producing it. All right. Mitch, it's Bob. I'll start. One of the things we've done is we've studied the capital structure quite a bit. And what we've concluded is, obviously, it's a cyclical business. We want to have a growth leverage that works for us through the cycle. We're expecting, as we bring our debt levels down, that we'll manage to anywhere from one to 3.5 times EBITDA depending on where we are in the cycle. And as I mentioned, the goal is to get our gross debt down to about $6 billion and our net debt to $3 billion. And yes, I don't know if you want to take. Yes. The thing I would add, as you recall, Mitch, I mean, we're under-indexed to the mobile phone market. So we're not trying to forecast it, and we're not as exposed to it as some of our customers - I'm sorry, some of our competitors. Yes. So two good questions. OpEx, I think the best assumption is it will be around the levels we guided to this quarter for the next few quarters anyway.On the tax rate, the dilemma is we have a fantastic structure when we're making more money than we are right now. And so right now, when our profitability levels are relatively low, we have certain minimum taxes we have to pay around the world and it makes our tax rate quite high. So it will come down as the overall profitability starts to come up. Yes. I'd say the share was fairly flat. That market is growing quite a bit. So we're - as I mentioned earlier, we're a bit constrained on controllers right now, but the demand is definitely there. No, I think that's right. I mean, I think certainly, May will be better than April, and I think June will be even a little better than May. No, I agree. Yes. No, I don't. I mean, obviously, it's come up over the last year, but I think as we go forward, we don't really know. Yes. Thanks, everyone."

[Operator Instructions]  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Steve Milligan, Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations, business plans, trends in financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Milligan: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon. Western Digital delivered solid results in the second quarter as revenue came in at the midpoint of the guidance range and non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. Our performance reflects strong execution in our product roadmap, success in increasing our hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash environment. Notably, these results reinforce our prior comments that the June quarter marked the bottom of this flash cycle. We extended our capacity enterprise product leadership as we started sampling 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives in December. These drives feature our energy-assisted magnetic recording technology providing unrivaled areal density and TCO benefits. We expect to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the March quarter and ramp shipments through the rest of calendar 2020. Our 14-terabyte platform is performing well, and customer interest in our air based 10-terabyte drive is quite high. The strength of our capacity enterprise product portfolio will continue to allow us to maintain our leading market share position. We achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share and secured additional NVMe design wins, including at another major hyperscale customer positioning us for continued revenue growth and share gains. We made it an important announcement this afternoon of our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5, with 112 layers of vertical storage. BiCS5 joins a full portfolio of 3D NAND technologies as our highest density and most advanced 3D NAND to date, delivering exceptional performance and reliability. Our team executed well in the quarter, increasing our hard drive non-GAAP gross margins to approximately 31% from 28.5% in the prior quarter. We now expect an accelerated recovery in our flash gross margins in the first half of calendar 2020 with continued improvement through the end of the year. I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.\nMike Cordano: Thank you and good afternoon. Our December results reflect solid product execution, an increase in hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash market environment.  Data Center Devices and Solutions, we executed well in delivering new products, positioning us for continued share gains and profitable growth in calendar year 2020. In capacity enterprise drives, close collaboration between our head, media, and mechanical design teams allowed us to simultaneously introduce energy-assisted magnetic recording technology and a triple-stage actuator in our new 16, 18, and 20 terabyte drives. These innovations provide us with continued areal density leadership and a greater design margin resulting in best-in-class product quality and reliability. Our focus on introducing the right technology at the right time, while delivering the best TCO and highest product quality to hyperscale and OEM customers makes us their trusted partner. In calendar year 2019, the success of our capacity enterprise product line led by our 14-terabyte drive drove over 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We also started sampling our 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives and plan to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the current quarter. As these drives ramp along with our 10-terabyte air-based drives, we are well positioned for continued leadership. In flash, we achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share as our NVMe based enterprise SSD revenue grew over 50% sequentially. Supply constraints limited our upside as demand was better than expected. I am encouraged to see the significant investments we have made in expanding our product portfolio over the past several years are enabling us to increase participation in higher margin, higher growth, and lower volatility parts of the flash market. We have secured additional design wins, including another major hyperscale customer, which demonstrates our success in broadening our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base. In calendar year 2020, we expect to double our enterprise SSD revenue as we move towards our goal of 20% market share. Our competitive position within the data center is unrivaled, built on the breadth of our product portfolio, strong customer relationships, technology leadership, and superior product quality. We look forward to another year of strong growth in the data center market. Client Devices, strong growth in client SSD, and smart video along with growth in mobility and desktop hard drives drove the sequential revenue growth in the December quarter. As we enter the March quarter, flash pricing continues to improve. Furthermore, starting in the June quarter, we expect to begin shipments into a new gaming platform. The gaming console market is expected to be a multi-exabyte opportunity this calendar year. Within Client Solutions, strong holiday demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions enabled revenue to grow on a sequential basis. At CES 2020, we demonstrated a range of innovative products including the world's highest capacity, pocket-sized, portable SSD and the world's first USB 3.2 SSD exclusively for gaming. This afternoon, we announced our fifth generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5. Utilizing a wide range of new technology and manufacturing innovation, BiCS5 has significantly increased cell array density horizontally across the wafer. These lateral scaling advancements in combination with 112 layers of vertical memory capability enables BiCS5 to offer up to 40% more bits of storage capacity per wafer compared to Western Digital's 96-layer BiCS4 technology. We have commenced shipping initial consumer products built on BiCS5 with mass production expected to begin later this calendar year. We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels, and with strong demand for our products we are experiencing pockets of tightness. These dynamics combined with continued product execution in both flash and hard drives position us well for continued profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.\nBob Eulau: Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a year ago. Please recall that the September quarter was a 14-week quarter. By end markets, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was down 3% sequentially and up nearly 40% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, growth in enterprise SSD was offset by a decline in capacity enterprise drives and the impact of our exit from the storage-system business. Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 11% on a sequential basis and decreased nearly 20% year-over-year. As Mike noted earlier, the sequential growth was driven by client SSD, smart video, mobility, and desktop HDD. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to pricing in flash, our decision to limit our participation in mobility, and a decreased TAM for notebook and desktop hard drives. Client Solutions revenue was $948 million, up 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by strength in hard drives. By product category, flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 8% sequentially, primarily related to our increased participation in mobility. Bit shipments were up 24% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, roughly flat sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Average price per hard drive was flat sequentially at $81. And exabyte shipments were down 1% sequentially. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the December quarter was up 1.1 percentage point sequentially to 25.9%. Our flash gross margin was 19.5%, up slightly from last quarter, as a better pricing environment was offset by our increased participation in mobile. The hard drive gross margin grew more than expected to almost 31% from 28.5% the prior quarter. This improvement was due to the full realization of the cost benefits of the KL closure and a stable pricing environment as overall ASP per drive sequentially flat at $81. Operating expenses were $765 million. Operating expenses with normal incentive compensation expense would have been closer to $720 million. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $257 million and free cash flow was $377 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were an inflow of $120 million. As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds going back and forth between us and the joint venture. For the full fiscal year, we expect cash capital expenditures to be close to zero. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. An effort to provide greater transparency and clarity into our capital expenditures, we've added a few new slides to our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website. In the December quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders. We reduced debt by $388 million, which included an optional $325 million debt pay-down. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority is to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After that, paying our dividend and reducing our debt are the next priorities. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our $2.25 billion revolver remained unused and our gross debt outstanding was just under $10 billion. Total inventory dollars were down $165 million on a sequential basis as both hard drive and flash inventory decrease. Moving on, our non-GAAP guidance for the third fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 28.5% to 29.5%. Please note that this range includes approximately $70 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the guidance range assumes a return to normal variable compensation expense, in selective new R&D investment. We expect interest and other expense of $80 million to $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be around to be between 25% and 27%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.85 and $1.05, assuming approximately $305 million in fully diluted shares. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you and congrats on the strong guidance. When you speak of an accelerated recovery here in flash gross margins, can you layout the key drivers of that through 2020 and how you're thinking about the velocity of that recovery and any thoughts on where you might exit the calendar year?\nSteve Milligan: Yes, Wamsi, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So, there's really a couple of different things that I would say are going on in terms of the flash market. One, the first thing is as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we believe that inventory levels in \u2013 from an industry perspective to the best of our estimation have returned in the balance or call it normal levels. So, that's one thing that occurred. The other thing is, is obviously we have been working very hard on improving our product lineup, which is allowing us to sell into markets that carry higher gross margin profiles as well as their stickier business, and we believe that that will help us over time to manage the volatility that is associated with the flash business. The other thing is that, as part of all that is, is that there is an increasing awareness on behalf of our customer base that that inventory supply and demand is tightening up. In other words, demand is going to exceed supply this year. And so, we're seeing customers recognizing that. Prices are improving. Right now, that tightness is, it's kind of in pockets. It's not necessarily across the board. So we're seeing pockets of tightness in the market, and as we move through the balance of the year, we expect that that tightness will increase. And so what that means from a gross margin perspective, last quarter we said that we thought we would see modest improvement in our gross margins in the flash area. Now, we're saying that our margin profile will \u2013 it will accelerate in terms of that improvement, and I would expect as we move into the back half of the year, we'll see an increasing \u2013 more of that as the market tightens up even more in the back half of calendar 2020. What that means from a numeric perspective is that we would say that we have the opportunity for our flash gross margins to get into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the calendar year.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, great. That's great, Steve. Thanks. Appreciate the color. And can you maybe just and you guys obviously executed pretty well in the quarter on the HDD side as you had guided to sort of have those margins step up as well. Can you talk about the path of the HDD gross margins from here as well? Thank you.\nBob Eulau: Yes, I think the way to think about those is we're in a range where we're comfortable going forward. So we will continue to operate around the range that we reported.\nSteve Milligan: With a bias -- Wamsi, I would add to that. With a bias for those margins improving over time as an increasing amount of our hard drive volume shifts to capacity enterprise. So what we've talked about is something in the mid-30% range. We're not necessarily saying that that will happen in this calendar year, but that should be the bias over a period of time.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. First kind of keeping on the hard disk drive business, I know you talked about it in the press release or the slide deck, a 100% plus growth year-over-year in nearline HDD capacity shipments. But given the competitive landscape and the questions, I'm curious, what did that \u2013 how did that perform on a sequential basis and how are you currently seeing the competitive environment?\nSteve Milligan: Yes, so I think in general, we maintain our leading market share position, call it in the kind of low to mid-50s. We'll see where this all settles out once everybody reports. We expect that to continue right through the first half of this calendar year. And then in the back half, we obviously think we have some opportunity to continue to grow slightly. So from a product positioning standpoint, we feel very good about not only our 2014, which continues to be the highest volume shipper, but the expected ramp of our 16, 18, and 20 which will occur throughout the year. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we will begin initial revenue shipments in the current quarter.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then on the gross margin on the flash side, mix can be a meaningful driver to gross margin. But I'm curious as you continue to execute on BiCS, I guess, it'd be BiCS4 and now we start to talk about BiCS5. Can you just update us on how we think about the cost curve relative to that mix shift effect to kind of take you back to that as you said, 35% to 40% gross margin? And just where are we at currently in the mix of BiCS4 in terms of bits shipped right now?\nMike Cordano: Yes, BiCS4 is the overwhelming majority of bits. We\u2019re just starting the initial BiCS5 ramp. The way to think about Aaron, though, is really in this kind of 15% plus or minus annualized cost take down, and certainly we would expect that to continue as we move through this next product transition. Relative to mix, I would say both product and market segment exposure and then of course the broader ASP pricing environment are going to be the drivers of the margin enhancement through the calendar year 2020.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two follow-ups for Mike and Steve. First on the NAND side and on the game console rather new game console, and this is incremental as I imagine the prior generations are hard disk drive base and now is moving to SSDs. And there are some figures out there. I\u2019m just wanted to see, what is your assumption for the kind of NAND supply that the new game console is going to consume, given the fact that this is incremental. And I have a follow-up.\nMike Cordano: Yes, I think you\u2019re right. It is all incremental. And from an industry standpoint and certainly from our standpoint, because we were not participating in the gaming market in 2019 calendar year, on the hard drive side. I don\u2019t think we want to go any farther than what we said in our prepared remarks, this is going to be a large multi-exabyte market and we wouldn\u2019t want to comment any more specifically.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, fair. Moving on to hard disk drive, obviously, you\u2019re introducing a new 18 terabyte. Can you help me understand how you\u2019re cost competitive? I understand, your product has a fewer number of plates and as we migrate from 16 to 18. How that cost competitiveness is going to be used to increase market share.\nMike Cordano: Yes. So I think from our standpoint, we think we have a significant time to market lead on 18 and 20. And so the platter count to our understanding is, distance with next generation. So our benefit relative to market share is always about bringing the right products in the market in a leading way, getting smoothly through customer qualification and ramping quickly. We\u2019ve been doing that generation over generation for several years. We will do that again on the 18, 16 and 20-terabyte product that we\u2019ll be ramping this year.\nSteve Milligan: And we \u2013 and Mehdi, we do have a cost advantage and we would think that, I mean, that\u2019s represented in our underlying hard drive gross profit performance. And one of the things that you\u2019re alluding to is that, our capacity enterprise drive and this continues for the 16, 18 and 20-terabyte drives that we are using aluminum media versus glass media and that is a lower cost?\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two, if I may. First question is regarding your NAND supply outlook and you were calling for 30% growth for the industry in calendar 2020. Is most of that coming from process conversions and what sitting an inventory? Or is it going to be dictated by adding substantial Greenfield capacity at the K1 facility? And in addition to that, your South Korean peer last night spoke about NAND demand \u2013 industry NAND demand growing kind of high-20s for 2020. How does that play into your capital planning process?\nSteve Milligan: Yes. Hey, Karl, one thing I want to comment is, when they were talking about high 20%, I believe that was supply growth, not demand growth. So, but anyway, I\u2019ll let Mike comment on the specifics.\nMike Cordano: Yes. So all the growth, both ours and the industry is technology transition. So our K1 expansion is all about technology \u2013 room for technology transition. There is no way for capacity in our plans going in. And that\u2019s really it, I think that \u2013 across the industry. And just to comment further on where we think, we talked about low 30s in terms of supply growth, Steve commented on what Samsung\u2019s comments were. We believe demand growth will be in the 35% plus range this year.\nSteve Milligan: Hence, the shortage.\nKarl Ackerman: Very helpful. Last one, if I may. Your enterprise SSD market share opportunity is quite significant and I think impressive. But when we think about that \u2013 how much of that is driven by a new server architecture launch this year versus retrofitting existing servers? And I asked because a Tier 1 U.S. based hyperscale are just announced after the close that depreciation will be lower for them in March due to an increase in useful life of their server. So if I could just kind of talk about that a little bit, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nMike Cordano: Yes. So no, we\u2019re not dependent on any specific server transition. So what we\u2019re able to do with our NVMe products is when both new server and existing socket design wins in the NVMe space. And then of course, similarly in SaaS, there\u2019ll be a series of new products announced, where we will be designed. And so we\u2019re not dependent on any particular server transition and it\u2019s really the power of and strength for the product portfolio as well as the customer\u2019s view of us as a preferred supplier that\u2019s driving that share growth.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nMike Cordano: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just going back \u2013 two for me as well. On the HDD side, can you just talk a little bit about as 16, 18 and 20 ramp through the year just for your nearline business? What do you think the gross margin in ASP impacts will be there? And then on the NAND side, there was early comment, you talked a little bit about mix. Could you just give us a sense as to the dilution from mobile? And should we expect more or less participation in that market as we move through calendar 2020. Thank you.\nBob Eulau: Yes. Tim, this is Bob. So the first one on the hard drive, and we have not been giving specifics on capacity enterprise margins, but they are better than average. And as we\u2019ve said before, as our mix trends towards more and more across the enterprise, we do expect our hard drive gross margins can get up into the mid-30% range. So that\u2019ll be a benefit to us. And from \u2013 on the mix question, I mean, we\u2019re not \u2013 also not able to get specific, in terms of exactly what the numerical implication was that mobile, but it obviously was a dilutive to us this quarter. And over time, we\u2019ll always participate some in the mobile market, but we\u2019ll continue to manage that.\nSteve Milligan: Yes. And I add the flash supply demand situation tightens up, we will see the mobile market become more attractive for us from a gross margin perspective.\nTim Long: Okay. Good point. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the planning process behind the CapEx at the JV level on NAND. To the extent that you guys are feeling better about the business and where profitability is going. Do you feel the need to change CapEx at the JV? And then I guess, sort of second half of that question, you said earlier that \u2013 earlier in the year that you can sort of get the industry big growth without a lot of CapEx, because you won\u2019t have the fab shut down, you won\u2019t have the power outage. Can you just update us on your thinking of how that impacts your supply growth for the calendar year?\nSteve Milligan: Yes. I\u2019ll comment overall on the CapEx in terms of that growth and that sort of thing. I mean, from an overall philosophical perspective, I mean, we want to be adding a bid supply to the market that is consistent largely with the overall growth from a demand perspective. So we\u2019re not \u2013 as a result of an improving environment, we\u2019re not looking at accelerating or decelerating our plans. But over a longer period of time, we would want to try to manage our growth from a supply perspective to growth and demand. And so that hasn\u2019t changed.\nJoe Moore: Great., thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves: Hey, guys. Just two questions from me. I just want to try to clarify at least get some numbers around this or any way to think about it. So when you look at the SSD opportunities, you\u2019re just trying to double your share there for the NVMe, it\u2019s under the statement you guys made in the slide deck. And you combine that with the gaming platforms coming in. How much of that is adding to kind of the overall demands, you guys gave a 35% number. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of this you guys have clean visibility on so we can get an understanding of how much that demand is gaming plus your share gains on the enterprise side.\nMike Cordano: So the broader sort of industry demand number we gave you as independent of our own share growth, right. So \u2013 and in any one of these particular segments. So our view of 35% demand side growth on the year is an aggregate across the industry per bit. While we talk about segment share gains in enterprise SSD and in gaming that's obviously product segment related gains. So we're not going to talk specifically about that. I think you can kind of calculate where we think we're going on the enterprise SSD side given my comment.\nSteve Milligan: Yes, add kind of further context to that. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to place our bits in those markets that characterize. I will call it one or two elements. One, opportunities for us to add more value from a product perspective, thereby driving higher gross margin, referring to that is, let's call it enterprise market. And then also those areas of the market that are either stickier, less volatile so that we can manage the ups and downs that tend to occur in this kind of market. Gaming, yes, it's incremental from a flash perspective, but it also tends to be stickier business, more predictable. And so it has some of those characteristics that are attractive to us as we look to place our business in more attractive parts of the market. As opposed to, let's call it more transactional or price-driven areas of the market.\nMitch Steves: Got it. Understood. And then just last one, you guys have mentioned like 40% kind of NAND gross margin is kind of the goal you guys want to get to, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how that ramps, is that something you guys think you can exit at in calendar year or is it going to take a lot longer than that? Just looking for any sort of help, when you guys think you can get to the kind of 40% number you've talked to in the past?\nSteve Milligan: Well, what I commented on is that given the trajectory of our business and where we see it playing out in calendar year, we expect that our flash gross margin rate will move into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the year. Now that's not being specific as that calendar Q3 or calendar Q4 wants to see exactly how the market evolves. But we clearly continue to believe that 40% range is the right level for us and we believe that we'll begin to approach that, I mean in the back half of the calendar year.\nMitch Steves: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about industry bit supply growth in the low-30s and you would be in line with that. Can you share with us what you expect to revenue on a bit basis? And as part of your thinking there, how are you contemplating bits for mobility versus elsewhere?\nBob Eulau: Well, the one thing I'd say relative, we don't comment specifically, but we would expect to have our own inventory positions in quite balanced state. We are entering the year and we expect it to be exiting the calendar year. So to the extent you want to calculate that, that will give you a feel for it.\nC.J. Muse: Okay. And you're thinking on the mobility side, is that something that, you\u2019re thinking maybe on the \u2013 you'll stick more to enterprise and consoles?\nBob Eulau: No. The mobility side is not all equal. And part of our effort over the last several years is getting more product diversification, as Steve talked about some of the newer areas. But we will continue to maintain exposure to mobility. We will just manage that exposure and make sure we're making or we're able to make good choices as the market continues to evolve. So we see it as a long-term area of investment.  We'd see there are some very attractive parts within the mobile marketplace. So we'll continue to be investing there. We'll just be able to manage our bid allocation more broadly through this calendar year and into the future.\nC.J. Muse: Excellent. And as my follow-up, another question on the NAND gross margins, shocking. But if you could I guess speak to the K1 charges, when you think they might roll-off and how accretive that might be? And also given kind of the state of the industry today, are you running 100% utilization and what kind of tailwind do you see there? Thank you.\nMike Cordano: Yes. So in terms of K1, I mean, we're now having real production runs and we'll continue to have more production as we progress through the year, that this last quarter we didn't have quite as larger charges we thought we were going to, I think it came in around 65 million and I think we had said on this call last quarter would be around 75 million. In the current quarter, in the March quarter, we're expecting around 70 million in terms of a period expense charge. And that should start to go down after this quarter. And it's really a function of how we ramp production and obviously ability to absorb those costs, but it'll start to get better I think from here.\nBob Eulau: Yes. And one thing just to comment on when I talked about 35% to 40% flash gross margins in the back half of the calendar year, that is inclusive of any potential startup costs that would still remain in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS. \nMunjal Shah: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, two questions. One, could you just update us on the CEO search and then secondly on HDD exabyte, they were down 1% sequentially, but then you talk about 100% growth on exabyte basis on year-on-year, so if you could pie those two as to why on a sequential basis exabyte would be down? And related to near line, what's the visibility into 2020?\nSteve Milligan: Yes. So I'll take the CEO search comment or a question, and then Mike can comment on capacity enterprise. So regarding the search, the search process is ongoing. And one of the things that I will add to that is the board is very pleased with the progress that they're making today. And so that's all the update we have for now.\nMike Cordano: And relative to the capacity enterprise marketplace, our fiscal quarter one was a record a shipment for us. Our exabyte share was around 57%. We were operating to optimize both profit and maintain our kind of leading share position in this space, so some of that would be as little bit of a share drop. And I talked about that 53% to 55% depending on where things settle out. But as we looked into the first half of this calendar year, we see demand across the breadth of the market remaining fairly strong. And we think we're in a good position to maintain this leading market share position that I just talked about. So visibility is good. Obviously different customers have different plans, but when we aggregate it, we feel pretty comfortable with continued strength and demand through the first half of the calendar year.\nMunjal Shah: Yes, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions from me, first of all, you mentioned that you became supply constraint on the NVMe SSDs during the quarter. Can you just sort of talk about how you work that through and what it implies for future growth, maybe this quarter, next quarter? And then secondly, I was wondering if you could expand on your comment about the pockets of tightness you're currently seeing, what exactly would you call out, I guess besides the enterprise, but anything you can elaborate on there and where maybe it those pockets expand to in the coming quarter? Thank you.\nMike Cordano: Yes. So I'll take the question on the NVMe supply constraint. It was not a flash supply constraint issue, basically what happened is the demand was better than we had expected and it was some of the components that we use in our NVMe SSD product. We've worked to resolve those and it should not be an issue as we move forward through calendar 2020. And then the other question?\nSteve Milligan: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is, in general demand has been very strong across fine SSD, really in the performance categories. So in some parts of the world there are some constraints there and that's being shown \u2013 that\u2019s being reflected in the movement on pricing in a positive direction.\nSteven Fox: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the sharp growth in the enterprise, in the NVMe SSD platforms, given the strong momentum on these products and the strong cloud spending environment. Do you think that you guys actually exited the calendar year tracking at low-double digits percentage market share or are we still somewhat constrained on the supply exiting the year?\nMike Cordano: Yes. To Steve's comment, we actually saw a demand in excess of our availability of the actual other components. So had we been able to fully realize that? Frankly we had been in the low-double digits on share. That remedies itself as we're now inside lead time. We continue to see strong demand for those products. And as I talked about, we expect to double revenue in that category year-over-year.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thanks. And on the HDD side, on the outlook for capacity enterprise exabyte shipments up kind of 35% year-over-year this year, it seems a bit conservative. I mean we're hearing that it's more likely in the mid-40% range or with 60% type year-over-year growth in the first half of this year, just given the continued strong cloud spending trends. So wondering if you can kind of layout your assumptions maybe here in the first half of the year for exabyte consumption just given that cloud and hyperscale spending still seems to be quite strong.\nMike Cordano: Yes, we haven\u2019t been too specific on that. I will say, I will give you a comment that we do see at this time a bias up in demand. So I think that\u2019s reflected in your comments. So, relative to a 35% or so annual expectation, I think our current view is a bias up from there.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, thanks guys for taking the question. Congratulations on a solid performance and it\u2019s good to see the guide you\u2019re really amplifying here. I\u2019ll just stick with nearline Steve; could you just give us a little more context about how you see the aesthetic? And then Mike as well of the cloud cycle through the year, Mike it sounds like you\u2019re saying you expected through the balance of calendar year 2020 now to some extent. Steve or Mike, do you see it potentially continuing? Is this a potential, I\u2019m not asking for a guide, but the potential to continue exabyte demand going up sort of into the back half of the year, is this sort of one where it gets up to a peak sooner, but then maybe is sort of an extended kind of cycle. Any context there would be great. Appreciate it.\nMike Cordano: Let me try to clarify a little bit. We certainly see the first half of the calendar year remaining strong. I\u2019ll reference back to the comments I just made. On an annualized basis, we\u2019ve been talking about 35% annualized growth. We do see on an annualized basis a bias up from there. I wouldn\u2019t want to comment kind of any further on, the way the full year or the shape of each of the individual quarters look.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that clarification. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Just to follow up on the previous questions, Steve. I guess, we\u2019ve had pretty strong two quarters from the cloud end market here and there\u2019s some concern that there may be a digestion period as you ahead into the first half. And I think Intel did say that, they expect somewhat of a digestion period. I\u2019m just wondering, you tend to have pretty long visibility, especially on the drive side. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any signs of slowdown out there that causes these to kind of, believe that there\u2019s going to be a digestion period.\nSteve Milligan: Yes. So again, all customers not created equal. There are some that are doing that, but when we aggregate it, the demand remains quite strong through the first half of the calendar year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.\nVijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, guys. I\u2019m just wondering, I saw your CapEx is down for fiscal 2020, keeping the discipline. I just wondering, I should look at the rest of the ecosystem. Are you seeing any aggressive CapEx, or how do you view that? And also on the China side with YMTC as it continue to expand, what are your thoughts in terms of supply coming in with increased or aggressive CapEx given how NAND pricing has been trending? Thanks.\nSteve Milligan: Yes. I will comment in terms of overall industry, the extent that there\u2019s public information. But as Samsung indicated and others have indicated, we\u2019re all circling at a bit supply growth rate that\u2019s kind of in a similar neighborhood. With Samsung talking about high 20% \u2013 20% growth rate and we\u2019re talking low or mid \u2013 in low 30s. And so, we\u2019re kind of all aggregating and we\u2019re not seeing anybody adding capacity from a NAND supply perspective that would concern us, certainly not on the short term because it would take up to 18 months for that to become productive capacity. And so, we\u2019re not seeing anybody behave in a way that we think that would upset the balance from a supply demand perspective. So we feel pretty good about that. YMTC, no real change in terms of our expectations there. We do not see them having any material impact in terms of the market for the next several years. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that depending upon their ability to ramp, not only from a pure production standpoint, but from a technology perspective. But certainly no concerns I would say over the next two to three years in that regard. And that\u2019s kind of within the planning cycle that we would have visibility to.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Great, thank you. The question is if you can look at your calendar Q1 guide being roughly flat quarter-by-quarter, which seems to be better than seasonal, especially on the NAND side. Can you talk about your expectations made by products hard-drive versus SLC drives or by segment? I\u2019m just curious how much of that above seasonal goal is a function of ASP improvement for NAND?\nSteve Milligan: So let me, I\u2019ll comment at a really high level and then Mike or Bob can add a little bit more specifics. But I mean, if you look at first thing, I\u2019m going to answer it and kind of a backdoor sort of way. If you look at our gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, which is pretty significant in terms of 25.9 to 28.5 to 29.5 in terms of the range, almost all of that is driven by improving flash environment. So namely pricing, all right. And so, and yes, there\u2019s mix improvements and that sort of thing. And so that directly impacts revenue. So when you look at an improving pricing environment that\u2019s helping us to keep our revenues, let\u2019s call it flattish on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And then beyond that, we continue to see the overall demand environment to be solid. I mean, just kind of solid, not great, not necessarily, but not bad. And so it\u2019s just kind of there and that\u2019s both a flash and a hard drive statement. And so that\u2019s allowing us to kind of work against what would be normal seasonality drop in revenue in calendar Q1. So are really kind of the two big factors.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thank you. And great to see the accelerated NAND flash recovery in the gross margins. I did want to make sure I understand the dynamic that is going on there. Do you expect your own NAND flash inventory to decline Q-on-Q for the March quarter which I think as Micron has commented; they were expecting their NAND flash inventory to accumulate. But for NAND flash prices to increase. So I\u2019m just wondering if you had some color there as far as your expectations on that.\nBob Eulau: Yes, this is Bob. I can make a couple of comments and I don\u2019t want to start giving guidance for inventory by quarter. But we\u2019re still not satisfied with where we are on inventory in spite of the reduction that we saw this quarter. And our goal over the next few quarters is to get to at least five turns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on internally as a company. So it\u2019ll \u2013 it won\u2019t be strictly linear getting there, but we think we can achieve that fairly soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to some of the questions about your 18, 20 gigabit drive and terabyte drives that have been released. Can you discuss how the gross margin acceleration or the TAC-2, your target gross margin is impacted by your ability to get those out sooner in terms of the development of those drives? You talked about I think the last quarter the nine-platter was pulled in somewhat in terms of development. How does that help in the acceleration of the gross margin progression?\nBob Eulau: Yes, this is Bob. I guess the first thing I would say is our gross margins are already very good in terms of capacity enterprise. And as I said earlier, is our mix tends more and more toward capacity enterprise that\u2019ll pull up our overall hard drive mix. Our mix was not as good as prior quarters, this past quarter, but you still saw the margin improvement. You saw that ASP stayed flat in spite of a tougher mix. So overall I think margins are very solid on capacity enterprise and I think as we introduced a new product, that trend will continue.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark, before we end with a short statement by our CEO.\nMark Miller: Thank you. But I believe the questions I wanted to address about the second half strength in data center and also nearline have been posed. So, I don\u2019t need to posed those again.\nSteve Milligan: Hey Mark, good to hear your voice.\nSteve Milligan: All right. So thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco. Have a good rest of the day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Eulau",
            "content": "Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a year ago. Please recall that the September quarter was a 14-week quarter. By end markets, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was down 3% sequentially and up nearly 40% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, growth in enterprise SSD was offset by a decline in capacity enterprise drives and the impact of our exit from the storage-system business. Client Devices revenue of $1.8 billion was up 11% on a sequential basis and decreased nearly 20% year-over-year. As Mike noted earlier, the sequential growth was driven by client SSD, smart video, mobility, and desktop HDD. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to pricing in flash, our decision to limit our participation in mobility, and a decreased TAM for notebook and desktop hard drives. Client Solutions revenue was $948 million, up 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by strength in hard drives. By product category, flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 8% sequentially, primarily related to our increased participation in mobility. Bit shipments were up 24% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, roughly flat sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Average price per hard drive was flat sequentially at $81. And exabyte shipments were down 1% sequentially. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the December quarter was up 1.1 percentage point sequentially to 25.9%. Our flash gross margin was 19.5%, up slightly from last quarter, as a better pricing environment was offset by our increased participation in mobile. The hard drive gross margin grew more than expected to almost 31% from 28.5% the prior quarter. This improvement was due to the full realization of the cost benefits of the KL closure and a stable pricing environment as overall ASP per drive sequentially flat at $81. Operating expenses were $765 million. Operating expenses with normal incentive compensation expense would have been closer to $720 million. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $257 million and free cash flow was $377 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were an inflow of $120 million. As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds going back and forth between us and the joint venture. For the full fiscal year, we expect cash capital expenditures to be close to zero. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. An effort to provide greater transparency and clarity into our capital expenditures, we've added a few new slides to our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website. In the December quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders. We reduced debt by $388 million, which included an optional $325 million debt pay-down. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority is to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After that, paying our dividend and reducing our debt are the next priorities. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our $2.25 billion revolver remained unused and our gross debt outstanding was just under $10 billion. Total inventory dollars were down $165 million on a sequential basis as both hard drive and flash inventory decrease. Moving on, our non-GAAP guidance for the third fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 28.5% to 29.5%. Please note that this range includes approximately $70 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the guidance range assumes a return to normal variable compensation expense, in selective new R&D investment. We expect interest and other expense of $80 million to $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be around to be between 25% and 27%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.85 and $1.05, assuming approximately $305 million in fully diluted shares. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question. Yes, I think the way to think about those is we're in a range where we're comfortable going forward. So we will continue to operate around the range that we reported. Yes. Tim, this is Bob. So the first one on the hard drive, and we have not been giving specifics on capacity enterprise margins, but they are better than average. And as we've said before, as our mix trends towards more and more across the enterprise, we do expect our hard drive gross margins can get up into the mid-30% range. So that'll be a benefit to us. And from \u2013 on the mix question, I mean, we're not \u2013 also not able to get specific, in terms of exactly what the numerical implication was that mobile, but it obviously was a dilutive to us this quarter. And over time, we'll always participate some in the mobile market, but we'll continue to manage that. Well, the one thing I'd say relative, we don't comment specifically, but we would expect to have our own inventory positions in quite balanced state. We are entering the year and we expect it to be exiting the calendar year. So to the extent you want to calculate that, that will give you a feel for it. No. The mobility side is not all equal. And part of our effort over the last several years is getting more product diversification, as Steve talked about some of the newer areas. But we will continue to maintain exposure to mobility. We will just manage that exposure and make sure we're making or we're able to make good choices as the market continues to evolve. So we see it as a long-term area of investment.  We'd see there are some very attractive parts within the mobile marketplace. So we'll continue to be investing there. We'll just be able to manage our bid allocation more broadly through this calendar year and into the future. Yes. And one thing just to comment on when I talked about 35% to 40% flash gross margins in the back half of the calendar year, that is inclusive of any potential startup costs that would still remain in the back half of the year. Yes, this is Bob. I can make a couple of comments and I don't want to start giving guidance for inventory by quarter. But we're still not satisfied with where we are on inventory in spite of the reduction that we saw this quarter. And our goal over the next few quarters is to get to at least five turns. And that's what we're focused on internally as a company. So it'll \u2013 it won't be strictly linear getting there, but we think we can achieve that fairly soon. Yes, this is Bob. I guess the first thing I would say is our gross margins are already very good in terms of capacity enterprise. And as I said earlier, is our mix tends more and more toward capacity enterprise that'll pull up our overall hard drive mix. Our mix was not as good as prior quarters, this past quarter, but you still saw the margin improvement. You saw that ASP stayed flat in spite of a tougher mix. So overall I think margins are very solid on capacity enterprise and I think as we introduced a new product, that trend will continue."

            "name": "Steve Milligan",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon. Western Digital delivered solid results in the second quarter as revenue came in at the midpoint of the guidance range and non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. Our performance reflects strong execution in our product roadmap, success in increasing our hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash environment. Notably, these results reinforce our prior comments that the June quarter marked the bottom of this flash cycle. We extended our capacity enterprise product leadership as we started sampling 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives in December. These drives feature our energy-assisted magnetic recording technology providing unrivaled areal density and TCO benefits. We expect to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the March quarter and ramp shipments through the rest of calendar 2020. Our 14-terabyte platform is performing well, and customer interest in our air based 10-terabyte drive is quite high. The strength of our capacity enterprise product portfolio will continue to allow us to maintain our leading market share position. We achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share and secured additional NVMe design wins, including at another major hyperscale customer positioning us for continued revenue growth and share gains. We made it an important announcement this afternoon of our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5, with 112 layers of vertical storage. BiCS5 joins a full portfolio of 3D NAND technologies as our highest density and most advanced 3D NAND to date, delivering exceptional performance and reliability. Our team executed well in the quarter, increasing our hard drive non-GAAP gross margins to approximately 31% from 28.5% in the prior quarter. We now expect an accelerated recovery in our flash gross margins in the first half of calendar 2020 with continued improvement through the end of the year. I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights. Yes, Wamsi, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So, there's really a couple of different things that I would say are going on in terms of the flash market. One, the first thing is as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we believe that inventory levels in \u2013 from an industry perspective to the best of our estimation have returned in the balance or call it normal levels. So, that's one thing that occurred. The other thing is, is obviously we have been working very hard on improving our product lineup, which is allowing us to sell into markets that carry higher gross margin profiles as well as their stickier business, and we believe that that will help us over time to manage the volatility that is associated with the flash business. The other thing is that, as part of all that is, is that there is an increasing awareness on behalf of our customer base that that inventory supply and demand is tightening up. In other words, demand is going to exceed supply this year. And so, we're seeing customers recognizing that. Prices are improving. Right now, that tightness is, it's kind of in pockets. It's not necessarily across the board. So we're seeing pockets of tightness in the market, and as we move through the balance of the year, we expect that that tightness will increase. And so what that means from a gross margin perspective, last quarter we said that we thought we would see modest improvement in our gross margins in the flash area. Now, we're saying that our margin profile will \u2013 it will accelerate in terms of that improvement, and I would expect as we move into the back half of the year, we'll see an increasing \u2013 more of that as the market tightens up even more in the back half of calendar 2020. What that means from a numeric perspective is that we would say that we have the opportunity for our flash gross margins to get into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the calendar year. With a bias -- Wamsi, I would add to that. With a bias for those margins improving over time as an increasing amount of our hard drive volume shifts to capacity enterprise. So what we've talked about is something in the mid-30% range. We're not necessarily saying that that will happen in this calendar year, but that should be the bias over a period of time. Yes, so I think in general, we maintain our leading market share position, call it in the kind of low to mid-50s. We'll see where this all settles out once everybody reports. We expect that to continue right through the first half of this calendar year. And then in the back half, we obviously think we have some opportunity to continue to grow slightly. So from a product positioning standpoint, we feel very good about not only our 2014, which continues to be the highest volume shipper, but the expected ramp of our 16, 18, and 20 which will occur throughout the year. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we will begin initial revenue shipments in the current quarter. And we \u2013 and Mehdi, we do have a cost advantage and we would think that, I mean, that's represented in our underlying hard drive gross profit performance. And one of the things that you're alluding to is that, our capacity enterprise drive and this continues for the 16, 18 and 20-terabyte drives that we are using aluminum media versus glass media and that is a lower cost? Yes. Hey, Karl, one thing I want to comment is, when they were talking about high 20%, I believe that was supply growth, not demand growth. So, but anyway, I'll let Mike comment on the specifics. Hence, the shortage. Yes. And I add the flash supply demand situation tightens up, we will see the mobile market become more attractive for us from a gross margin perspective. Yes. I'll comment overall on the CapEx in terms of that growth and that sort of thing. I mean, from an overall philosophical perspective, I mean, we want to be adding a bid supply to the market that is consistent largely with the overall growth from a demand perspective. So we're not \u2013 as a result of an improving environment, we're not looking at accelerating or decelerating our plans. But over a longer period of time, we would want to try to manage our growth from a supply perspective to growth and demand. And so that hasn't changed. Yes, add kind of further context to that. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to place our bits in those markets that characterize. I will call it one or two elements. One, opportunities for us to add more value from a product perspective, thereby driving higher gross margin, referring to that is, let's call it enterprise market. And then also those areas of the market that are either stickier, less volatile so that we can manage the ups and downs that tend to occur in this kind of market. Gaming, yes, it's incremental from a flash perspective, but it also tends to be stickier business, more predictable. And so it has some of those characteristics that are attractive to us as we look to place our business in more attractive parts of the market. As opposed to, let's call it more transactional or price-driven areas of the market. Well, what I commented on is that given the trajectory of our business and where we see it playing out in calendar year, we expect that our flash gross margin rate will move into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the year. Now that's not being specific as that calendar Q3 or calendar Q4 wants to see exactly how the market evolves. But we clearly continue to believe that 40% range is the right level for us and we believe that we'll begin to approach that, I mean in the back half of the calendar year. Yes. So I'll take the CEO search comment or a question, and then Mike can comment on capacity enterprise. So regarding the search, the search process is ongoing. And one of the things that I will add to that is the board is very pleased with the progress that they're making today. And so that's all the update we have for now. Yes. So I think what we're seeing is, in general demand has been very strong across fine SSD, really in the performance categories. So in some parts of the world there are some constraints there and that's being shown \u2013 that's being reflected in the movement on pricing in a positive direction. Yes. So again, all customers not created equal. There are some that are doing that, but when we aggregate it, the demand remains quite strong through the first half of the calendar year. Yes. I will comment in terms of overall industry, the extent that there's public information. But as Samsung indicated and others have indicated, we're all circling at a bit supply growth rate that's kind of in a similar neighborhood. With Samsung talking about high 20% \u2013 20% growth rate and we're talking low or mid \u2013 in low 30s. And so, we're kind of all aggregating and we're not seeing anybody adding capacity from a NAND supply perspective that would concern us, certainly not on the short term because it would take up to 18 months for that to become productive capacity. And so, we're not seeing anybody behave in a way that we think that would upset the balance from a supply demand perspective. So we feel pretty good about that. YMTC, no real change in terms of our expectations there. We do not see them having any material impact in terms of the market for the next several years. And we'll continue to evaluate that depending upon their ability to ramp, not only from a pure production standpoint, but from a technology perspective. But certainly no concerns I would say over the next two to three years in that regard. And that's kind of within the planning cycle that we would have visibility to. So let me, I'll comment at a really high level and then Mike or Bob can add a little bit more specifics. But I mean, if you look at first thing, I'm going to answer it and kind of a backdoor sort of way. If you look at our gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, which is pretty significant in terms of 25.9 to 28.5 to 29.5 in terms of the range, almost all of that is driven by improving flash environment. So namely pricing, all right. And so, and yes, there's mix improvements and that sort of thing. And so that directly impacts revenue. So when you look at an improving pricing environment that's helping us to keep our revenues, let's call it flattish on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And then beyond that, we continue to see the overall demand environment to be solid. I mean, just kind of solid, not great, not necessarily, but not bad. And so it's just kind of there and that's both a flash and a hard drive statement. And so that's allowing us to kind of work against what would be normal seasonality drop in revenue in calendar Q1. So are really kind of the two big factors. Hey Mark, good to hear your voice. All right. So thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco. Have a good rest of the day."

            "name": "Mike Cordano",
            "content": "Thank you and good afternoon. Our December results reflect solid product execution, an increase in hard drive gross margin, and an improving flash market environment.  Data Center Devices and Solutions, we executed well in delivering new products, positioning us for continued share gains and profitable growth in calendar year 2020. In capacity enterprise drives, close collaboration between our head, media, and mechanical design teams allowed us to simultaneously introduce energy-assisted magnetic recording technology and a triple-stage actuator in our new 16, 18, and 20 terabyte drives. These innovations provide us with continued areal density leadership and a greater design margin resulting in best-in-class product quality and reliability. Our focus on introducing the right technology at the right time, while delivering the best TCO and highest product quality to hyperscale and OEM customers makes us their trusted partner. In calendar year 2019, the success of our capacity enterprise product line led by our 14-terabyte drive drove over 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We also started sampling our 18-terabyte and 16-terabyte CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives and plan to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the current quarter. As these drives ramp along with our 10-terabyte air-based drives, we are well positioned for continued leadership. In flash, we achieved our goal of high-single-digit enterprise SSD market share as our NVMe based enterprise SSD revenue grew over 50% sequentially. Supply constraints limited our upside as demand was better than expected. I am encouraged to see the significant investments we have made in expanding our product portfolio over the past several years are enabling us to increase participation in higher margin, higher growth, and lower volatility parts of the flash market. We have secured additional design wins, including another major hyperscale customer, which demonstrates our success in broadening our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base. In calendar year 2020, we expect to double our enterprise SSD revenue as we move towards our goal of 20% market share. Our competitive position within the data center is unrivaled, built on the breadth of our product portfolio, strong customer relationships, technology leadership, and superior product quality. We look forward to another year of strong growth in the data center market. Client Devices, strong growth in client SSD, and smart video along with growth in mobility and desktop hard drives drove the sequential revenue growth in the December quarter. As we enter the March quarter, flash pricing continues to improve. Furthermore, starting in the June quarter, we expect to begin shipments into a new gaming platform. The gaming console market is expected to be a multi-exabyte opportunity this calendar year. Within Client Solutions, strong holiday demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions enabled revenue to grow on a sequential basis. At CES 2020, we demonstrated a range of innovative products including the world's highest capacity, pocket-sized, portable SSD and the world's first USB 3.2 SSD exclusively for gaming. This afternoon, we announced our fifth generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5. Utilizing a wide range of new technology and manufacturing innovation, BiCS5 has significantly increased cell array density horizontally across the wafer. These lateral scaling advancements in combination with 112 layers of vertical memory capability enables BiCS5 to offer up to 40% more bits of storage capacity per wafer compared to Western Digital's 96-layer BiCS4 technology. We have commenced shipping initial consumer products built on BiCS5 with mass production expected to begin later this calendar year. We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels, and with strong demand for our products we are experiencing pockets of tightness. These dynamics combined with continued product execution in both flash and hard drives position us well for continued profitable growth. I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance. Yes, BiCS4 is the overwhelming majority of bits. We're just starting the initial BiCS5 ramp. The way to think about Aaron, though, is really in this kind of 15% plus or minus annualized cost take down, and certainly we would expect that to continue as we move through this next product transition. Relative to mix, I would say both product and market segment exposure and then of course the broader ASP pricing environment are going to be the drivers of the margin enhancement through the calendar year 2020. Yes, I think you're right. It is all incremental. And from an industry standpoint and certainly from our standpoint, because we were not participating in the gaming market in 2019 calendar year, on the hard drive side. I don't think we want to go any farther than what we said in our prepared remarks, this is going to be a large multi-exabyte market and we wouldn't want to comment any more specifically. Yes. So I think from our standpoint, we think we have a significant time to market lead on 18 and 20. And so the platter count to our understanding is, distance with next generation. So our benefit relative to market share is always about bringing the right products in the market in a leading way, getting smoothly through customer qualification and ramping quickly. We've been doing that generation over generation for several years. We will do that again on the 18, 16 and 20-terabyte product that we'll be ramping this year. Yes. So all the growth, both ours and the industry is technology transition. So our K1 expansion is all about technology \u2013 room for technology transition. There is no way for capacity in our plans going in. And that's really it, I think that \u2013 across the industry. And just to comment further on where we think, we talked about low 30s in terms of supply growth, Steve commented on what Samsung's comments were. We believe demand growth will be in the 35% plus range this year. Yes. So no, we're not dependent on any specific server transition. So what we're able to do with our NVMe products is when both new server and existing socket design wins in the NVMe space. And then of course, similarly in SaaS, there'll be a series of new products announced, where we will be designed. And so we're not dependent on any particular server transition and it's really the power of and strength for the product portfolio as well as the customer's view of us as a preferred supplier that's driving that share growth. Thank you. So the broader sort of industry demand number we gave you as independent of our own share growth, right. So \u2013 and in any one of these particular segments. So our view of 35% demand side growth on the year is an aggregate across the industry per bit. While we talk about segment share gains in enterprise SSD and in gaming that's obviously product segment related gains. So we're not going to talk specifically about that. I think you can kind of calculate where we think we're going on the enterprise SSD side given my comment. Yes. So in terms of K1, I mean, we're now having real production runs and we'll continue to have more production as we progress through the year, that this last quarter we didn't have quite as larger charges we thought we were going to, I think it came in around 65 million and I think we had said on this call last quarter would be around 75 million. In the current quarter, in the March quarter, we're expecting around 70 million in terms of a period expense charge. And that should start to go down after this quarter. And it's really a function of how we ramp production and obviously ability to absorb those costs, but it'll start to get better I think from here. And relative to the capacity enterprise marketplace, our fiscal quarter one was a record a shipment for us. Our exabyte share was around 57%. We were operating to optimize both profit and maintain our kind of leading share position in this space, so some of that would be as little bit of a share drop. And I talked about that 53% to 55% depending on where things settle out. But as we looked into the first half of this calendar year, we see demand across the breadth of the market remaining fairly strong. And we think we're in a good position to maintain this leading market share position that I just talked about. So visibility is good. Obviously different customers have different plans, but when we aggregate it, we feel pretty comfortable with continued strength and demand through the first half of the calendar year. Yes. So I'll take the question on the NVMe supply constraint. It was not a flash supply constraint issue, basically what happened is the demand was better than we had expected and it was some of the components that we use in our NVMe SSD product. We've worked to resolve those and it should not be an issue as we move forward through calendar 2020. And then the other question? Yes. To Steve's comment, we actually saw a demand in excess of our availability of the actual other components. So had we been able to fully realize that? Frankly we had been in the low-double digits on share. That remedies itself as we're now inside lead time. We continue to see strong demand for those products. And as I talked about, we expect to double revenue in that category year-over-year. Yes, we haven't been too specific on that. I will say, I will give you a comment that we do see at this time a bias up in demand. So I think that's reflected in your comments. So, relative to a 35% or so annual expectation, I think our current view is a bias up from there. Let me try to clarify a little bit. We certainly see the first half of the calendar year remaining strong. I'll reference back to the comments I just made. On an annualized basis, we've been talking about 35% annualized growth. We do see on an annualized basis a bias up from there. I wouldn't want to comment kind of any further on, the way the full year or the shape of each of the individual quarters look."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew. Please go ahead, sir.\nPeter Andrew: Okay. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including product development expectations business plans trends and financial outlook. Based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements, please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, our CEO.\nSteve Milligan: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau Chief Financial Officer.Before we discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I want to spend a moment talking about the other news we announced today, after a long and fulfilling career with Western Digital spanning two decades. I have informed our Board that I plan to retire as CEO. I will continue to serve as CEO until the Board has identified and appointed a successor.Western Digital as a significantly different company than the one I first joined in 2002. We are more diversified, more resilient and much better positioned to capture the opportunities of today's evolving data marketplace.Since my appointment as CEO western Digital has transformed from a storage component provider to a diversified, enabler of data infrastructure with the broadest portfolio in the industry, offering customers a powerful combination of hard drive storage and flash memory products.We have successfully executed many key strategic initiatives including the company's acquisition of SanDisk, the integration of Western Digital, HGST and SanDisk as well as the extension and Western Digital's 19-year partnership with Kioxia. We now operate a powerful platform that uniquely positions us to provide new architectures and capabilities to manage the volume velocity and variety of data.As we think about what comes next for our company. I believe now is the right time for Western Digital to begin the transition to its next phase of leadership. Serving as Western Digital CEO for the past 7 years has truly been one of the highlights of my career; I want to thank our team for their support and dedication.I could not be prouder of what we have accomplished together and consider myself quite fortunate to have worked alongside such a talented team. In terms of next steps I look forward to continuing to work closely with the team. While the Board conducts to search for our next CEO.Given our strong management team, we expect this transition to be seamless. For our shareholders, our employees and the customers that rely on our best-in-class service and products. Once my successor is on board, I will remain with the company in an advisory role until September 2020 to ensure a smooth transition. I will also continue to serve as a Director on the Western Digital Board for a transition period after my successor is appointed.With that said, let me turn to our performance for this quarter. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start. Revenue exceeded the guidance range we provided in July, in non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. The upside was driven primarily by the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data center.We are executing well on the Data Center utilizing the power of our portfolio. At the core of our success in this market is our industry-leading capacity enterprise hard drive solutions and the exceptional value we provide to our data center customers for their diverse storage needs.During the quarter, we made two important announcements to further extend our product leadership. First, we introduced 16 and 18 terabyte CMR drives and 20 terabyte SMR drive all enabled by our energy assisted recording technology, these drives are expected the sample this quarter.Additionally, through our continued investments in heads, media and mechanical design. We began shipping an air based 10 terabyte drive providing significant benefits to our customers.I am pleased to announce we commenced the initial revenue ramp of our MBME based enterprise SSDs to major hyper-scale and OEM customers during the September quarter. Efforts to qualify and ramp additional customers with our next generation products based on our 96 layer 3D flash technology are going well and should position us to further increase our participation in this important market.Western Digital's ability to offer both hard drives and flash flash-based solutions differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to more strategically partner with our data center customers. Outside the data center the overall demand environment across the consumer, mobile, PC and retail end markets is solid.Furthermore, we are seeing improving trends across our flash product portfolio and continue to believe that the flash industry has passed a cyclical trough. With the broad and growing product portfolio western Digital remains well positioned to benefit from the long-term drivers of the growth in value of data.With that I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.\nMike Cordano: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement. I value and appreciate the partnership we have built together over the past decade and want to acknowledge Steve for his leadership and numerous contributions to Western Digital.We have quite a bit of time and work to do between now and September of next year and look forward to working together to execute on our plans. As Steve mentioned, fiscal 2020 is off to a good start.We had record hard drive exabyte shipments driven by the success of our capacity enterprise drive family. We also had record exabyte shipments in the flash as we benefited from demand elasticity in share gains and SSDs for PCs and notebooks.In Data Center Devices and Solutions our capacity enterprise exabytes shipment growth was over 60% year-over-year, led by the ramp of our 14 terabyte drives. These drives now represent the majority of our capacity enterprise unit and exabyte shipments. Industry analysts expect the 14 terabyte capacity point to be the industry's highest volume product through the first half of calendar year 2020.Building on our aerial density leadership and execution on mechanical design, we announced our plan to accelerate the introduction of our 9 platter energy assisted capacity enterprise drive platform.This enables us to ship 16 and 18 terabyte CMR and 20 terabyte SMR drives on a unified platform, simplifying the qualification process and reducing the time to market for our customers.We will be sampling all of these drives by the end of this quarter and we will commence volume shipments in the first half of calendar 2020. In addition, we began shipping a new 10 terabyte air-based product powered by our innovative air flow architecture, underscoring our aerial density and mechanical design leadership.Given the strength of our capacity enterprise portfolio and the opportunities we see in this market. We now believe our exabyte shipment growth will exceed 40% in calendar year 2019, up from our prior estimate of 30%. In enterprise SSDs our NDME based products experienced a strong quarter of growth and we expect continued growth in the December quarter.We are qualifying our next generation 96 layer product with additional customers, which positions us for further market share gains in calendar year 2020 and beyond.We have a unique and sustainable competitive advantage within the data center built on strong customer relationships and a strong product portfolio. Our strategic position within this important end market will drive future revenue growth.In Client Solutions revenue grew on a sequential basis, driven by an improving pricing environment and a seasonal increase in bit shipments. This quarter we began shipping 96 layer QLC based retail products and external SSDs.The Trust and reputation of our brand and our customers preference for the performance and reliability of our solutions are key differentiators. In Client Devices the main contributor to our year-over-year decline was our decision to limit our participation in the mobile market.On a sequential basis, we expect to ship more bits into the mobile market in the December quarter. In PCs and notebooks, we gained market share and client SSDs as our exabytes shipment growth exceeded 70% year-over-year.Our bit production of 96 BiCS4 surpassed 64 BiCS3 during the September quarter. We are on track to commercialize BiCS4 across all our product lines by the end of calendar 2019. Our JV partner K1 fab and Western Digital executed well bringing the Yokkaichi fabs back to full production after the power outage limiting output reduction four exabytes.Our flash supply is tight and we continue to believe that any excess inventory in the flash industry supply chain will be substantially reduced by the end of calendar 2019. We expect flash industry supply bit growth to be in the mid 20% range in calendar 2019. And in the low 30% range in calendar 2020.In addition to continued growth in our existing flash portfolio and capacity enterprise markets, we see several new incremental growth opportunities. First, the launch of the next generation gaming consoles will be important events for the gaming industry and our flash business, we expect these new console to utilize high capacity flash storage to improve the gaming experience.Second, we expect to expand our product portfolio and diversify our customer base for the mobile market with our UFS, eMMC and custom solutions. Finally our recent announcements of 3D flash products for the automotive and industrial markets will further expand our opportunities in these growing and more stable flash-based markets.I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.\nBob Eulau: Thanks, Mike. I also want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement and look forward to helping to enable a seamless transition to the next CEO. I'm pleased to announce the revenue for the September quarter exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided in July and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the high end of the range.Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. This was up 11% sequentially as we experienced growth in Data Center Devices and Solutions and client Solutions. Revenue was down 20% year-over-year as we faced a tough compare tough comparable quarter in fiscal 2019, by end-markets Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue increased 20% sequentially and 6% year-over-year due to the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data centers.Please recall that a year ago based on discussions with our customers we predicted that in the second half of calendar 2019. We would return to growth in capacity enterprise. We are experiencing that predicted rebound now. On a sequential basis client solutions revenue grew 18% on seasonally stronger flash bit shipments and a stronger flash pricing environment.Client Solutions revenue declined 4% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in hard drive TAM. Client Devices revenue was up 1% on a sequential basis and decreased 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was a result of our decision to scale back flash bit shipments to the mobile market, flash price declines and a reduction in the hard drive TAM.By product category, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 36% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were flat and bit shipments were up 9% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year, average price per hard drive was $81. Exabyte shipments were up 23% sequentially, hitting a new record level.As we move on to costs and expenses; please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the September quarter was 24.8% with a flash gross margin of 19.3% and our hard drive gross margin of 28.5%. We completed all of our cost of revenue reduction activities we outlined in January, resulting in a decrease of more than $100 million in quarterly spending.The hard drive gross margin was up slightly from the June quarter and we expect the December quarter gross margin to be approximately 30% as we fully realize the benefits of the cost reduction efforts.Flash, gross margin was up on a sequential basis as we benefited from a better flash pricing environment. K1 fab cost was $64 million higher than expected. Excluded from the cost of revenue was a $68 million charge related to the power outage.Operating expenses were $767 million. Adjusting for a normal 13 week quarter operating expenses were below the $740 million run rate target. During the quarter we completed all of our operating expense reduction efforts announced in January.In addition, once we complete the exit of our storage systems business, we should start to see an approximately $25 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses beginning in the March quarter.Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $253 million and free cash flow was $294 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were inflow of $41 million.As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds flowing back and forth between us and the joint venture. From a full fiscal year, we continue to expect capital expenditures that will flow through our cash flow statement to be under $500 million.Total capital expenditures, which include our portion of joint venture leasing and self operating funding is expected to be similar to last fiscal year between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. In the September quarter, we distributed $147 million in dividends to our shareholders. We paid down debt by $319 million which included an optional $250 million debt pay down. As our cash generation continues to improve.Our first priority will be to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After paying our dividend our next priority will be to reduce our debt. At the end of the quarter we have $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, our $2.25 billion revolver remains unused and our gross debt outstanding was $10.4 billion.Total inventory dollars were flat on a sequential basis, but higher than projected as a joint venture fab recovered faster than expected. This resulted in a sequential increase in flash inventory, particularly at the end of the quarter while hard drive inventory declined about $100 million sequentially.Moving on [Technical Difficulty] with the guidance. So again this is non-GAAP guidance and as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 25% to 26%. Please note that this range includes approximately $75 million in costs associated with the K1 fab.Operating expenses are expected to be between $750 million and $770 million above the $748 million run rate target due to higher variable compensation spending. We expect interest and other expense of $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be 26% plus or minus 2 points. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.45 and $0.65 assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares.With that I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And Steve, congrats on the retirement has been great working with you. Two questions if I can, real quick. So first of all I guess one of the things that stands out a little bit is the capacity shipment number on flash up only about 9% sequential. By my math that's up maybe high single digits on a year-over-year basis.So can you talk a little bit about, it seems like the product portfolio is in a great position and ramping client SSD, capacity shipments were strong. I'm just curious of why we, it seems to be a little bit muted. As far as the capacity shipment trends and flash. And what's your expectation going into the December quarter for capacity ship?\nMike Cordano: So Aaron, let me address that. So the primary reason for that is really the point that I made and Bob made in our comments is we did not participate in a substantial way in the mobile marketplace in the quarter just completed. So that's the primary driver of bit shipment in the quarter.\nSteve Milligan: And Aaron, recall - this is Steve. Recall, that that lack of participation in the mobile market was by choice. From our standpoint given that the profitability levels for that segment of the market, we're not at all attractive.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. And then as a second question on near capacity enterprise drives in the slide deck. You know that you now expect the overall the market to quote unquote approach 30% year-over-year growth. I think last quarter you talked about growth meaningfully exceeding that 30% level. I know you guys are talking about north of 40% growth in your capacity shipments.But what's changed over the last quarter, is there have been a bit of a softening in terms of your expectation. I guess, going into the December quarter. What's really driving that change of growth expectations?\nMike Cordano: So, Aaron I think for us, we actually updated our performance on the year. We originally had stated last quarter, we'd be north of 30% for us. We updated that guidance north of 40. We're actually seeing strength in exabyte consumption across the capacity enterprise segment.Now the other thing that's happening for us is more unique is the power of the 14 terabyte product is doing quite well. And obviously we are gaining market share in that segment that's showing up on an exabyte basis.\nAaron Rakers: It is under constraints in the market, which is tempering the overall market, the industry expectation?\nSteve Milligan: No, I think we would suggest the industry will grow at north of 30, we will grow at north of 40 and again that's all up from our last outlook on both numbers.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you. And Steve good luck with your next endeavor and was very nice working with you. Moving on to questions. Just to follow up. It's very helpful when you talk about exabyte shipment guide, especially for the near-line and as you look into the next year, how do you see that exabyte shipment target changing and again this is for 2020 versus 2019 and how should we think about the mix of the near line exabyte as a percentage of the overall exabyte shipment for Western Digital.\nMike Cordano: Yeah, so let me just comment specifically capacity enterprise. We would expect for 2020, our current outlook is about 35% year-over-year growth. So continued strength year-over-year and so we don't split out total HDD exabyte growth, we don't specify them.\nSteve Milligan: And by the way many then 35% is consistent with our longer term expectations.\nMike Cordano: Sure. You kind of pre-into my prepared question as by saying that you didn't participate in the mobile segment as it relates to your NAND shipment and there is a debate as to what happens to that inventory in the channel reserved mobiles segment, as you look into the March quarter.So with that as the background, how do you see the supply and demand in NAND looking into the March quarter and I'm not asking for a guide. I just want to better understand your view you didn't participate in the market and in that context, how do you see your prices trending into March quarter.\nSteve Milligan: Yeah. So we'll take that maybe we first off, as we indicated, we believe that we passed the trough in terms of the flash cycle. In the overall inventory situation is improving and other words supply is getting much more aligned to demand, and we would expect that largely for ourselves and for the industry as we exit the December quarter that things will be fairly imbalanced now when you move into the March quarter.And let me actually broaden that question a bit, when you move into the first half of the year. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that we will see a typical seasonal decline in terms of from a demand perspective. Supply is relatively linear.And so we will have to just like we do largely every year in terms of the calendar cyclicality, we'll have to manage through that, but then as we move to the back half of the year where we will see.And this is the back half of calendar year a calendar year 20, we will see that begin to flip demand will begin to improve and we will see rather than modest improvement in our financial results that we've been saying, we should see an accelerating improvement in our performance from a financial perspective, as we move into the back half of calendar 2020.\nMike Cordano: Mehdi, I will just give you some numbers to work with there. We talked about low '30s on supply bit growth. We would expect demand for the calendar year to be slightly above that.\nMike Cordano: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. And Steve again congrats on your retirement and best of luck in your future endeavors. Two questions if I may. Taking mobile for a moment, you referenced that mobile margins have not been attractive for the last two quarters but is that because you don't have captive DRAM.I guess, how important is that, is it for you to have either captive DRAM or a new long-term supply agreement for DRAM and you contemplate your competitive position in smart phones over time.\nSteve Milligan: Yeah, let me answer that. So let me delineate mobile. So there is the discrete and component part of mobile and then there is the MCP which includes DRAM. I think, strategically, we do not see MCP is a long-term strategic place for us to operate. We're focusing our\u2026\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Speaker?\nSteve Milligan: Yes. Sorry, can you hear us now?\nOperator: Yes, we can.\nSteve Milligan: Okay, let me back up and repeat that. I don't know where we dropped off. Our mobile market participation let me break into two components. One is the MCP business that includes DRAM, the second is discrete and component participation in mobile end-use applications.Strategically we've moved away from product investment in MCP and over the longer horizon. It's not an area of product focus for us. So when we talk about participation is that, for us the discrete business which we chose for economic reasons to minimize our participation as we had higher value places to put our bets. So we see that sequentially improving and the economics in mobile improving along with other segments of the market.\nKarl Ackerman: That's helpful, Mike. As my follow-up shifting gears to gross margins for a moment. Clearly you and your peers are operating well below normalized run rates in NAND. At the same time so I think your outlook for hard drive gross margins are good. But still a little bit below where we were roughly a year ago.I guess we'll be exit of the systems business or areas of the systems business be the primary driver for gross margin improvement in hard drives, and I guess how do we think about the margin implications from the incremental disk and heads on those higher capacity drives. Thank you.\nSteve Milligan: Yeah, so I'll address that. And then Bob and Mike can join in and add any additional color. So the first thing is the exiting in the system business will have no material impact one way or the other on our gross margins. So if you look at our hard drive gross margins. I mean, let's be clear about that. Our hard drive gross margins, although good levels are not where we want them to be.We want those hard drive gross margins to be north of 30% in the low 30% range. We are still dealing with some of the cost overhang of exiting our [indiscernible] manufacturing facility. That is now behind us. And so we should see our drive margins improve into that low 30% range as we exit this the December quarter and then obviously, our intent is to sustain and possibly improve that over a period of time.Flash, gross margins are clearly not where we want them to be. They are improving albeit at a slow rate. We would continue to expect as we see this sort of ripple through the market because different customers started at different levels, different market started at different levels.The pace of that improvement is not linear for all of those aspects. But we'll continue to see steady improvement in our flash margins this quarter and then into subsequent quarters. And as I indicated earlier, we expect that improvement to improve at a improved rate at a better rate as we move into the second half of calendar 2020.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I have follow ups around gross margins and maybe versus to better understand the outlook for NAND and that it get the guiding for margins to improve somewhat, next quarter. You sort of understand around ASPs on a like-for-like basis, if you can give more color on what you're assuming there given the comments about a cyclical bottom?\nSteve Milligan: Yeah, I can start. And first of all, I want to remind you on the NAND side. We do have a headwind with the K1 startup costs and bringing up that fab and we are beginning production there. But there is probably in the neighborhood of 3.0 headwinds that we're faced with on the NAND side. And as we've ramped volume, then obviously the margins will improve everything else being equal.So in terms of a flash overall as we get to equilibrium between supply and demand, we're definitely expecting that the pricing will get better as we move through 20. Mike or Steve was saying. So I think it will take a little bit of time to work through that, but I think we're going to be a good price.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then my follow-up was on the hard drive gross margin again along the lines of the prior questioning. I have been under the impression that for the December quarter, hard drive gross margins could hit 30% especially given the upside that the company has seen the near line business, which I think typically runs at least 30%, if not higher.Is there anything in terms of increased headwinds around gross margins of the company has seen in the December quarter. This maybe keeping hard drive gross margins under 30% or was kind of the wrong impression about the ability to hit 30% with my previous expectations for the December.\nSteve Milligan: Let me, because I get kind of this one I feel strongly about. We will -- we are intent is to have gross margins north of 30% for our hard drive business this quarter, the December quarter. And so there is no headwind at present, of course, there can be things that will happen. But there's nothing at present that indicates that we won't hit that level.\nMike Cordano: And the other thing I would add, Marc is, if you look out over time we expect more and more growth in terms of capacity enterprise will become a bigger percentage of our overall mix and that will help the margins go up as well.\nMark Delaney: Got it. That's it, thank you very much. And Steve good luck with your future endeavors.\nSteve Milligan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I think on the folks a, just on the gross margin kind of the NAND inflection. I think a lot of people looking for kind of like $0.80 or even $1 for in December quarter guide you the improving memory environment.So I guess maybe can you help us at least understand how you guys think at the inflection in terms of how much leverage, you're going to get on the gross margin side, if we look out, let's say 3 or 4 quarters. And I'm trying to understand the comment about how you're going to see a more material inflection in the back half for calendar '20?\nSteve Milligan: So a couple of things. Let me talk about the dynamics in the current period. We talked about. So when we look at where we started from all end markets in flash were not created equal relative to pricing and margin. We also noted that mobile was a inferior performing segment for us. We are taking more of that on this quarter, as a percentage of the total. So that is having a bit of a headwind, relative to the flash margin in the current quarter.To Steve's comments earlier on 2020 we see supply demand in pretty good shape as we come into 2020. But the normal seasonality of the year we got to make sure we're managing through that in a cautious way and we expect that is a year moves on. As we head towards the middle of the year in the back end that will continue to improve in the rate of margin improvement in flash will accelerate in the back half of the year.\nMitch Steves: Okay. And then in terms of the NAND gross margin is that go back to like '30s in the back half of 20. I mean, just any sort of rough metric would be helpful?\nSteve Milligan: Well, we are, I mean, let me be clear on this we're not providing guidance beyond what we've done in terms of flash gross margins. But I'll tell you where we need to get to and where we want to get to is back to where flash gross margins are in that 40% range.That that's a margin level that we view as attainable over a period of time and it's also a margin level that we believe is required to get sufficient return on the capital that we are investing in this business. So that's where we want to head to.\nMitch Steves: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore.\nCJ Muse: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins. Specific to the NAND side, can you quantify the K1 fab costs in the September quarter. I think you said $75 million in the December quarter and how we should think about that progressing into 2020. And then I guess as a second question there on the flash bit side, it looks like implied in there. Given these costs roughly bit growth of only 10% or so in the quarter.So it looks like you're really growing about 19%, 20% for the year versus many of your competitors who are suggesting low '30s for the industry and so I guess is that a function of just deciding not to want to play in the mobility side, is it a function of not having the right bids or is there something else. Thank you.\nSteve Milligan: Now, let me, let me address the last question first. In terms of us growing and first off, the big growth that we're seeing from a demand of revenue perspective is consistent with previous expectations. It hasn't changed and by the way, one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that we took a meaningful amount of production offline starting earlier this year. Independent of the power outage because we saw the oversupply conditions well, we saw it coming.And we saw that situation being let's just call it untenable and so we were reducing our bit output from a supply perspective to help offset that growth that unnecessary growth from a supply perspective that created the substantial price decline that we in the industry realized in the back half of ' 18 and also into 2019.\nMike Cordano: So I ask Bob to address. So CJ in terms of the September quarter that we just finished the K1 costs were at $64 million and what I said in the guidance as we expect in the December quarter. That will be in the neighborhood of $75 million. We think they will start to come down from that point in time. But this is, I mean this is new production capacity we're putting in place, it becomes a part of our fixed cost over time.\nBob Eulau: Yeah C.J one other comment I'll make is when you think about this on a bit share comparative basis when you think about it from a bit capacity output basis. Obviously, we continue to remain in the same proximity a ratio to others. So this was simply us choosing to not produce very low margin product for the as reasons [indiscernible]\nCJ Muse: It makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: Excuse me. Good afternoon and sorry for another gross margin question, but maybe\u2026\nSteve Milligan: We have to start banning gross margin question.\nSteven Fox: Yeah, I know last one. Let me get this in. So in terms of just the mix impact on NAND gross margins, can you maybe talk a little bit about what's going on, how mix is affecting the gross margin guidance for the current quarter versus what you just reported NAND gross margins and then along similar lines, you mentioned some incremental growth next year from things like next generation gaming and industrial.Can you talk about their mix impact on gross margins? And if I did I get it in one more given what you said about the first half of the calendar year, are you able to at least hold gross margins around current levels or based on what you do with where you choose to put your bids or do we backtrack a little? Thank you.\nBob Eulau: Well I'm going to address the last question first. We would expect that our profitability levels certainly from a margin percentage standpoint will continue to modestly improve as we move into the first half of the year.\nMike Cordano: Okay. And back to the mix. Let me just reiterate within the flash business, we're taking on a greater proportion mobile business this quarter, which is a margin drag and is dampening our sequential margin performance, to some degree. On the flash side and then Bob also talked about the fact startup. So those two things are affecting the flash margin in this quarter.When we go into 2020 certainly a number of the new markets are good bit consumers the gaming business, we think that that is going to be not only a good consumer of bits but at reasonably attractive margins and industrial and automotive are even better yet relative to margins and more stable non-cyclical.\nSteve Milligan: And yeah -- Bob already indicated that the K1 costs are kind of a 3-point drag and then if you neutralize for mix. I think that we would all be seeing a much more satisfying increase in our flash margins when you neutralize for those two items. And I think that's important for all of us to keep that in mind, the trajectory is in the right direction. It's just that there are other moving parts that tend to mask those improving trends.\nSteven Fox: Got it. And Steve congrats on all your accomplishments at Western Digital. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great, thanks. Maybe one more question on this, on the flash side, I know you talk about few times about strategically walking away from the mobile mix, can you remind us your mix within the NAND flash business today and how do you think that will change a year from now. Is there more tailwinds coming from this mix change in mix, and what are the areas that have better margins of worth more than the average for the business?\nSteve Milligan: So we don't specifically disclose the ratio of flash participation. But I can give you some color on relative performance, certainly the areas a big investment for us that we emphasize our own where we want to grow our participation. So enterprise SSD fast growing higher overall margins than the average over time. Industrial embedded both similarly situation in the higher margins.Good growth rates and then ultimately certain segments of mobile over time are attractive and we're focused on those. Hence our UFS product investment, so the higher end higher performance part of that marketplace. So we put a big emphasis on quality of revenue and seeking out those higher margin more stable end markets and those will be examples that we're focused on.\nSidney Ho: Great. My follow-up question; I'm sure you welcome a hard drive question. The last earnings call, you talked about introducing 16 terabyte CMR and as 18 terabyte SMR. But you ended up launching a higher capacity about two months later, can you talk about why you made that change in the roadmap and what kind of feedback are you getting from your customers so far?\nSteve Milligan: Yeah. So the reason that we made that decision and it's actually quite simple is that we, we made faster progress in terms of our 9 platter platform than what we had previously anticipated. And so the advancements that we were making from a mechanical perspective allowed us to pull in that platform sooner than what we anticipated, which was favorably received by our customers from a market place perspective, which I'll ask Mike to elaborate on.\nMike Cordano: Yeah. And I think a number of dimensions of this. Obviously, it gets them to 18 and 20 terabyte sooner than they would have otherwise. So the TCO benefit when you combine cost per bit with the other elements like slot tax because you know you eliminate some slots required and also the quality that we deliver with our products, the whole economic equation is better and then we talked about, we get a multi platform qualification.So for them their ability to qualify a single platform that covers all of those configurations is both a simplifying of their efforts on cost reduction of their efforts and it gets us to market earlier. So all positive trends from the customers' perspective and getting to that new 18 terabyte CMR in 20 terabyte SMR capacity earlier is a big value.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, thanks guys for taking the questions. And Steve, congrats as well for me, I know we have a little more time with you, but it's certainly been, I do have a gross margin question guys. But I'm going to start with the hyperscale question just provide some the leaf here. So first a clarification, the comment earlier in the Q&A about 35% growth for calendar ' 20 year-over-year was that your hyperscale outlook for calendar ' 20 or was that another.\nSteve Milligan: No, that's -- yeah that's total capacity enterprise. So hyperscale and OEM consumption of that class together.\nAnanda Baruah: Thanks for that. And could you update for us. You have an updated view on what this cycle might look like this hyperscale cycle might look like. Now, I think you made some comments the last couple of quarters.\nSteve Milligan: Yeah, I think the only thing we can say as we continue to see strength of the cycle. End of the first half of 20. I don't think we want to go any beyond that that supported in the 35% year over year growth parameters. So we don't see enrolling over yet. No.\nAnanda Baruah: And the, any sense, if the incremental strength is pro in for this year it's been a little bit stronger than we thought is pull into this year your -- point to sustainability as we move kind of move into the March quarter.\nSteve Milligan: So it would point to sustainability end of the first half of the calendar year '20.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay, that's great. And then just quickly on the flash gross margin. So as we think about the different layers of the headwind that could roll off, it sounds like there is the mobile and that 300, sorry the K1 doing the basically spread, but it sounds like as you participate more mobile of the headwinds will diminish sort of incoming quarters before we get the inflection in few quarters, will the K1 cost with the 300 basis points headwind. Will that also kind of gradually roll off until we get into September quarter?And then whether the other levers that will also contribute to the gradual expansion in margin before we get into the second half of next year. I just don't want to miss anything. I want to make sure I'm understanding it appropriately. Thanks.\nSteve Milligan: Yeah. So I'll start with the K1 question. So right now I mean we're just beginning production in that fab and so it will be a gradual improvement in absorption over the next few quarters and eventually it will be fully absorbed and have a cost structure. Similar to what we experienced elsewhere.\nMike Cordano: Yeah, I think the other drivers are really looking at the individual segments. And as I talked about, we are continuing to expand the product portfolio and increased participation and let's call it higher quality revenue segments like enterprise SSD and other sort of high-end mobile marketplaces as we progress into 2020. So think of it is customer and product mix improvements as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.\nVijay Rakesh: Yeah, hi, thanks guys, congrats Steven, and good luck with your next endeavors. Just on the flash side. I was wondering going back on the gross margin, and that's the last question here, if you could look at, you said you're trying to exit the mobile segments but wondering as you look at first half, do you expect to step up as exit some of this mobile segments in what kind of margin improvement should expect on the flash side with as you move more into the SSD, or less price sensitive markets and same question is on that, sorry go ahead.\nSteve Milligan: Well, I was going to respond to that. I'm sorry. But, so let me clarify. We have not exited from the mobile market, we chose not to participate in segments of that market for a period of time because the margins, it was not, it made and made no economic sense. Okay. As we see the pricing environment in that market. Begin to stabilize and improve consistent with improving supply and demand dynamics, we will be increasing our participation in that market starting this quarter.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the hard to strive side you've got talked about 16 and trade, but can you give us some color of how, when you expect to ramp some of those products as you go through 2020. Thanks.\nMike Cordano: Yeah. So obviously we said we're sampling those in the current quarter and we expect to ramp that in the first half of calendar ' 20 so that's in the not too distant future.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you. Just for verification purposes here or education purposes. What is the NAND flash industry typically seasonally peak in terms of bit demand from a monthly perspective?\nSteve Milligan: Well, I mean this selling a answer. It's the old adage that the best quarter of the year is October, November and December, it's around that time but I don't know, literally which month.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And so, Mike, I think you made a comment that the exabyte loss from the power outage turned out to be 4 exabyte, 6 exabytes but you still expect that the excess inventory industry wide would be flushed out by the end of this year. So given that lower exabyte loss, have you seen better demand and expected over the past three months.\nSteve Milligan: So I think in general, our bit consumption of demand has been at or a well above what we thought. So our comments were we thought. By the end of the year the industry inventories would be substantially improved and we stand by that.\nNehal Chokshi: And what's been the driver of that better-than-expected demand for the NAND Flash bits?\nSteve Milligan: I think we've seen generally speaking, some a little bit better mix in terms of capacity per unit. And I think some of the end markets are a little more robust than maybe we originally expected, including mobile.\nNehal Chokshi: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Speakers I'm showing no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nPeter Andrew: All right. Thank you for joining us today. I would also like to extend a thank you to all of our employees, customers and business partners. We look forward to a successful year together. Have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I also want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement and look forward to helping to enable a seamless transition to the next CEO. I'm pleased to announce the revenue for the September quarter exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided in July and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the high end of the range.Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. This was up 11% sequentially as we experienced growth in Data Center Devices and Solutions and client Solutions. Revenue was down 20% year-over-year as we faced a tough compare tough comparable quarter in fiscal 2019, by end-markets Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue increased 20% sequentially and 6% year-over-year due to the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data centers.Please recall that a year ago based on discussions with our customers we predicted that in the second half of calendar 2019. We would return to growth in capacity enterprise. We are experiencing that predicted rebound now. On a sequential basis client solutions revenue grew 18% on seasonally stronger flash bit shipments and a stronger flash pricing environment.Client Solutions revenue declined 4% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in hard drive TAM. Client Devices revenue was up 1% on a sequential basis and decreased 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was a result of our decision to scale back flash bit shipments to the mobile market, flash price declines and a reduction in the hard drive TAM.By product category, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 36% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were flat and bit shipments were up 9% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year, average price per hard drive was $81. Exabyte shipments were up 23% sequentially, hitting a new record level.As we move on to costs and expenses; please note all my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the September quarter was 24.8% with a flash gross margin of 19.3% and our hard drive gross margin of 28.5%. We completed all of our cost of revenue reduction activities we outlined in January, resulting in a decrease of more than $100 million in quarterly spending.The hard drive gross margin was up slightly from the June quarter and we expect the December quarter gross margin to be approximately 30% as we fully realize the benefits of the cost reduction efforts.Flash, gross margin was up on a sequential basis as we benefited from a better flash pricing environment. K1 fab cost was $64 million higher than expected. Excluded from the cost of revenue was a $68 million charge related to the power outage.Operating expenses were $767 million. Adjusting for a normal 13 week quarter operating expenses were below the $740 million run rate target. During the quarter we completed all of our operating expense reduction efforts announced in January.In addition, once we complete the exit of our storage systems business, we should start to see an approximately $25 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses beginning in the March quarter.Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $253 million and free cash flow was $294 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash ventures on our cash flow statement were inflow of $41 million.As previously noted, we are benefiting from the timing of the funds flowing back and forth between us and the joint venture. From a full fiscal year, we continue to expect capital expenditures that will flow through our cash flow statement to be under $500 million.Total capital expenditures, which include our portion of joint venture leasing and self operating funding is expected to be similar to last fiscal year between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. In the September quarter, we distributed $147 million in dividends to our shareholders. We paid down debt by $319 million which included an optional $250 million debt pay down. As our cash generation continues to improve.Our first priority will be to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After paying our dividend our next priority will be to reduce our debt. At the end of the quarter we have $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, our $2.25 billion revolver remains unused and our gross debt outstanding was $10.4 billion.Total inventory dollars were flat on a sequential basis, but higher than projected as a joint venture fab recovered faster than expected. This resulted in a sequential increase in flash inventory, particularly at the end of the quarter while hard drive inventory declined about $100 million sequentially.Moving on [Technical Difficulty] with the guidance. So again this is non-GAAP guidance and as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 25% to 26%. Please note that this range includes approximately $75 million in costs associated with the K1 fab.Operating expenses are expected to be between $750 million and $770 million above the $748 million run rate target due to higher variable compensation spending. We expect interest and other expense of $85 million and we expect the tax rate to be 26% plus or minus 2 points. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per share between $0.45 and $0.65 assuming approximately $302 million in fully diluted shares.With that I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question. Yeah C.J one other comment I'll make is when you think about this on a bit share comparative basis when you think about it from a bit capacity output basis. Obviously, we continue to remain in the same proximity a ratio to others. So this was simply us choosing to not produce very low margin product for the as reasons [indiscernible] Well I'm going to address the last question first. We would expect that our profitability levels certainly from a margin percentage standpoint will continue to modestly improve as we move into the first half of the year."

            "name": "Steve Milligan",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau Chief Financial Officer.Before we discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I want to spend a moment talking about the other news we announced today, after a long and fulfilling career with Western Digital spanning two decades. I have informed our Board that I plan to retire as CEO. I will continue to serve as CEO until the Board has identified and appointed a successor.Western Digital as a significantly different company than the one I first joined in 2002. We are more diversified, more resilient and much better positioned to capture the opportunities of today's evolving data marketplace.Since my appointment as CEO western Digital has transformed from a storage component provider to a diversified, enabler of data infrastructure with the broadest portfolio in the industry, offering customers a powerful combination of hard drive storage and flash memory products.We have successfully executed many key strategic initiatives including the company's acquisition of SanDisk, the integration of Western Digital, HGST and SanDisk as well as the extension and Western Digital's 19-year partnership with Kioxia. We now operate a powerful platform that uniquely positions us to provide new architectures and capabilities to manage the volume velocity and variety of data.As we think about what comes next for our company. I believe now is the right time for Western Digital to begin the transition to its next phase of leadership. Serving as Western Digital CEO for the past 7 years has truly been one of the highlights of my career; I want to thank our team for their support and dedication.I could not be prouder of what we have accomplished together and consider myself quite fortunate to have worked alongside such a talented team. In terms of next steps I look forward to continuing to work closely with the team. While the Board conducts to search for our next CEO.Given our strong management team, we expect this transition to be seamless. For our shareholders, our employees and the customers that rely on our best-in-class service and products. Once my successor is on board, I will remain with the company in an advisory role until September 2020 to ensure a smooth transition. I will also continue to serve as a Director on the Western Digital Board for a transition period after my successor is appointed.With that said, let me turn to our performance for this quarter. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start. Revenue exceeded the guidance range we provided in July, in non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range. The upside was driven primarily by the success of our capacity enterprise drives for the data center.We are executing well on the Data Center utilizing the power of our portfolio. At the core of our success in this market is our industry-leading capacity enterprise hard drive solutions and the exceptional value we provide to our data center customers for their diverse storage needs.During the quarter, we made two important announcements to further extend our product leadership. First, we introduced 16 and 18 terabyte CMR drives and 20 terabyte SMR drive all enabled by our energy assisted recording technology, these drives are expected the sample this quarter.Additionally, through our continued investments in heads, media and mechanical design. We began shipping an air based 10 terabyte drive providing significant benefits to our customers.I am pleased to announce we commenced the initial revenue ramp of our MBME based enterprise SSDs to major hyper-scale and OEM customers during the September quarter. Efforts to qualify and ramp additional customers with our next generation products based on our 96 layer 3D flash technology are going well and should position us to further increase our participation in this important market.Western Digital's ability to offer both hard drives and flash flash-based solutions differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to more strategically partner with our data center customers. Outside the data center the overall demand environment across the consumer, mobile, PC and retail end markets is solid.Furthermore, we are seeing improving trends across our flash product portfolio and continue to believe that the flash industry has passed a cyclical trough. With the broad and growing product portfolio western Digital remains well positioned to benefit from the long-term drivers of the growth in value of data.With that I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights. And Aaron, recall - this is Steve. Recall, that that lack of participation in the mobile market was by choice. From our standpoint given that the profitability levels for that segment of the market, we're not at all attractive. No, I think we would suggest the industry will grow at north of 30, we will grow at north of 40 and again that's all up from our last outlook on both numbers. And by the way many then 35% is consistent with our longer term expectations. Yeah. So we'll take that maybe we first off, as we indicated, we believe that we passed the trough in terms of the flash cycle. In the overall inventory situation is improving and other words supply is getting much more aligned to demand, and we would expect that largely for ourselves and for the industry as we exit the December quarter that things will be fairly imbalanced now when you move into the March quarter.And let me actually broaden that question a bit, when you move into the first half of the year. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that we will see a typical seasonal decline in terms of from a demand perspective. Supply is relatively linear.And so we will have to just like we do largely every year in terms of the calendar cyclicality, we'll have to manage through that, but then as we move to the back half of the year where we will see.And this is the back half of calendar year a calendar year 20, we will see that begin to flip demand will begin to improve and we will see rather than modest improvement in our financial results that we've been saying, we should see an accelerating improvement in our performance from a financial perspective, as we move into the back half of calendar 2020. Yeah, let me answer that. So let me delineate mobile. So there is the discrete and component part of mobile and then there is the MCP which includes DRAM. I think, strategically, we do not see MCP is a long-term strategic place for us to operate. We're focusing our... Yes. Sorry, can you hear us now? Okay, let me back up and repeat that. I don't know where we dropped off. Our mobile market participation let me break into two components. One is the MCP business that includes DRAM, the second is discrete and component participation in mobile end-use applications.Strategically we've moved away from product investment in MCP and over the longer horizon. It's not an area of product focus for us. So when we talk about participation is that, for us the discrete business which we chose for economic reasons to minimize our participation as we had higher value places to put our bets. So we see that sequentially improving and the economics in mobile improving along with other segments of the market. Yeah, so I'll address that. And then Bob and Mike can join in and add any additional color. So the first thing is the exiting in the system business will have no material impact one way or the other on our gross margins. So if you look at our hard drive gross margins. I mean, let's be clear about that. Our hard drive gross margins, although good levels are not where we want them to be.We want those hard drive gross margins to be north of 30% in the low 30% range. We are still dealing with some of the cost overhang of exiting our [indiscernible] manufacturing facility. That is now behind us. And so we should see our drive margins improve into that low 30% range as we exit this the December quarter and then obviously, our intent is to sustain and possibly improve that over a period of time.Flash, gross margins are clearly not where we want them to be. They are improving albeit at a slow rate. We would continue to expect as we see this sort of ripple through the market because different customers started at different levels, different market started at different levels.The pace of that improvement is not linear for all of those aspects. But we'll continue to see steady improvement in our flash margins this quarter and then into subsequent quarters. And as I indicated earlier, we expect that improvement to improve at a improved rate at a better rate as we move into the second half of calendar 2020. Yeah, I can start. And first of all, I want to remind you on the NAND side. We do have a headwind with the K1 startup costs and bringing up that fab and we are beginning production there. But there is probably in the neighborhood of 3.0 headwinds that we're faced with on the NAND side. And as we've ramped volume, then obviously the margins will improve everything else being equal.So in terms of a flash overall as we get to equilibrium between supply and demand, we're definitely expecting that the pricing will get better as we move through 20. Mike or Steve was saying. So I think it will take a little bit of time to work through that, but I think we're going to be a good price. Let me, because I get kind of this one I feel strongly about. We will -- we are intent is to have gross margins north of 30% for our hard drive business this quarter, the December quarter. And so there is no headwind at present, of course, there can be things that will happen. But there's nothing at present that indicates that we won't hit that level. Thank you. So a couple of things. Let me talk about the dynamics in the current period. We talked about. So when we look at where we started from all end markets in flash were not created equal relative to pricing and margin. We also noted that mobile was a inferior performing segment for us. We are taking more of that on this quarter, as a percentage of the total. So that is having a bit of a headwind, relative to the flash margin in the current quarter.To Steve's comments earlier on 2020 we see supply demand in pretty good shape as we come into 2020. But the normal seasonality of the year we got to make sure we're managing through that in a cautious way and we expect that is a year moves on. As we head towards the middle of the year in the back end that will continue to improve in the rate of margin improvement in flash will accelerate in the back half of the year. Well, we are, I mean, let me be clear on this we're not providing guidance beyond what we've done in terms of flash gross margins. But I'll tell you where we need to get to and where we want to get to is back to where flash gross margins are in that 40% range.That that's a margin level that we view as attainable over a period of time and it's also a margin level that we believe is required to get sufficient return on the capital that we are investing in this business. So that's where we want to head to. Now, let me, let me address the last question first. In terms of us growing and first off, the big growth that we're seeing from a demand of revenue perspective is consistent with previous expectations. It hasn't changed and by the way, one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that we took a meaningful amount of production offline starting earlier this year. Independent of the power outage because we saw the oversupply conditions well, we saw it coming.And we saw that situation being let's just call it untenable and so we were reducing our bit output from a supply perspective to help offset that growth that unnecessary growth from a supply perspective that created the substantial price decline that we in the industry realized in the back half of ' 18 and also into 2019. We have to start banning gross margin question. And yeah -- Bob already indicated that the K1 costs are kind of a 3-point drag and then if you neutralize for mix. I think that we would all be seeing a much more satisfying increase in our flash margins when you neutralize for those two items. And I think that's important for all of us to keep that in mind, the trajectory is in the right direction. It's just that there are other moving parts that tend to mask those improving trends. So we don't specifically disclose the ratio of flash participation. But I can give you some color on relative performance, certainly the areas a big investment for us that we emphasize our own where we want to grow our participation. So enterprise SSD fast growing higher overall margins than the average over time. Industrial embedded both similarly situation in the higher margins.Good growth rates and then ultimately certain segments of mobile over time are attractive and we're focused on those. Hence our UFS product investment, so the higher end higher performance part of that marketplace. So we put a big emphasis on quality of revenue and seeking out those higher margin more stable end markets and those will be examples that we're focused on. Yeah. So the reason that we made that decision and it's actually quite simple is that we, we made faster progress in terms of our 9 platter platform than what we had previously anticipated. And so the advancements that we were making from a mechanical perspective allowed us to pull in that platform sooner than what we anticipated, which was favorably received by our customers from a market place perspective, which I'll ask Mike to elaborate on. No, that's -- yeah that's total capacity enterprise. So hyperscale and OEM consumption of that class together. Yeah, I think the only thing we can say as we continue to see strength of the cycle. End of the first half of 20. I don't think we want to go any beyond that that supported in the 35% year over year growth parameters. So we don't see enrolling over yet. No. So it would point to sustainability end of the first half of the calendar year '20. Yeah. So I'll start with the K1 question. So right now I mean we're just beginning production in that fab and so it will be a gradual improvement in absorption over the next few quarters and eventually it will be fully absorbed and have a cost structure. Similar to what we experienced elsewhere. Well, I was going to respond to that. I'm sorry. But, so let me clarify. We have not exited from the mobile market, we chose not to participate in segments of that market for a period of time because the margins, it was not, it made and made no economic sense. Okay. As we see the pricing environment in that market. Begin to stabilize and improve consistent with improving supply and demand dynamics, we will be increasing our participation in that market starting this quarter. Well, I mean this selling a answer. It's the old adage that the best quarter of the year is October, November and December, it's around that time but I don't know, literally which month. So I think in general, our bit consumption of demand has been at or a well above what we thought. So our comments were we thought. By the end of the year the industry inventories would be substantially improved and we stand by that. I think we've seen generally speaking, some a little bit better mix in terms of capacity per unit. And I think some of the end markets are a little more robust than maybe we originally expected, including mobile."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve and good afternoon. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to congratulate Steve on his upcoming retirement. I value and appreciate the partnership we have built together over the past decade and want to acknowledge Steve for his leadership and numerous contributions to Western Digital.We have quite a bit of time and work to do between now and September of next year and look forward to working together to execute on our plans. As Steve mentioned, fiscal 2020 is off to a good start.We had record hard drive exabyte shipments driven by the success of our capacity enterprise drive family. We also had record exabyte shipments in the flash as we benefited from demand elasticity in share gains and SSDs for PCs and notebooks.In Data Center Devices and Solutions our capacity enterprise exabytes shipment growth was over 60% year-over-year, led by the ramp of our 14 terabyte drives. These drives now represent the majority of our capacity enterprise unit and exabyte shipments. Industry analysts expect the 14 terabyte capacity point to be the industry's highest volume product through the first half of calendar year 2020.Building on our aerial density leadership and execution on mechanical design, we announced our plan to accelerate the introduction of our 9 platter energy assisted capacity enterprise drive platform.This enables us to ship 16 and 18 terabyte CMR and 20 terabyte SMR drives on a unified platform, simplifying the qualification process and reducing the time to market for our customers.We will be sampling all of these drives by the end of this quarter and we will commence volume shipments in the first half of calendar 2020. In addition, we began shipping a new 10 terabyte air-based product powered by our innovative air flow architecture, underscoring our aerial density and mechanical design leadership.Given the strength of our capacity enterprise portfolio and the opportunities we see in this market. We now believe our exabyte shipment growth will exceed 40% in calendar year 2019, up from our prior estimate of 30%. In enterprise SSDs our NDME based products experienced a strong quarter of growth and we expect continued growth in the December quarter.We are qualifying our next generation 96 layer product with additional customers, which positions us for further market share gains in calendar year 2020 and beyond.We have a unique and sustainable competitive advantage within the data center built on strong customer relationships and a strong product portfolio. Our strategic position within this important end market will drive future revenue growth.In Client Solutions revenue grew on a sequential basis, driven by an improving pricing environment and a seasonal increase in bit shipments. This quarter we began shipping 96 layer QLC based retail products and external SSDs.The Trust and reputation of our brand and our customers preference for the performance and reliability of our solutions are key differentiators. In Client Devices the main contributor to our year-over-year decline was our decision to limit our participation in the mobile market.On a sequential basis, we expect to ship more bits into the mobile market in the December quarter. In PCs and notebooks, we gained market share and client SSDs as our exabytes shipment growth exceeded 70% year-over-year.Our bit production of 96 BiCS4 surpassed 64 BiCS3 during the September quarter. We are on track to commercialize BiCS4 across all our product lines by the end of calendar 2019. Our JV partner K1 fab and Western Digital executed well bringing the Yokkaichi fabs back to full production after the power outage limiting output reduction four exabytes.Our flash supply is tight and we continue to believe that any excess inventory in the flash industry supply chain will be substantially reduced by the end of calendar 2019. We expect flash industry supply bit growth to be in the mid 20% range in calendar 2019. And in the low 30% range in calendar 2020.In addition to continued growth in our existing flash portfolio and capacity enterprise markets, we see several new incremental growth opportunities. First, the launch of the next generation gaming consoles will be important events for the gaming industry and our flash business, we expect these new console to utilize high capacity flash storage to improve the gaming experience.Second, we expect to expand our product portfolio and diversify our customer base for the mobile market with our UFS, eMMC and custom solutions. Finally our recent announcements of 3D flash products for the automotive and industrial markets will further expand our opportunities in these growing and more stable flash-based markets.I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance. So Aaron, let me address that. So the primary reason for that is really the point that I made and Bob made in our comments is we did not participate in a substantial way in the mobile marketplace in the quarter just completed. So that's the primary driver of bit shipment in the quarter. So, Aaron I think for us, we actually updated our performance on the year. We originally had stated last quarter, we'd be north of 30% for us. We updated that guidance north of 40. We're actually seeing strength in exabyte consumption across the capacity enterprise segment.Now the other thing that's happening for us is more unique is the power of the 14 terabyte product is doing quite well. And obviously we are gaining market share in that segment that's showing up on an exabyte basis. Yeah, so let me just comment specifically capacity enterprise. We would expect for 2020, our current outlook is about 35% year-over-year growth. So continued strength year-over-year and so we don't split out total HDD exabyte growth, we don't specify them. Sure. You kind of pre-into my prepared question as by saying that you didn't participate in the mobile segment as it relates to your NAND shipment and there is a debate as to what happens to that inventory in the channel reserved mobiles segment, as you look into the March quarter.So with that as the background, how do you see the supply and demand in NAND looking into the March quarter and I'm not asking for a guide. I just want to better understand your view you didn't participate in the market and in that context, how do you see your prices trending into March quarter. Mehdi, I will just give you some numbers to work with there. We talked about low '30s on supply bit growth. We would expect demand for the calendar year to be slightly above that. Great. Thank you. And the other thing I would add, Marc is, if you look out over time we expect more and more growth in terms of capacity enterprise will become a bigger percentage of our overall mix and that will help the margins go up as well. So I ask Bob to address. So CJ in terms of the September quarter that we just finished the K1 costs were at $64 million and what I said in the guidance as we expect in the December quarter. That will be in the neighborhood of $75 million. We think they will start to come down from that point in time. But this is, I mean this is new production capacity we're putting in place, it becomes a part of our fixed cost over time. Okay. And back to the mix. Let me just reiterate within the flash business, we're taking on a greater proportion mobile business this quarter, which is a margin drag and is dampening our sequential margin performance, to some degree. On the flash side and then Bob also talked about the fact startup. So those two things are affecting the flash margin in this quarter.When we go into 2020 certainly a number of the new markets are good bit consumers the gaming business, we think that that is going to be not only a good consumer of bits but at reasonably attractive margins and industrial and automotive are even better yet relative to margins and more stable non-cyclical. Yeah. And I think a number of dimensions of this. Obviously, it gets them to 18 and 20 terabyte sooner than they would have otherwise. So the TCO benefit when you combine cost per bit with the other elements like slot tax because you know you eliminate some slots required and also the quality that we deliver with our products, the whole economic equation is better and then we talked about, we get a multi platform qualification.So for them their ability to qualify a single platform that covers all of those configurations is both a simplifying of their efforts on cost reduction of their efforts and it gets us to market earlier. So all positive trends from the customers' perspective and getting to that new 18 terabyte CMR in 20 terabyte SMR capacity earlier is a big value. Yeah, I think the other drivers are really looking at the individual segments. And as I talked about, we are continuing to expand the product portfolio and increased participation and let's call it higher quality revenue segments like enterprise SSD and other sort of high-end mobile marketplaces as we progress into 2020. So think of it is customer and product mix improvements as well. Yeah. So obviously we said we're sampling those in the current quarter and we expect to ramp that in the first half of calendar ' 20 so that's in the not too distant future."

Personally all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will open the lines up for questions shortly.  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for his introductory comments.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We reported solid fourth quarter results with revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.16, all above the guidance ranges we provided in April. The upside was primarily driven by record demand for our capacity enterprise hard drives. Fiscal year 2021 revenue totaled $16.9 billion and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $04.55. Last March I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company, and every person's day-to-day life. At that time, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Today the accelerated digital transformation that has occurred during this period has created a world that is more technology enabled and technology dependent than ever before. The increasing value and importance of data is undeniable and Western Digital will continue to capitalize on this opportunity as the only provider of both flash and hard drive solutions. Our ability to provide this diverse range of technologies enables us to drive innovation from endpoints to the edge to the cloud and combined with our commitment to delivering the highest quality products, is ultimately what sets us apart and allows us to deliver strong results. As we reflect on this fiscal year, I'm very proud of what Western Digital has accomplished, particularly in light of the fact that the pandemic impacted various aspects of our company and the supply chain. As a team we made the changes throughout the year necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution, and layout the right strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. To achieve these goals we created separate business units for our flash and HDD technologies, led by two widely respected technology leaders. As a result of this renewed focus, we accelerated our innovation roadmap, built momentum in our energy-assisted hard drives and continue to successfully ramp our second generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, while working hard to complete additional customer qualifications. We were also able to successfully navigate through the pandemic and capitalize on opportunities and continue providing dependable industry-leading products that are the cornerstones of the data economy. We continue to believe that we have the right foundation for success, the right market-leading products, the right customer base and the unique ability to address two large and growing markets. That foundation continues to underpin the strength of our results and is propelling the business forward today, even as we manage through some of the lingering impacts from COVID. And while we saw incremental demand due to the emergence of Chia, our standout performance this quarter was primarily attributable to increasing demand from our cloud customers and the beginning of a recovery in enterprise demand. The breadth and quality of our product line and our many routes to market, we feel we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll now provide a recap of our flash and HDD businesses as it relates to our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter demand for our flash products was greater than we could supply in a number of end markets. In the face of both component and NAND shortages, we continue to strategically shift bits to meet customer needs while driving growth in both revenue and gross margin. Within data center devices and solutions demand for our NVMe enterprise SSDs came in above our expectations, achieving strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, we are pleased with our progress in enterprise SSDs as we completed the qualification of another cloud Titan and are ramping the product more broadly. Within client SSD we experienced revenue growth as demand remained strong for notebooks and Chromebooks. This remains a large growing an important end market for Western Digital across our OEM channel and retail routes to market. Within gaming, demand from the latest generation of game consoles, and our WD Black product line was robust as gamers continued to prefer our expanding lineup of customized solutions. Within embedded flash, we also experienced growth in smart home devices, VR, automotive and industrial. As the BiCS5 ramp picks up and we achieve bit crossover late this year, we expect to see increased bit growth. To-date BiCS5 is our most capital efficient node in the 3D era and the ramp across our product lines will contribute to profitable growth. We have had incredible success with BiCS4 from across cost and bit growth perspective and look forward to experience those same benefits with BiCS5 highlighting once again the successful and important partnership we have with Kioxia. In HDD we had our highest organic sequential revenue growth in the last decade, driven by the successful ramp of our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drive, growing cloud demand, a recovery in enterprise spending, and to a lesser extent crypto currency driven by Chia. This impressive performance is a reflection of our data center customers confidence in our innovation engine for capacity enterprise hard drives. Shipments for our 18teribyte hard drive nearly tripled sequentially, highlighting our leadership in the latest capacity point and the leading edge energy-assist technology underpinning it. These drives are fully commercialized we expect the 18 terabyte hard drive to be the workhorse for the fiscal year. I'm excited to announce a record shipment of over 104 exabytes in capacity enterprise hard drives, a 49% increase sequentially. This is a significant achievement for the business as we have all of our largest customers qualified and are well into ramping our energy-assisted hard drives. In addition, client demand for desktop and smart video has been strong throughout the quarter due to improving OEM demand. While we are actively managing supply constraints, we expect strength in OEM to continue in the fiscal first quarter. Within retail HDD demand was above expectations as we saw consumer interest grow for both at home HDD storage and for smart video applications. There was also increased demand for hard drives due to Proof-of-space crypto currencies such as Chia, which emerged as a new vertical market at the beginning of the quarter. We believe Proof-of-space crypto currency presents a great opportunity for us in the industry, but we are closely monitoring the sustainability of demand. Looking ahead, we strongly believe the fundamental technology shift that I referenced earlier is a sustainable trend. At the center of this innovation are ever-increasing intelligent devices which are fueling exponential industry-wide growth in demand, all powered by the cloud. The ability to harness the data in both the device and in the data center is critical, highlighting the importance of our full range of storage solutions. Moreover, we believe we have the right portfolio to enable us to capture these opportunities. In particular, and as Dr. Siva Sivaram, President of Technology and Strategy discussed in a webcast on July 15, Western Digital's unique ability to deliver both HDD and flash solutions drives meaningful synergies across the business in four key areas; market, manufacturing, technology and customer. And our new operating structure gives us the focus we need to capture our full potential. While we remain optimistic, there are several factors we are closely monitoring. Most importantly, we are actively managing the continued impact of the pandemic. The disruptions to the supply chain have presented a challenge across the industry and we continue to see shortages of certain components. Additionally, logistics remain a challenge as different geographies are in various stages of reopening. This has been a major contributor to increase lead times and may pose challenges in the future. As a result of the supply disruptions, logistics challenges and increased lead times, we continue to face additional cost pressures. Despite these obstacles, we are working diligently to continue delivering to our customers while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing. I'll now turn the call over to Bob, to share details on our financial results.\nRobert Eulau: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in April. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up 19% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.16. For the full fiscal year revenue was $16.9 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2020 and non-GAAP EPS was $4.55, up 50% from last year. Looking at our end markets, Client Devices revenue was $2.2 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we experienced revenue growth in both hard drives and flash and across every major product category; client HDDs, client SSDs, automotive, gaming, smart video and industrial. Mobile revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 44% sequentially and up 6% from a year ago. New product ramps in this end market drove more than double the revenue growth from just two quarters ago. Revenue generated from our latest generation energy-assisted hard drives and enterprises SSDs contributed to the growth. Our capacity enterprise hard drives grew 49% sequentially and our enterprise SSDs grew 39% sequentially. Demand for our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drives was particularly strong, comprising nearly half of our capacity enterprise exabytes shipments. Finally, Client Solutions revenue was $977 million, up 10% sequentially and up 42% from a year ago. Once again revenue growth was broad based across both HDD and flash and all major product categories. Turning to revenue by technology, flash revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 7% sequentially on a blended basis and up 4% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 4% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 34%, while the average price per hard drive increased 18% to $97. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up 5.2 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in April. Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively ship bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our gross margin by 5.5 percentage points sequentially to 35.5%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.3% up 5.3 percentage points sequentially. This also includes a COVID-related impact of $32 million or approximately $1.3 percentage points. Operating expenses were $790 million within our guidance range. Operating income was $828 million representing 101% increase from the prior quarter and a 57% increase year-over-year. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was 9.2% and the tax rate was 13.4% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $2.16. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $994 million and free cash flow was $792 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was an outflow of $202 million. We expect growth CapEx for the next fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion. In the fiscal fourth quarter we paid off $212 million in debt, including a discretionary debt payment of $150 million. For the full fiscal year we paid down a total of $886 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.8 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. Additionally, we have already made a discretionary debt payment of $150 million in the fiscal first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement was $3.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.4 times compared to 2.8 a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the investor relations website for further details. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have unused revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Moving on to our outlook, our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows; we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 33% and 35%. We expect hard drive gross margin to be relatively flat and we expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially. We expect operating expenses to be between $755 million and $785 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 12% in the fiscal first quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to between $2.25 and $2.55 in the first quarter assuming approximately $317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Dave.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks Bob. As we close out fiscal year 2021, I am very pleased with how the Western Digital team successfully navigated dynamic market conditions brought on by the pandemic. While it has been a challenging time for all, we will continue to focus on driving innovation. When you combine the ramp of new innovation products into two very large and growing markets with our newly adapted organization structure, I am confident that our increased focus on execution will continue to propel us forward as the market leaders. Our diverse technology portfolio is the foundation of the data economy and our unique ability to see the entire storage market enables us to move across the technology landscape to meet customers' needs and be the solution for their evolving storage challenges. With careful consideration of the health and safety of our employees, we are also keeping a close eye on the status of COVID-19. In particular, there are certain parts of Asia seeing a spike in cases and we are working diligently to support our employees through this time. While it is a difficult situation, we will continue to navigate the complexities presented by the pandemic while we drive innovation for customers and value for shareholders. Let\u2019s begin the Q&A session.\nOperator:  We have a question from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the tightness in NAND that you referenced, to what degree is that a NAND issue versus controllers and kind of other components trickle  into NAND products?\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey Joe, good to hear from you. So, it's both. There\u2019s no doubt there is shortage in controllers and I think what we are doing is mixing the portfolio to get the most out of the controllers we have, also a shortage of NAND as well. So I mean, we're mixing to get the best result we can, but there\u2019s more demand than we are able to satisfy on the NAND side. So, it\u2019s really, we are juggling both and balancing them to get the best result we can.\nJoseph Moore: Okay and as, you guide for the September quarter is the assumption that you\u2019re still kind of supply constrained for the whole quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we are still juggling both of those things. Right? We have customers looking for upside, we are juggling that. Mixes is a little different from quarter to quarter as well. So yes, when you roll all that together is how you to get -- get to where we are at in Q1.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you very much.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure thing.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations from the solid results. I want to ask about the hard disc drives, the 49% sequential growth in your year line capacity shift and I\u2019m curious that, how are you thinking about the sustainability of that demand? I think last quarter you talked a little bit about longer term purchase agreement, and then if you can underneath of that also any thoughts of how significant Chia was as far as a contribution this last quarter? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, thanks, Aaron. So we did see very, very strong demand from the cloud and I think the product has been very well received. As we've talked about energy-assist is fully commercialized now. We saw very strong sequential growth of the AT&T product. We continue to see strong growth in the second half, working with our customers. We expect continued growth in the business. The long-term agreements, I think we're, I think, probably the best way to think about that as we're working through the first cohort of those and we expect to talk about the second cohort in the second half, and they're becoming more and more important, because getting visibility and the demand is very important, especially going forward is where we're thinking about how to invest in additional head capacity to support the growth of the business, just the exabyte growth. Chia was, maybe one way to think about that, it was hitting us kind of right where we were on the call was, I think the first week of it last quarter, probably a couple $100 million of upside there in the quarter due to Chia.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I'm having a hard time reconciling the strong demand trends outlined here on the call with revenues only guided up 2% sequentially. So can you walk through, I guess, where you're seeing supply constraints both HDD and NAND? And are you seeing one more so than the other? And then perhaps to help us understand your, I presumed improving visibility, did your backlog grow sequentially into the June quarter and do you expect it to grow again exiting September? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, so it was an exceptional quarter on growth and there is tightness across both portfolios, there's no doubt about that. We were pushing the factories very, very hard to get every drive we could out of it, because there was demand for it. So when you look at it sequentially, we had a strong quarter and we were basically able to find sales for everything that we could produce. And, so going, so when you look at sequential growth, I guess it's not surprising that there's not a huge amount of top line growth there. But throughout the markets, we continue to, so hard drives we see strength in the cloud. We're seeing really good strength in kind of mid cap as well. It's not just at the top of the market. But on the flat side, again, we've got more customers looking for upside than we do the opposite. So the demand environment is good and we're doing the best we can to satisfy as much as they can with the components we have and with the NAND available.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the very strong results. I had a question on NAND. I think costs in the quarter were up a little bit on a sequential basis. I realize cost downs on a quarterly basis can be very lumpy, and you're coming off a multi quarter stretch of very strong cost downs, but curious what you saw in the quarter from a cost perspective in NAND. And I think in your prepared remarks, Dave, you talked about, your expectations for BiCS4, BiCS5 I'm sorry, being similar to the BiCS4 the ramp, BiCS5 over the next 12 months. If you can kind of set expectations and how we should think about cost downs as you make that transition that will be super helpful? Thank you.\nRobert Eulau: Hey, Toshiya, it's Bob. So in terms of the cost takedowns, we actually looked at it mostly year-over-year, and we were a little bit ahead of the 15% goal we have for year-over-year cost declines and continue to feel good about 15% as the long-term goal. We are starting the nodal transition. We did this past quarter to BiCS5 and we'll continue to ramp that hard through the second half. As Dave mentioned, we expect to get the crossover in the fourth calendar quarter. So I think in terms of costs, I think we're in a good place.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. I know forecasting ASPS is difficult, but your implied outlook seems to suggest a decline in hard drive pricing, similar with what you saw last year. And I was wondering, should we assume that your assumption for hard drive gross margins is driven by less favorable mix of retail draws? And as you address that question, could you discuss the mix of long-term agreements you have in place today for nearline drives, and whether those are negotiated both on price and volume or just volume? Thank you.\nRobert Eulau: Hi, Karl, it's Bob. I'll start and then Dave can add in. But in terms of the guide on hard drives, we aren't actually guiding specifically by segment. We had really good gross margins on hard drives this quarter above 30% and we're expecting our gross margins to be above 30%, again in Q1 so we feel good about that. And, as we've said, we really want to continue to improve from here. We're going to be very judicious in terms of how we add capacity, because we want to continue to improve our margins over time.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Karl and the long term agreements, we kind of think about those as setting a baseline for volume and price. It doesn't mean that's going to be everything that goes into a certain customer, but it sets a baseline and gives us some visibility over multiple quarters. Like I said, we're kind of working our way through the first cohort of those, and we'll be looking at the second ones in the second half of the year. As I said, I do think they're becoming more important to give us the visibility we need on demand to make sure we make the right investments to support the exabyte growth.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nPeter Andrew: Hilda, can we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question, and the first one is for David. Over the past few quarters, you have exceeded your guide by 40%, 50% and I understand there is the supply chain disruption and you want to be prudent. But there's perhaps, there is also some level of conservatism that goes into your guide. And then for Bob, I understand exabyte shipment is improving to September quarter, but I do understand is why is gross margin guidance flattish? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I mean, there's always some natural conservatism, I think in anything we do. But we also, you know, there's a fair amount of leverage in the model in this quarter we saw when we overachieved on the top line and we get benefit from the tax rate. So and we also had a better pricing environment on drives than we expected, which is, which was great. We took advantage of it. I think we had a market situation that was very, very dynamic. And the team really did a good job of managing through that and getting the most out of that we possibly could. So it was a very dynamic quarter. And also, we're still managing through COVID, which is, there's still a lot of supply chain issues we're working through. I mean, we've been working through these for a long time now and we're very good at managing that. But there is still some risk out there because of that. And so we want to be prudent around the whole business, but we feel good about where we're at. We're very happy with the quarter. Like I said, I think we got the most out of a good situation and really, really driven by strong demand on the cloud and bringing innovation to market. I mean, I think that's the way I think about this. We brought energy-assist to market. We've been talking about it for many quarters now. We've been giving a lot of visibility into the -- to the qualification process, because it is new technology that's been worked on for a very, very long time. And I think our customers are responding very strongly to that and we saw that in the results and the sequential capacity enterprise, exabyte shipments of 49% to really a record level. So we feel really good about where the portfolio is at and customers are really responding to it.\nRobert Eulau: So Mehdi, on gross margin, I mean, first of all, we're really pleased with the 5.2 percentage point increase we had in gross margin going from Q3 to Q4. And if you look at the guidance for Q1, it's a range of 33% to 35%. So it's at the midpoint, we're still expecting to see improving gross margin. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we're expecting hard drive gross margin to be above 30% again and in terms of the flash side, it will obviously improve, but the mix is different each quarter. And we're going to improve our gross margins and probably don't have quite as healthy a mix, as we had in Q4. But again, still feel really good about the guidance range and I think it will deliver very good margin and very good profitability.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you, and congrats on the really strong results. I was hoping maybe I'm sorry, if I missed this, but can you help handicap the magnitude of impact to top line and margins from the ongoing supply chain issues and the best way that possible? And also for the guide, is there a way to handicap that and Dave, you mentioned the couple of $100 million benefit in the quarter from Chia. I was wondering, do you think that that sustains at some level, as you look into your guide do you have any expectation baked in the guide as well? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: That sustains from Chia. I think we're -- Chia had a big impact on the channel and inventory and it's going to take a little while for that all to normalize. So I think you have a lingering impact there. We're certainly watching overall demand, but it's tapered off from where it was, let's say mid quarter. But clearly a space we're watching. We're watching very closely. I'll ask Bob to comment as well. So it is a little hard to handicap what you're -- I think you're asking, which is how much upside is there if we had all the components we could possibly get? I do think what we do is, with what we have, we change the mix in the portfolio to get the best we can and put the product at the best route to market, whether it's in the channel or somewhere or into retail or somewhere else where we can get the best return for that particular component. But I don't know, Bob do you have any way, not to put you on the spot, but feel free to handicap that from a numbers perspective?\nRobert Eulau: No, it's really hard to say. I mean, as Dave said, I mean, particularly on that channel side, we shift a lot during the quarter. So our inventory levels are low there. If you really forced us to guess on the fourth quarter, maybe we missed out on $50 million to $100 million in revenue. But it's very hard to quantify what we would have been able to do had we had all the controllers that we wanted. And as we look at Q1, I mean, we're expecting to be able to manage through the supply chain challenges like we have for the last few quarters. And I don't really know, it's hard to quantify before we even get into the quarter what the supply issues may be, but we're going to we're going to work and it'll be a very dynamic environment and we feel good about the revenue guidance we gave.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, guys, if I could just quickly follow up. I was wondering just on the margin impact on the guide. Right? So clearly, there are a lot of moving pieces over here, but if you were to think about what impact COVID, Delta variant and some of the things that are happening in Asia, like how are you handicapping that in your margin impact on the guide? Thank you.\nRobert Eulau: Well, certainly on the hard drive side, I'm expecting we're going to have the same logistics challenges we've had for the last year or so. So you're going to have something in the neighborhood of 1.2, 1.3 percentage points of headwind on the hard drive side. And we have to continue to work through the COVID situation from a factory perspective and supply chain perspective. And as Dave said, we've been doing it for a lot of quarters now, but the situation is not good in Asia and we need to really, really make sure we're careful in terms of how we work through that.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Thank you very much. With NAND pricing going higher spot and contract and such, can you talk to us a little bit about your leverage or flow through the operating margins, because I believe your costs should keep coming lower. Shipping costs, while high it's hard to see them getting worse in the next few months ahead. So may be if you can walk us through the model and normally you have annual price declines with ASPs going higher. Is there more investments needed or more fixit things or talk to us about the flow through or what we consider operating margin leverage.\nDavid Goeckeler: We have a lot of operating leverage in our model and I think you saw that come into play this quarter. I mean, I think it was a really impressive improvement in terms of gross margin sequentially and a lot of what we saw on the pricing side did flow through. I mean, as we said, we saw a lot of demand on the channel driven by Chia in most cases, but across the board, we saw a good environment. And I think the team did a good job of reacting dynamically and trying to properly price the products as we went through the quarter. So we're going to continue to do that same kind of thing as we move forward and we are going to see cost takedowns. We had very good cost takedowns in Q4 on both the hard drive side and on the flash side, and as we keep price flat or even increase price, then that's obviously going to only help in terms of operating leverage.\nJames Suva: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much. Dave, in terms of the activity you're doing with cloud and hyperscale and the pickup you're seeing there, can you talk about any qualitatively new customer wins whether it's cloud, hyperscale or data centers with the new 18-terabyte drives? Can you please qualitatively talk about the adoption rate and whether you're seeing greater adoption from existing customers who are transitioning or even new customers that weren't previously on your mass capacity storage drives?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, at this point I think it's where they're at in the architectural evolution of their data center of how they're adopting the technology as far as qualification. So first of all, I mean, if you're building a cloud, you're most likely our customer. Hard drives are the lion's share of storage in the cloud. But we're seeing wide adoption, I guess, is the only way I can say it. I mean, it's our customers, different customers, will be at different part, different stages of their architectural evolution, some are going to 18 as fast as they can. Some are working through a 14 transition, let's say in the second half of the year, and then will move to 18. Some are going through 16. So at this point it is just a question of how they're all transitioning their data centers. Again, we saw really strong growth throughout the quarter and as Bob said, it's nearly half of our exabyte ship capacity, enterprise exabyte shipments were on 18. So we feel really good about where the product is and like I said, the innovation of energy-assist has been fully commercialized and has been well received by our customers.\nPatrick Ho: Great, thank you very much.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure thing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In addition to the SSD controller shortages, we've heard of tight HDD controller and preamp chip supply as your ASIC semiconductor partners are pretty constrained and lead times are pretty stretched. And so, if the team had more HDD controller and preamp supply, would you be able to ship more HDDs here in the September quarter or is more of the HDD shipment constraints in September being driven by other component constraints or media and head manufacturing or just potential pandemic related operations disruptions.\nRobert Eulau: Harlan, it is Bob. We're basically running at full capacity in the September quarter on the hard drive side, so it's not easy to get the parts and that's definitely true. But in the September quarter, I don't see it as a big factor. We'll see how that plays out as we get to the December quarter and beyond.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Harlan, I was going to say same thing. I mean, we've got folks in the factories working overtime and to get every drive we can out I mean the team is obviously balancing the supply chain issues to get all the components we need, but we've got that covered in September. And so keeping again we're -- these are in places where COVID is a big deal and we've been really good about managing through that, but something got our eye on, but we're really pushing very hard to get all the components we can all the drives, we can.\nHarlan Sur: I appreciate the insights. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure thing.\nRobert Eulau: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays.\nThomas O'Malley: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle about a comment you made earlier, you said that Chia had a big impact on the channel. I'm looking at inventory. Inventory days are flat on a dollars basis, down on a days basis. Can you kind of comment on the mix of inventory? I would assume with some of the HDD activity you saw during the quarter the channel has kind of been wound down a bit. Is there any color you can give on the mix of businesses within the inventory that you have this quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, in terms of our inventory and the turns around quite a bit on the hard drive side and I'd say relatively flat, maybe even slightly worse on the flash side and that see you all going through a nodal transition, it's not a big surprise there. So and the flow-through as you saw was up significantly during the quarter.\nThomas O'Malley: Thanks, Guys.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Great, thanks for taking my question. My question is on capital intensity. Can you talk about gross CapEx for fiscal 22 being $3.1 billion and that would be roughly 15% of fiscal first quarter revenue run rate. Is that the right capital intensity we should be thinking about, maybe you can comment on both HDD and NAND, that would be great? And what kind of assumptions are you expecting in terms of bit growth coming out of the main financial things? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes so a few questions in there. So first of all in terms of CapEx we exited FY 2021 around $3 billion in growth CapEx and that's what we're expecting again in FY 2022. We are well on our way in terms of the ramp on BiCS5 and in terms of the capital investment, and we will have to obviously continue to invest in both businesses. We've got two growing businesses and they are going to require capital going forward. On the hard drive side, we're at the point where we can no longer transition the assets from the client side of the business to the capacity enterprise business. And so that means we have to be pretty cautious in terms of investments we make. That's part of why we've done some of these long term agreements and we're going to continue to be very careful in terms of capacity we've put in place. And on the flash side, the goal as we've been saying is to really grow bits at the rate that the market is growing and we think over the long-term we will be able to do that.\nSidney Ho: Okay, thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I had maybe a bigger picture question. I'm just wondering how you are thinking about the inflationary environment? Are you hearing from many customers that there's some pushback because of less demand given price increases? And then just internally, how are you thinking about managing higher cost and not necessarily next quarter, but just in general as we face more inflation? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, it's a good question Shannon. And we are definitely facing inflationary pressures across the board and we've talked about the semiconductor components already on this call, and we're seeing lead times extend out. We're seeing challenges on the cost side as well. And we're going to -- we think we're going to face that across a number of different commodities. And also the discussion we need to have with our customers as well, and I think most of them are also facing inflationary pressures. So it's not something that you can work out in a single quarter, but I think over time we've got to make sure we're getting obviously an adequate return on investments we're making from a CapEx standpoint and the costs that we have in each of the products.\nShannon Cross: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Todorov from Longbow Research.\nNikolay Todorov: Yes, good afternoon guys and congrats on great results from me as well.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nNikolay Todorov: Dave, I think, can you hear me?\nDavid Goeckeler: Oh yes, please go ahead.\nNikolay Todorov: Yes, yes, you talked about more customers looking for upside on the NAND side in the September quarter and it sounds like you are pretty constrained. But if I look at your guide it implies at best a modest low single digit NAND ASP increase. I wonder why you are not able to get better pricing leverage on the NAND? I think you talked about mix changing in the September quarter, if that's the big driver can you please give us more detail, how do you see the mix shifting on the NAND? Is there any lumpiness in the enterprise as the mix in the September quarter? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, no, I think you got it. I mean, again we're running a portfolio across the four or five major pillars; enterprises, SSD, mobile, consumer and anchor the portfolio client SSD and then of course positions in gaming, IoT, automotive, but every quarter the mix is going to be different across that. And obviously the pricing is changing as different rates across those markets. We're clearly trying to shift as much as we can into the higher margin markets, but every quarter the mix is going to be a little bit different. And depending on what our commitments are, we have commitments to customers as to how much we're going to supply in any given quarter. So when you put that all together, the mix is a little different in Q1, and I think that's where you've got some of the difference coming from in the way you're thinking about it.\nNikolay Todorov: Got it, thanks. Good luck, guys.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, thanks for taking the questions guys and congrats on the strong results. I guess it's really -- the question really is around the margins and structural margins on both sides of the business. Do you think over time structurally the margins can move higher from here, and what would be sort of the pushes and pulls or sort of the dynamics, like what would things have to look like, would have to get done on both sides of the business for that to happen and kind of structurally higher, meaningfully, nice, nicely and structurally higher? Thanks a lot.\nDavid Goeckeler: So I think the answer to that is, I don\u2019t think the answer to that is yes. Let's go through each business. On the drive side we saw a big step up this quarter driven by a number of things. We've been talking about the 18-terabyte capacity point is much better for us for a number of quarters now and we saw that play out. We obviously got some benefit from Chi as well, but predominantly innovation led story from my perspective, but we believe this business inside our company needs to be more profitable. We've talked about it several times on this call. We're now looking at this transition from client capacity to capacity enterprise, nearliner enterprise drives that is -- that era is coming to an end. It's been a long one. It's been -- it's taken a decade to go through that transition, but when we look at the exabyte growth going forward that's going to take investment and we want that investment to be fully justified. So and again it's no surprise to me that now we're talking about these more longer-term agreements and again were early days in those, but those are the conversations with customers. I remember when I came in this business, whatever five quarters ago, everything was transacted on a quarterly or even within the quarter basis and now we're moving to -- in parts of the business multi-quarter basis and I think that will continue because we need more visibility into demand to make sure we can continue to fuel the growth of the cloud. I think the cloud is incredible technology. The seminal technology of our era as I talk -- as I like to say and continuing to fuel the growth there is very important and 35% exabyte growth is going to take investments and I think that's going to take, we're going to want to see the internals of our business be able to support that. And on the flash side we're going to, just one financial comment on that. We're also continuing to innovate in hard drives and drive cost down as well. I think we think about cost down is more in the flash business, but we also continue to drive in the drive business, so we have that dynamic working as well. And on flash, we all know about how dynamic the pricing environment is. We feel very good about our technology roadmap, we've talked about that. We're at the transition point to BiCS5. We feel good about that node as we transition to that over the next couple of quarters. We will see our bit growth accelerate and that that foundational investment with Kioxia I think puts us in a very good position to have the technology roadmap, just structurally support margins in the business. Yes, clearly a better pricing environment as we're seeing helps margins in that business. We expect it to be better next quarter, that's the way we're guiding. And as we looked even beyond the second half and we look into next year, we continue to see a strong demand environment that's getting out there pretty far, but from what our customers are telling us telling us of what they think the demand is going to be for their products. Like I said we are more technology dependent than ever. We continue to hear good things about what they're going be asking for next year. So structurally we think with the technology, with the innovation we're driving in both portfolios, that puts us in a good position to continue to drive profitability in these businesses.\nAnanda Baruah: That's helpful. Yes, thanks a lot, I appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko Securities America\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. David, on the enterprise SSD front, I think you said it grew 39% quarter-on-quarter, obviously very strong quarter. Just curious if it's driven primarily by end demand and if there were new customer ramps as well? And also if you could talk about if there was any contribution from Chia on the SSD side as well? I think will be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, the first one just quickly, very minimal contribution from Chia in the enterprise SSD market. Yes, we are happy with the sequential growth of the products, and we did complete a qualification at another cloud Titan, which is something we've had eyes on for a while and we've talked about. We haven't started ramping there yet, but we'll see that in the second half of the year. We also saw good demand in the channel on enterprise SSD. So we qualified with one of the very big players and we see continued growth there. We're seeing good acceptance in the channel and growth there and now we're layering in additional major customers as we go into the second half of the year. So we feel good about how the product is being accepted again. Lot of innovation in our products. We've being talking about that for many quarters, again giving visibility to the qualification process, and now we're well into the ramp and feel good about where we're at and where it's going and how it's being accepted by our customers.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thanks David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller from The Benchmark Company.\nMark Miller: Just was wondering the SSD space, do you feel you are picking up share?\nDavid Goeckeler: I suspect we're picking up share as we grow, so I don\u2019t think the market grew sequentially 39%. Again, we're focused on profitable share gains, but this has been a focus for us to get that product introduced. It's a very attractive market and get it qualified in as many places as we can. But we're going to continue driving for growth quarter over quarter.\nMark Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.\nTristan Gerra: Hi good afternoon. You've given some puts and takes about gross margin criteria for hard disk drive. How should we look at the potential for gross margin longer term? You have mentioned you are already at full capacity. Can you go higher given new customer mix and given the purchasing power that some of your large data center customers have without cover to expenses is a longer term 35% in your outlook possible and if you could just provide a bit more color on what you think are the catalysts going forward?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I mean as we -- I think as we've talked about, we're in this period in the hard drive business where it's been transitioning for a long time from a business that was client dominated to a business that is cloud dominated is I guess one way to think about it. And if we look at the utilization of our factories, you can see that very clearly, year-over-year the percentage of drives there were headed for the cloud versus the ones that are headed for clients has been steadily shifting over a decade and now we're at the point where we're looking at investments both in  and also when you build a bigger driver it takes longer to test, all those kinds of things, testing, capacity in the factory. So yes, as we go through those conversations, it's really important to understand from our customers what their growth is going to be. We see 30% to 35% exabyte growth in the cloud for the foreseeable future. We want to make sure that they see that same amount. And as we align on that growth and we invest in our business to support it, I think that's where this idea of long-term agreements come in place and to help drive the profitability for the business. We think the innovation is delivering, I mean it starts with delivering a product that is very, solves the customers problem and we're delivering a very strong TCO model with every generation of this product that we build. We're driving a lot of innovation. You know we talked about it here with energy-assist which is something that we've been working on for quite some time. And quite frankly it's a good accomplishment for the team, a great accomplishment. It feels good to take something that was an idea many, many years ago, and now turn it into something where the largest customers in the world are betting their business and their data center on that innovation. And so to continue to fuel that innovation engine we've got we got many, many innovations lined up to continue to drive the portfolio and making sure we can invest in that and meet the growth of our customers. Getting the economics of that right is very important.\nTristan Gerra: Great, thanks for the additional color.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure, thanks. Thank you. All right everybody thanks for your time today. We really appreciate it. We will be seeing you throughout the quarter. Thanks very much.\nRobert Eulau: Yes, thanks everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We reported solid fourth quarter results with revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.16, all above the guidance ranges we provided in April. The upside was primarily driven by record demand for our capacity enterprise hard drives. Fiscal year 2021 revenue totaled $16.9 billion and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $04.55. Last March I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company, and every person's day-to-day life. At that time, we were in the early stages of the pandemic. Today the accelerated digital transformation that has occurred during this period has created a world that is more technology enabled and technology dependent than ever before. The increasing value and importance of data is undeniable and Western Digital will continue to capitalize on this opportunity as the only provider of both flash and hard drive solutions. Our ability to provide this diverse range of technologies enables us to drive innovation from endpoints to the edge to the cloud and combined with our commitment to delivering the highest quality products, is ultimately what sets us apart and allows us to deliver strong results. As we reflect on this fiscal year, I'm very proud of what Western Digital has accomplished, particularly in light of the fact that the pandemic impacted various aspects of our company and the supply chain. As a team we made the changes throughout the year necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution, and layout the right strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. To achieve these goals we created separate business units for our flash and HDD technologies, led by two widely respected technology leaders. As a result of this renewed focus, we accelerated our innovation roadmap, built momentum in our energy-assisted hard drives and continue to successfully ramp our second generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, while working hard to complete additional customer qualifications. We were also able to successfully navigate through the pandemic and capitalize on opportunities and continue providing dependable industry-leading products that are the cornerstones of the data economy. We continue to believe that we have the right foundation for success, the right market-leading products, the right customer base and the unique ability to address two large and growing markets. That foundation continues to underpin the strength of our results and is propelling the business forward today, even as we manage through some of the lingering impacts from COVID. And while we saw incremental demand due to the emergence of Chia, our standout performance this quarter was primarily attributable to increasing demand from our cloud customers and the beginning of a recovery in enterprise demand. The breadth and quality of our product line and our many routes to market, we feel we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll now provide a recap of our flash and HDD businesses as it relates to our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter demand for our flash products was greater than we could supply in a number of end markets. In the face of both component and NAND shortages, we continue to strategically shift bits to meet customer needs while driving growth in both revenue and gross margin. Within data center devices and solutions demand for our NVMe enterprise SSDs came in above our expectations, achieving strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, we are pleased with our progress in enterprise SSDs as we completed the qualification of another cloud Titan and are ramping the product more broadly. Within client SSD we experienced revenue growth as demand remained strong for notebooks and Chromebooks. This remains a large growing an important end market for Western Digital across our OEM channel and retail routes to market. Within gaming, demand from the latest generation of game consoles, and our WD Black product line was robust as gamers continued to prefer our expanding lineup of customized solutions. Within embedded flash, we also experienced growth in smart home devices, VR, automotive and industrial. As the BiCS5 ramp picks up and we achieve bit crossover late this year, we expect to see increased bit growth. To-date BiCS5 is our most capital efficient node in the 3D era and the ramp across our product lines will contribute to profitable growth. We have had incredible success with BiCS4 from across cost and bit growth perspective and look forward to experience those same benefits with BiCS5 highlighting once again the successful and important partnership we have with Kioxia. In HDD we had our highest organic sequential revenue growth in the last decade, driven by the successful ramp of our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drive, growing cloud demand, a recovery in enterprise spending, and to a lesser extent crypto currency driven by Chia. This impressive performance is a reflection of our data center customers confidence in our innovation engine for capacity enterprise hard drives. Shipments for our 18teribyte hard drive nearly tripled sequentially, highlighting our leadership in the latest capacity point and the leading edge energy-assist technology underpinning it. These drives are fully commercialized we expect the 18 terabyte hard drive to be the workhorse for the fiscal year. I'm excited to announce a record shipment of over 104 exabytes in capacity enterprise hard drives, a 49% increase sequentially. This is a significant achievement for the business as we have all of our largest customers qualified and are well into ramping our energy-assisted hard drives. In addition, client demand for desktop and smart video has been strong throughout the quarter due to improving OEM demand. While we are actively managing supply constraints, we expect strength in OEM to continue in the fiscal first quarter. Within retail HDD demand was above expectations as we saw consumer interest grow for both at home HDD storage and for smart video applications. There was also increased demand for hard drives due to Proof-of-space crypto currencies such as Chia, which emerged as a new vertical market at the beginning of the quarter. We believe Proof-of-space crypto currency presents a great opportunity for us in the industry, but we are closely monitoring the sustainability of demand. Looking ahead, we strongly believe the fundamental technology shift that I referenced earlier is a sustainable trend. At the center of this innovation are ever-increasing intelligent devices which are fueling exponential industry-wide growth in demand, all powered by the cloud. The ability to harness the data in both the device and in the data center is critical, highlighting the importance of our full range of storage solutions. Moreover, we believe we have the right portfolio to enable us to capture these opportunities. In particular, and as Dr. Siva Sivaram, President of Technology and Strategy discussed in a webcast on July 15, Western Digital's unique ability to deliver both HDD and flash solutions drives meaningful synergies across the business in four key areas; market, manufacturing, technology and customer. And our new operating structure gives us the focus we need to capture our full potential. While we remain optimistic, there are several factors we are closely monitoring. Most importantly, we are actively managing the continued impact of the pandemic. The disruptions to the supply chain have presented a challenge across the industry and we continue to see shortages of certain components. Additionally, logistics remain a challenge as different geographies are in various stages of reopening. This has been a major contributor to increase lead times and may pose challenges in the future. As a result of the supply disruptions, logistics challenges and increased lead times, we continue to face additional cost pressures. Despite these obstacles, we are working diligently to continue delivering to our customers while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing. I'll now turn the call over to Bob, to share details on our financial results. Thanks Bob. As we close out fiscal year 2021, I am very pleased with how the Western Digital team successfully navigated dynamic market conditions brought on by the pandemic. While it has been a challenging time for all, we will continue to focus on driving innovation. When you combine the ramp of new innovation products into two very large and growing markets with our newly adapted organization structure, I am confident that our increased focus on execution will continue to propel us forward as the market leaders. Our diverse technology portfolio is the foundation of the data economy and our unique ability to see the entire storage market enables us to move across the technology landscape to meet customers' needs and be the solution for their evolving storage challenges. With careful consideration of the health and safety of our employees, we are also keeping a close eye on the status of COVID-19. In particular, there are certain parts of Asia seeing a spike in cases and we are working diligently to support our employees through this time. While it is a difficult situation, we will continue to navigate the complexities presented by the pandemic while we drive innovation for customers and value for shareholders. Let's begin the Q&A session. Hey Joe, good to hear from you. So, it's both. There's no doubt there is shortage in controllers and I think what we are doing is mixing the portfolio to get the most out of the controllers we have, also a shortage of NAND as well. So I mean, we're mixing to get the best result we can, but there's more demand than we are able to satisfy on the NAND side. So, it's really, we are juggling both and balancing them to get the best result we can. Yes, we are still juggling both of those things. Right? We have customers looking for upside, we are juggling that. Mixes is a little different from quarter to quarter as well. So yes, when you roll all that together is how you to get -- get to where we are at in Q1. Sure thing. Yes, thanks, Aaron. So we did see very, very strong demand from the cloud and I think the product has been very well received. As we've talked about energy-assist is fully commercialized now. We saw very strong sequential growth of the AT&T product. We continue to see strong growth in the second half, working with our customers. We expect continued growth in the business. The long-term agreements, I think we're, I think, probably the best way to think about that as we're working through the first cohort of those and we expect to talk about the second cohort in the second half, and they're becoming more and more important, because getting visibility and the demand is very important, especially going forward is where we're thinking about how to invest in additional head capacity to support the growth of the business, just the exabyte growth. Chia was, maybe one way to think about that, it was hitting us kind of right where we were on the call was, I think the first week of it last quarter, probably a couple $100 million of upside there in the quarter due to Chia. Yes, so it was an exceptional quarter on growth and there is tightness across both portfolios, there's no doubt about that. We were pushing the factories very, very hard to get every drive we could out of it, because there was demand for it. So when you look at it sequentially, we had a strong quarter and we were basically able to find sales for everything that we could produce. And, so going, so when you look at sequential growth, I guess it's not surprising that there's not a huge amount of top line growth there. But throughout the markets, we continue to, so hard drives we see strength in the cloud. We're seeing really good strength in kind of mid cap as well. It's not just at the top of the market. But on the flat side, again, we've got more customers looking for upside than we do the opposite. So the demand environment is good and we're doing the best we can to satisfy as much as they can with the components we have and with the NAND available. Yes, Karl and the long term agreements, we kind of think about those as setting a baseline for volume and price. It doesn't mean that's going to be everything that goes into a certain customer, but it sets a baseline and gives us some visibility over multiple quarters. Like I said, we're kind of working our way through the first cohort of those, and we'll be looking at the second ones in the second half of the year. As I said, I do think they're becoming more important to give us the visibility we need on demand to make sure we make the right investments to support the exabyte growth. Yes, I mean, there's always some natural conservatism, I think in anything we do. But we also, you know, there's a fair amount of leverage in the model in this quarter we saw when we overachieved on the top line and we get benefit from the tax rate. So and we also had a better pricing environment on drives than we expected, which is, which was great. We took advantage of it. I think we had a market situation that was very, very dynamic. And the team really did a good job of managing through that and getting the most out of that we possibly could. So it was a very dynamic quarter. And also, we're still managing through COVID, which is, there's still a lot of supply chain issues we're working through. I mean, we've been working through these for a long time now and we're very good at managing that. But there is still some risk out there because of that. And so we want to be prudent around the whole business, but we feel good about where we're at. We're very happy with the quarter. Like I said, I think we got the most out of a good situation and really, really driven by strong demand on the cloud and bringing innovation to market. I mean, I think that's the way I think about this. We brought energy-assist to market. We've been talking about it for many quarters now. We've been giving a lot of visibility into the -- to the qualification process, because it is new technology that's been worked on for a very, very long time. And I think our customers are responding very strongly to that and we saw that in the results and the sequential capacity enterprise, exabyte shipments of 49% to really a record level. So we feel really good about where the portfolio is at and customers are really responding to it. That sustains from Chia. I think we're -- Chia had a big impact on the channel and inventory and it's going to take a little while for that all to normalize. So I think you have a lingering impact there. We're certainly watching overall demand, but it's tapered off from where it was, let's say mid quarter. But clearly a space we're watching. We're watching very closely. I'll ask Bob to comment as well. So it is a little hard to handicap what you're -- I think you're asking, which is how much upside is there if we had all the components we could possibly get? I do think what we do is, with what we have, we change the mix in the portfolio to get the best we can and put the product at the best route to market, whether it's in the channel or somewhere or into retail or somewhere else where we can get the best return for that particular component. But I don't know, Bob do you have any way, not to put you on the spot, but feel free to handicap that from a numbers perspective? We have a lot of operating leverage in our model and I think you saw that come into play this quarter. I mean, I think it was a really impressive improvement in terms of gross margin sequentially and a lot of what we saw on the pricing side did flow through. I mean, as we said, we saw a lot of demand on the channel driven by Chia in most cases, but across the board, we saw a good environment. And I think the team did a good job of reacting dynamically and trying to properly price the products as we went through the quarter. So we're going to continue to do that same kind of thing as we move forward and we are going to see cost takedowns. We had very good cost takedowns in Q4 on both the hard drive side and on the flash side, and as we keep price flat or even increase price, then that's obviously going to only help in terms of operating leverage. Yes, at this point I think it's where they're at in the architectural evolution of their data center of how they're adopting the technology as far as qualification. So first of all, I mean, if you're building a cloud, you're most likely our customer. Hard drives are the lion's share of storage in the cloud. But we're seeing wide adoption, I guess, is the only way I can say it. I mean, it's our customers, different customers, will be at different part, different stages of their architectural evolution, some are going to 18 as fast as they can. Some are working through a 14 transition, let's say in the second half of the year, and then will move to 18. Some are going through 16. So at this point it is just a question of how they're all transitioning their data centers. Again, we saw really strong growth throughout the quarter and as Bob said, it's nearly half of our exabyte ship capacity, enterprise exabyte shipments were on 18. So we feel really good about where the product is and like I said, the innovation of energy-assist has been fully commercialized and has been well received by our customers. Sure thing. Yes, Harlan, I was going to say same thing. I mean, we've got folks in the factories working overtime and to get every drive we can out I mean the team is obviously balancing the supply chain issues to get all the components we need, but we've got that covered in September. And so keeping again we're -- these are in places where COVID is a big deal and we've been really good about managing through that, but something got our eye on, but we're really pushing very hard to get all the components we can all the drives, we can. Sure thing. Yes, in terms of our inventory and the turns around quite a bit on the hard drive side and I'd say relatively flat, maybe even slightly worse on the flash side and that see you all going through a nodal transition, it's not a big surprise there. So and the flow-through as you saw was up significantly during the quarter. Sure, thank you. Yes so a few questions in there. So first of all in terms of CapEx we exited FY 2021 around $3 billion in growth CapEx and that's what we're expecting again in FY 2022. We are well on our way in terms of the ramp on BiCS5 and in terms of the capital investment, and we will have to obviously continue to invest in both businesses. We've got two growing businesses and they are going to require capital going forward. On the hard drive side, we're at the point where we can no longer transition the assets from the client side of the business to the capacity enterprise business. And so that means we have to be pretty cautious in terms of investments we make. That's part of why we've done some of these long term agreements and we're going to continue to be very careful in terms of capacity we've put in place. And on the flash side, the goal as we've been saying is to really grow bits at the rate that the market is growing and we think over the long-term we will be able to do that. Sure, thank you. Yes, it's a good question Shannon. And we are definitely facing inflationary pressures across the board and we've talked about the semiconductor components already on this call, and we're seeing lead times extend out. We're seeing challenges on the cost side as well. And we're going to -- we think we're going to face that across a number of different commodities. And also the discussion we need to have with our customers as well, and I think most of them are also facing inflationary pressures. So it's not something that you can work out in a single quarter, but I think over time we've got to make sure we're getting obviously an adequate return on investments we're making from a CapEx standpoint and the costs that we have in each of the products. Sure. Thank you. Oh yes, please go ahead. Yes, no, I think you got it. I mean, again we're running a portfolio across the four or five major pillars; enterprises, SSD, mobile, consumer and anchor the portfolio client SSD and then of course positions in gaming, IoT, automotive, but every quarter the mix is going to be different across that. And obviously the pricing is changing as different rates across those markets. We're clearly trying to shift as much as we can into the higher margin markets, but every quarter the mix is going to be a little bit different. And depending on what our commitments are, we have commitments to customers as to how much we're going to supply in any given quarter. So when you put that all together, the mix is a little different in Q1, and I think that's where you've got some of the difference coming from in the way you're thinking about it. Thank you. So I think the answer to that is, I don't think the answer to that is yes. Let's go through each business. On the drive side we saw a big step up this quarter driven by a number of things. We've been talking about the 18-terabyte capacity point is much better for us for a number of quarters now and we saw that play out. We obviously got some benefit from Chi as well, but predominantly innovation led story from my perspective, but we believe this business inside our company needs to be more profitable. We've talked about it several times on this call. We're now looking at this transition from client capacity to capacity enterprise, nearliner enterprise drives that is -- that era is coming to an end. It's been a long one. It's been -- it's taken a decade to go through that transition, but when we look at the exabyte growth going forward that's going to take investment and we want that investment to be fully justified. So and again it's no surprise to me that now we're talking about these more longer-term agreements and again were early days in those, but those are the conversations with customers. I remember when I came in this business, whatever five quarters ago, everything was transacted on a quarterly or even within the quarter basis and now we're moving to -- in parts of the business multi-quarter basis and I think that will continue because we need more visibility into demand to make sure we can continue to fuel the growth of the cloud. I think the cloud is incredible technology. The seminal technology of our era as I talk -- as I like to say and continuing to fuel the growth there is very important and 35% exabyte growth is going to take investments and I think that's going to take, we're going to want to see the internals of our business be able to support that. And on the flash side we're going to, just one financial comment on that. We're also continuing to innovate in hard drives and drive cost down as well. I think we think about cost down is more in the flash business, but we also continue to drive in the drive business, so we have that dynamic working as well. And on flash, we all know about how dynamic the pricing environment is. We feel very good about our technology roadmap, we've talked about that. We're at the transition point to BiCS5. We feel good about that node as we transition to that over the next couple of quarters. We will see our bit growth accelerate and that that foundational investment with Kioxia I think puts us in a very good position to have the technology roadmap, just structurally support margins in the business. Yes, clearly a better pricing environment as we're seeing helps margins in that business. We expect it to be better next quarter, that's the way we're guiding. And as we looked even beyond the second half and we look into next year, we continue to see a strong demand environment that's getting out there pretty far, but from what our customers are telling us telling us of what they think the demand is going to be for their products. Like I said we are more technology dependent than ever. We continue to hear good things about what they're going be asking for next year. So structurally we think with the technology, with the innovation we're driving in both portfolios, that puts us in a good position to continue to drive profitability in these businesses. Yes, the first one just quickly, very minimal contribution from Chia in the enterprise SSD market. Yes, we are happy with the sequential growth of the products, and we did complete a qualification at another cloud Titan, which is something we've had eyes on for a while and we've talked about. We haven't started ramping there yet, but we'll see that in the second half of the year. We also saw good demand in the channel on enterprise SSD. So we qualified with one of the very big players and we see continued growth there. We're seeing good acceptance in the channel and growth there and now we're layering in additional major customers as we go into the second half of the year. So we feel good about how the product is being accepted again. Lot of innovation in our products. We've being talking about that for many quarters, again giving visibility to the qualification process, and now we're well into the ramp and feel good about where we're at and where it's going and how it's being accepted by our customers. I suspect we're picking up share as we grow, so I don't think the market grew sequentially 39%. Again, we're focused on profitable share gains, but this has been a focus for us to get that product introduced. It's a very attractive market and get it qualified in as many places as we can. But we're going to continue driving for growth quarter over quarter. Yes, I mean as we -- I think as we've talked about, we're in this period in the hard drive business where it's been transitioning for a long time from a business that was client dominated to a business that is cloud dominated is I guess one way to think about it. And if we look at the utilization of our factories, you can see that very clearly, year-over-year the percentage of drives there were headed for the cloud versus the ones that are headed for clients has been steadily shifting over a decade and now we're at the point where we're looking at investments both in  and also when you build a bigger driver it takes longer to test, all those kinds of things, testing, capacity in the factory. So yes, as we go through those conversations, it's really important to understand from our customers what their growth is going to be. We see 30% to 35% exabyte growth in the cloud for the foreseeable future. We want to make sure that they see that same amount. And as we align on that growth and we invest in our business to support it, I think that's where this idea of long-term agreements come in place and to help drive the profitability for the business. We think the innovation is delivering, I mean it starts with delivering a product that is very, solves the customers problem and we're delivering a very strong TCO model with every generation of this product that we build. We're driving a lot of innovation. You know we talked about it here with energy-assist which is something that we've been working on for quite some time. And quite frankly it's a good accomplishment for the team, a great accomplishment. It feels good to take something that was an idea many, many years ago, and now turn it into something where the largest customers in the world are betting their business and their data center on that innovation. And so to continue to fuel that innovation engine we've got we got many, many innovations lined up to continue to drive the portfolio and making sure we can invest in that and meet the growth of our customers. Getting the economics of that right is very important. Sure, thanks. Thank you. All right everybody thanks for your time today. We really appreciate it. We will be seeing you throughout the quarter. Thanks very much."

            "content": "Thank you and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in April. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up 19% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.16. For the full fiscal year revenue was $16.9 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2020 and non-GAAP EPS was $4.55, up 50% from last year. Looking at our end markets, Client Devices revenue was $2.2 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we experienced revenue growth in both hard drives and flash and across every major product category; client HDDs, client SSDs, automotive, gaming, smart video and industrial. Mobile revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 44% sequentially and up 6% from a year ago. New product ramps in this end market drove more than double the revenue growth from just two quarters ago. Revenue generated from our latest generation energy-assisted hard drives and enterprises SSDs contributed to the growth. Our capacity enterprise hard drives grew 49% sequentially and our enterprise SSDs grew 39% sequentially. Demand for our 18-terabyte energy-assisted hard drives was particularly strong, comprising nearly half of our capacity enterprise exabytes shipments. Finally, Client Solutions revenue was $977 million, up 10% sequentially and up 42% from a year ago. Once again revenue growth was broad based across both HDD and flash and all major product categories. Turning to revenue by technology, flash revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 7% sequentially on a blended basis and up 4% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 4% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.5 billion, up 28% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 34%, while the average price per hard drive increased 18% to $97. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up 5.2 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in April. Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively ship bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our gross margin by 5.5 percentage points sequentially to 35.5%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.3% up 5.3 percentage points sequentially. This also includes a COVID-related impact of $32 million or approximately $1.3 percentage points. Operating expenses were $790 million within our guidance range. Operating income was $828 million representing 101% increase from the prior quarter and a 57% increase year-over-year. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was 9.2% and the tax rate was 13.4% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $2.16. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $994 million and free cash flow was $792 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was an outflow of $202 million. We expect growth CapEx for the next fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion. In the fiscal fourth quarter we paid off $212 million in debt, including a discretionary debt payment of $150 million. For the full fiscal year we paid down a total of $886 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.8 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. Additionally, we have already made a discretionary debt payment of $150 million in the fiscal first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement was $3.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.4 times compared to 2.8 a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the investor relations website for further details. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have unused revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Moving on to our outlook, our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows; we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 33% and 35%. We expect hard drive gross margin to be relatively flat and we expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially. We expect operating expenses to be between $755 million and $785 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 12% in the fiscal first quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to between $2.25 and $2.55 in the first quarter assuming approximately $317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave. Hey, Toshiya, it's Bob. So in terms of the cost takedowns, we actually looked at it mostly year-over-year, and we were a little bit ahead of the 15% goal we have for year-over-year cost declines and continue to feel good about 15% as the long-term goal. We are starting the nodal transition. We did this past quarter to BiCS5 and we'll continue to ramp that hard through the second half. As Dave mentioned, we expect to get the crossover in the fourth calendar quarter. So I think in terms of costs, I think we're in a good place. Hi, Karl, it's Bob. I'll start and then Dave can add in. But in terms of the guide on hard drives, we aren't actually guiding specifically by segment. We had really good gross margins on hard drives this quarter above 30% and we're expecting our gross margins to be above 30%, again in Q1 so we feel good about that. And, as we've said, we really want to continue to improve from here. We're going to be very judicious in terms of how we add capacity, because we want to continue to improve our margins over time. So Mehdi, on gross margin, I mean, first of all, we're really pleased with the 5.2 percentage point increase we had in gross margin going from Q3 to Q4. And if you look at the guidance for Q1, it's a range of 33% to 35%. So it's at the midpoint, we're still expecting to see improving gross margin. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we're expecting hard drive gross margin to be above 30% again and in terms of the flash side, it will obviously improve, but the mix is different each quarter. And we're going to improve our gross margins and probably don't have quite as healthy a mix, as we had in Q4. But again, still feel really good about the guidance range and I think it will deliver very good margin and very good profitability. No, it's really hard to say. I mean, as Dave said, I mean, particularly on that channel side, we shift a lot during the quarter. So our inventory levels are low there. If you really forced us to guess on the fourth quarter, maybe we missed out on $50 million to $100 million in revenue. But it's very hard to quantify what we would have been able to do had we had all the controllers that we wanted. And as we look at Q1, I mean, we're expecting to be able to manage through the supply chain challenges like we have for the last few quarters. And I don't really know, it's hard to quantify before we even get into the quarter what the supply issues may be, but we're going to we're going to work and it'll be a very dynamic environment and we feel good about the revenue guidance we gave. Well, certainly on the hard drive side, I'm expecting we're going to have the same logistics challenges we've had for the last year or so. So you're going to have something in the neighborhood of 1.2, 1.3 percentage points of headwind on the hard drive side. And we have to continue to work through the COVID situation from a factory perspective and supply chain perspective. And as Dave said, we've been doing it for a lot of quarters now, but the situation is not good in Asia and we need to really, really make sure we're careful in terms of how we work through that. Harlan, it is Bob. We're basically running at full capacity in the September quarter on the hard drive side, so it's not easy to get the parts and that's definitely true. But in the September quarter, I don't see it as a big factor. We'll see how that plays out as we get to the December quarter and beyond. Thank you. Yes, thanks everybody."

Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. We reported solid third quarter results above the guidance range provided in January, with revenue of $4.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 27.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.02. Sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing momentum of our high capacity energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets. As we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent than ever before. From the intelligent edge to the cloud, data storage is a fundamental component underpinning the global technology architecture. Western Digital's strengths in technology and cost leadership, expansive product portfolio and broad routes to market are providing a foundation upon which we are solidifying our position as an essential building block of the digital economy. These strengths, combined with our increased operational and strategic focus enabled by our new business unit structure, are driving results. As we continue to face a dynamic environment, we are seeing the benefits of the synergistic value in the breadth of Western Digital's portfolio, and our unique ability to deliver both hard drives and flash solutions to our diverse end markets and customer base. Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, the depth and breadth of our product line, distribution channels, cost leadership and customer base are significant differentiators. Our ability to act swiftly and shift bits to meet customer demand in various end markets, ranging from data centers to retail, enabled us to grow both revenue and gross margin in the third quarter. Within Data Center Devices and Solutions, we experienced significant growth in the quarter with our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD in a cloud titan. In addition, we are seeing many cloud customers also utilize NAND flash for their consumer product lines. This creates many opportunities for us as a strategic partner as we continue to diversify and balance the end markets we serve. We are already achieving significant progress in VR headsets, game consoles and other at-home entertainment devices where we have experienced over 10x bit growth last calendar year and expect to double again this calendar year. In Client Devices, continued strength in PC demand, along with the new game console ramps drove sequential revenue growth above typical seasonal trends. Retail remained a high-performing end market as our brand recognition, broad product portfolio and extensive distribution channels continue to distinguish Western Digital from our competitors. In particular, it was a solid quarter for gaming with our WD Black product line having maintained strong levels of interest as gamers have gravitated towards more customized solutions. By delivering reliable performance, expansive storage capabilities and a hyperrealistic gaming experience, our industry-leading WD Black portfolio is trusted by gamers to perform their best. We are also excited about the future as Western Digital's technology road map and cost leadership will continue to drive our ability to meet customers' needs. BiCS5 is in the midst of a significant ramp, exceeding customers' expectations and delivering the reliability and performance our customers depend upon. Moreover, the technology advancements we made with BiCS5 have allowed us to achieve the scale, efficiency and bit growth needed while using a lower number of layers resulting in lower costs and lower capital intensity. We continue to expect BiCS5 bit crossover later in 2021. Finally, in February, we revealed BiCS6, our next-generation flash device, based on 162 layer and CuA technology, developed in partnership with Kioxia as part of our long-standing successful joint venture, BiCS6 features numerous architectural advancements, including improved lateral scaling, which allows us to deliver this high-performing product at an optimal cost. This marks another major milestone in our 20-year relationship with Kioxia. And together, we will continue to drive innovation to meet the needs of our respective customers in their diverse applications. In HDD, revenue growth was led by capacity enterprise drives, a trend that tilts the overall HDD market to growth as demand for capacity enterprise drives will more than offset the decline in client drives. Meanwhile, retail HDD demand was better than expected, supported by continued work from home, distance learning and at-home entertainment trends. We continue to see enterprise demand stabilizing and expect to pick up as employees return to work. We have completed qualifications for our energy-assisted drives with nearly all our cloud and enterprise customers, including all the cloud titans and expect an aggressive ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives. Building on this success, we've entered into long-term agreements with a number of our cloud titans for 18-terabyte drives. These commitments underscore our product leadership and the importance of capacity enterprise drives to our data center customers. As we continue to navigate challenges brought on by COVID-19, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent. We believe this is a fundamental and sustainable trend, highlighting the importance of Western Digital's broad portfolio of storage solutions, and we're encouraged by what's ahead. In flash, improving pricing trends in the retail and transactional portions of the market are translating to better pricing in a negotiated portions of the market, and we expect this trend to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our unique ability to provide high volumes of flash and hard drive solutions through extensive distribution channels and to diversified end markets provides us with broad demand visibility, enabling our team to optimize product mix and profitability. In the cloud, we remain uniquely positioned to benefit from the strong growth in this sector, where NAND flash and hard drives are complementary solutions. We expect the strength to build as we progress through the calendar year, led by the ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives as well as broad-based growth in flash. And while we are excited about these drivers, we are also keeping close watch on some headwinds. To date, we have been able to largely mitigate the impact of the industry-wide semiconductor component shortages through proactive supply chain management. We are, however, experiencing tightness in controllers as well as flash, which could limit potential upside in the future. We also recognize that while the pandemic effects are lessening in some regions, others are unfortunately experiencing another wave of cases. We are actively managing through this environment, which continues to have ongoing impacts to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results.\nRobert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the third fiscal quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in January. Flash revenue and gross margin improvement were the primary contributors to the upside versus guidance. Total revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Looking at our end markets, client Devices revenue was $2 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, client SSD revenue was flat and notebook and desktop PC hard drive revenue was down, though it decreased less than what we're used to seeing based on typical seasonality. Gaming revenue grew, while mobile revenue was down on a sequential basis. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $1.2 billion, up 53% sequentially, but down 19% from a year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs grew sequentially. We were encouraged to see the sequential growth driven by our new energy-assisted hard drives at the 16- and 18-terabyte capacity points and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD products, both targeted for the cloud and large-scale enterprise OEMs. Lastly, Client Solutions revenue was $888 million, down 12% sequentially and up 8% from a year ago. Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially on a blended basis and flat on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 7%, while the average price per hard drive increased 14% to $82. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the third quarter was 27.7%, up 1.3 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in January. Continued success in driving down costs, coupled with an improving pricing environment and our ability to shift bits to more attractive end markets, drove our flash gross margin up 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 30.0%. Our hard drive gross margin was 25%, down 0.5 percentage points sequentially. As noted last quarter, production ramp costs of our new energy-assisted drives and a planned reduction in overall units shipped pressured gross margin. This also includes COVID-19-related impact of $31 million or approximately 1.6 percentage points. Operating expenses of $732 million were higher than guidance due to a larger-than-expected variable compensation accrual tied to our improved profitability. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal third quarter was 8%, which was well below our prior expectations and directly resulted in a $0.17 benefit to our earnings per share. We now expect our tax rate to be 17% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $1.02. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share was still well above guidance. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $116 million and free cash flow was negative $11 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was a cash outflow of $127 million. In the fiscal third quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million. We'll also be making an additional optional debt payment of $150 million this Friday, highlighting the confidence we have in our cash flow generation for the fourth quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage of 2.6x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes a $1 billion add-back of depreciation associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect both hard drive and flash revenue to be up sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect both flash and hard drive gross margin to improve sequentially as well. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $790 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $68 million and $73 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.60 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Now I'll turn it back over to Dave.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. As technology continues to advance, our powerful portfolio will remain centered on developing solutions to our customers' evolving storage needs. Western Digital's unique ability to offer complementary flash and hard drive products benefits the industry, our customers and our company as a whole. While market conditions continue improving, I believe the organization and leadership changes made over the last year are now delivering more agility, better execution and a stronger portfolio and collectively are driving results and unlocking the underlying strengths of Western Digital. We are in a unique leadership position and feel confident that we can continue to drive innovation, while delivering value for all of our stakeholders. We will now begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Congratulations on the execution in the quarter. I guess the first question I have is, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about establishing long-term purchase agreements with some of the cloud customers or cloud titans. Can you help us appreciate that a little bit more? Can you give us any context of how those agreements are structured? Are they volume-related? Are they take and pay? Just any kind of clarity on that. And how that would compare to kind of prior engagements with those customers on product cycles?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Aaron, thank you. Yes, it's something we've been working on for a while, I guess. I mean when I got here a year ago, it kind of struck me that it was a big business and it was very transactional. And the more certainty we could put around, it would be better for all of us, especially going into a world where we're going to be investing capital in this business. We're trying to judge supply and demand and get that right as the market shifts to capacity enterprise. So there are multi-quarter agreements, as you would imagine. And we talk about the amount of demand they are going to have, and we set a price for that period. So as opposed to just going quarter-by-quarter, we're extending that out to multi-quarter agreements to give us both more visibility around the business.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And I guess, maybe somewhat related to that, just thinking about the hard disk drive business as my follow-up is, I guess, a simple question is, how do we go from a 25% gross margin back to what I think is still probably the target of at least 30%, if not higher gross margin in hard disk drives? How do we think about the variables to bring us back to that 30% plus level?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I think -- I mean -- so the first part is getting out of COVID. I think we had 1.6% impact on gross margin due to COVID, so that continues to be an issue. And we're all hoping things continue to get better there. Obviously, mix is a question -- an issue as we get more client in the work from home. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely a different margin profile. And then getting to scale on the capacity points where we can continue to drive the costs down. And -- we can't control the pricing in the market, but continuing to deliver a strong TCO proposition for our customers. And that's what we're continuing to do. We believe we have a long road map of continued density and aerial density improvements on HDDs. They're the foundational storage element in the cloud, which I think is a very good place to be. And so we're working on it from all of those angles.\nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nChristopher Muse: Yes. I guess first question I was hoping to discuss just overall gross margins. So very nice uplift there. And in particular, your cost sales on the NAND side in the March quarter were fairly spectacular and clearly better than what we saw across most other NAND players. So can that 20% improvement year-on-year continue as we go through the year? And what other kind of drivers should we be thinking about impacting gross margins into June?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So we're happy where the technology is. I mean, I think we're going to -- we're still at our -- we target 15%. In some quarters, we do better, some quarters maybe we do a little worse than that. We're in a good spot. A lot of the portfolio is on BiCS4, which is a very high-performing node for us. So we're very happy with the cost downs. Hopefully, you tuned into Dr. Sivaram's discussion of NAND technology and kind of what's driving, all of this. We do believe very strongly in our technology road map with Kioxia. Between us, we're the biggest investor in NAND. And so we have a lot of confidence in our road map and to be able to sustain that. As we look into the next quarter, we talked about it. We continue to see a good pricing environment. So we expect to continue to get good cost downs in the portfolio and in a rising price environment that puts us in a good spot to drive gross margin.\nChristopher Muse: Okay. Very helpful.\nRobert Eulau: And we're beginning to ramp our BiCS5 112-layer technology as well, which will continue to help bring the cost down.\nChristopher Muse: Great. And then, I guess, can you speak a bit to the rebound you saw in the enterprise HDD side, pretty strong, up 16% sequential units? Can you share with us how to think about 16-, 18-terabyte ramp and the prospect for faster growth as we go through the year?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We expect sequential growth in that market. I think this quarter, we had a good -- we had basically a balanced shipment of our capacity enterprise across 14, 16 and 18, and we see that shifting strongly to 18 sequentially, and we expect that to drive -- we see sequential exabyte growth and also sequential gross margin improvement in the portfolio as we move forward as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Also, on the enterprise side, if you could talk about the enterprise NVMe progress that you've had? You're citing a cloud titan customer there. Are there prospects for more? And where would you say -- I know you had a late start with enterprise NVMe. Where would you say your share is? And can you kind of get to where your share in the enterprise is similar to your share and overall NAND?\nDavid Goeckeler: So we're working on calls with the big enterprise OEMs, so that's still in process. As I talked about last time, that's a multi-quarter process. It's going along fine. We're seeing good demand in the channel for that product. So that's a good indication. As far as where we're going to land on share, I mean, I think one of the things to -- we're really running a balanced portfolio across a whole bunch of different markets we're in from client SSD to mobility. I think the big thing for us is to get the enterprise SSD qualified and now start to ship at scale. But we're still going to run a balanced portfolio across the big markets we have, which is client SSD, mobility, enterprise SSD and, of course, retail. And then with things like gaming coming up quickly as well. So we feel good about where the product is. We think it was a major milestone for us last quarter when we got the call done at a cloud titan, and we saw the benefits of that this past quarter.\nJoseph Moore: Great. And then my follow-up on 330 basis points of gross margin improvement is pretty significant. Can you give us a qualitative sense of how much of that is coming from NAND versus drives?\nRobert Eulau: Well, gross margins were up in both -- I'm sorry, gross margins were up on the flash side. They're actually down sequentially.\nJoseph Moore: Yes. I mean more in the June quarter, your guidance.\nRobert Eulau: In the June quarter. Yes. Sequentially, will be up in both businesses, probably driven a little bit more on the flash side.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Congrats on the strong results and outlook. David, you talked about shortages in your NAND business as it relates to controllers and perhaps raw NAND as well. Can you talk a little bit about the actual impact you saw in the quarter? What's embedded in your June quarter guidance and when you'd expect some of these issues to be resolved?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So we're working on -- I mean, obviously, we're working to get as much supply as we can. I mean this past quarter, we did see shortages in controllers, let's say, in places like Chromebooks, where we probably couldn't get as many controllers as we would have liked and could have shipped a little more into that. But in general, what we're able to do is with the supply we have is shift the portfolio around where we get the biggest return for that, whether it's moving those controllers to products in the channel or in retail -- from retail into the channel and vice versa, where we're going to get the highest return. So the agility, I think, that the team is implementing on all of our different go-to-market routes has been very beneficial over the last couple of quarters, and I expect it to be going forward as well. So we're able to mitigate it a little bit. We're not able to completely escape it, but we're going to continue working to get all the supply we can. And we definitely know what the forecast. It's matched to the supply we have. So we don't expect any surprises from that regard.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. And then as a quick follow-up. I just wanted to get your thoughts on NAND supply/demand going forward. Clearly, the near term is looking really good, and you spoke to that in your prepared remarks. But as you start to plan for fiscal '22, what are your thoughts on the overall market supply/demand and your intentions from a CapEx perspective? You obviously want to make the transitions and maintain share, but at the same time, you don't want to flood the market with too much supply. So what's sort of the debate internally?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So you got it right. I mean we're going to invest to maintain share. We feel good about the demand situation. I mean '22 is pretty far out. As you know, of course, we guide 1 quarter at a time, I have to say that. But yes, we continue to see demand as strong into the second half of this year, certainly. I mean we're -- we -- whether it's in the PC market or in the cloud infrastructure market, we're pretty bullish. So we'll manage it through the end of the year and be disciplined with our CapEx investment and go one quarter a time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Dave, I want to go back to the long-term agreements on 18 TB. Is there any share basis for those agreements? And if not, how much share are you targeting at these customers?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We don't go into that much detail on a customer-by-customer basis. I mean we -- it's fair to say with these customers, we have long-standing and very deep relationships given our position in their data centers and given that 90% of the storage in the cloud is on hard drive. So it's just about getting more visibility of what their plans are and get anything aligned with where we're going and making sure that our business is aligned with where their business is headed. It's kind of as simple as that to give us more visibility and try and move the market, as I said, from this transactional quarter to time to allow us both to plan for what the next several quarters look like.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And as a follow-up, on the ACD gross margins improving in the June quarter, is that more mix related or lower cost headwinds? Can you just help us think through what you think are more transitory maybe in the cost headwind side versus an improving mix here?\nDavid Goeckeler: A big part of it is mix. I think we've been talking for a long time that 18 capacity point is a better point for us. And as I said, this quarter, we shipped pretty balanced number of 14s, 16s and 18s, and we'll see that tilt strongly to 18s next quarter.\nRobert Eulau: And I think the costs will get better quarter-to-quarter as well. We slowed down production a little bit in the March quarter, and we're back at full production here in the June quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: David, it's been about a year or so since you joined the company. And remember, when you first joined, you were doing somewhere around $250 million of annualized earnings. And fast forward 12 months, you're almost at a $6 annualized earning. Great improvement, but still well below 2017, 2018, when the company was doing north of $10 of earnings. And I'm not asking you to give me forecast or guide for 1 or 2 years out. But I think it would be very helpful if you could articulate your views as to how earnings are going to improve here, assuming that you just continue to execute? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think it's what -- I think you're starting to see the better execution. And on the flash side, build out the portfolio across a number of end markets, which I think that enterprise SSD was a big piece of getting that established with the cloud titans. We clearly have a very strong client SSD portfolio. We have, I think, a very strong retail portfolio. Mobility, we've talked about. We stay qualified with all the top vendors. We very much participate in that market, maybe less than -- definitely less than some others. And then we have a lot of new products coming around gaming and smart home devices, where because of our strong relationships with those big cloud customers that also drive that portfolio gives us kind of a front-row seat as those are developed. So I think it's built out the portfolio and then use our routes to market to deliver the best return we can, given the pricing environment in the market. And I think we're able to do that in flash this quarter and balance the portfolio across all the markets and put the agility in the system to make sure that we're doing that. And I would say from a year ago to where we are now and the way we executed the last quarter, there's just much more agility in the system and to be able to react and get the best outcome we can. In the hard drive side, it's drive -- continue to drive aerial density and leadership, return to a leadership position as we did with 18 and then continue that forward. It's a good market. I think we've had a long-standing position there. And then I think there's -- we've seen the synergy between the 2 portfolios in the client space. We have a great client SSD portfolio where these technologies were substitutes for each other. We had long-standing relationships with those customers where we can manage that transition. And in the data center, they're more complementary technologies, and I think the ability to execute that synergy is in front of us.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on HDD. I believe you're still are restricted with shipment to certain customers, but your primary competitor has continued to ship. How do you see that geography and specific customers there playing to your disadvantage? And I'm assuming that you're still restricted.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We're -- we've been -- since the commerce rules came out, I think back in September, we stopped shipping per the rules. We talked to commerce frequently. We have our own attorneys and outside firms. We know that, that's the right position and that's the position we continue to be in. The licenses are pending with commerce, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't think there's been any -- there hasn't been any movement there recently. As far as what our competitors do, and I can't speak to what they're doing. So I only have insight into our position, and we are clearly not shipping to places where we're not supposed to per commerce department regulation.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: My first question is on the 18-terabyte drives. First of all, congrats on all the qualification. But in terms of the ramp, do you expect your 18-terabyte drives to cross over the 14-terabyte drives exiting this calendar year? And will 18 terabyte be margin accretive right off the bat? Maybe a follow-up to that is, how are you thinking about strategy in terms of ramping 16 versus 18?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So we expect 18 to be the primary -- the highest volume we shipped this quarter. So yes, to the first question, and yes, we expect it to be margin accretive. We expect sequential improvement in HDD gross margin. What was the second question again, please?\nSidney Ho: The second part, it's 16 versus 18. Are you putting all your eggs into the 18-terabyte basket and 16 is just its whatever the customers are asking for?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Well, I mean, I think it's always whatever the customer is asking for. So every customer is at a different point in the evolution of their data center of what they're deploying. Some are still deploying 14 at scale. Some went to 18 as quickly as possible, and others are at different points of deploying 16 or 18. And so we meet the customers where they are in that process. So -- but we expect 18 to be the predominant point going forward. It's just a better TCO equation. So it's -- you would expect the customers to go there when they can, given their own internal architectural evolution.\nSidney Ho: Got it. Maybe a follow-up to the nearline side of things. Given the improvement of -- in the enterprise side that you're seeing and, obviously, the cloud has been strong, what is your expectation for the industry-wide exabyte growth for nearline drive this year? And how do you think you'll stack up against that this year?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We see a quarter of strong growth coming up. I think we're still in that around 35% exabyte growth for the year. So -- and as the market shifts to 18, I think that we're an incrementally stronger position. So that's how I expect the rest of the year to play out.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\nThomas O'Malley: Congrats on the really nice results. My first question was around end markets. You guys gave some helpful color on the HDD and flash side. Could you talk to what you guys see Client Devices, Data Center Devices and Client Solutions kind of doing into the June quarter? Just any general color would be helpful there.\nDavid Goeckeler: I mean, I think in data center, we expect improvement. I mean I'm trying to think here around modular seasonality. I mean devices are very strong. I mean we saw a lot of strength in PC and client, and I think we continue to see -- we saw -- this past quarter, we saw decline but the way better than seasonal decline. So we expect that to continue. We think that market is strong. Our customers are telling us that market is strong. The number of units shipped is up. So that continues to be a good market. I think data center with 18 ramping stronger. You're going to see growth there. And I think in the retail space, we'll see sequential growth, but probably a little smaller than the others, but still very good performance.\nThomas O'Malley: That's helpful. My follow-up was really around the cadence of gross margins. You guys indicated that you should see some HDD gross margins that are improving sequentially. But can you talk to the cadence for the year? I think that the target longer term is $30 million and even above that. But obviously, with nearline drives becoming a bigger part of the mix and some of this COVID headwinds coming off, can you talk to the progression that you guys are expecting internally? And just kind of the progression from here to the 30s?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think we're going to forecast at 1 quarter at a time, but we're working -- the teams are working very hard to do that they're going to do in any storage market, which has continued to bring down the costs. And as you scale the products, you'll bring down the cost. So I think the whole industry is driving back to 30% gross margins. I think we're going to get there one step at a time, but we're going to work on both sides of it is make sure we've got good supply/demand matching on kind of what the demand is in the market. And then we talked about multi-quarter supply agreements, I think, which helps give some certainty and then work on the cost side a bit. So we're -- every quarter, we're focused on all those elements, and we'll continue to drive it. Now it starts with delivering a great value proposition for our customers and continuing to drive a better TCO equation as we drive higher and higher aerial densities. And we've got a long road map on aerial density improvement. A big piece of that was us implementing or introducing energy assist. And that was a big thing with our 16, 18. As we're now just starting to ramp the '18, we've got energy assist in the market. That's -- there's well over a decade of research behind that, and we've now commercialized it. And so that gives us many generations on that technology to continue to improve aerial density, which is going to improve the TCO equation for our customers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: I'm just curious with regard to your cloud customers. If you believe they're pretty much through the digestion period of the excess capacity? I know we've seen some on a couple of weeks over that they're starting to ramp up CapEx again. But I'm curious what you're hearing from them? And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think the word I used last time was cloud digestion abating when we talked about this. But they're all in a slightly different spot, but we're into an ingestion phase for the most part.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And then I was curious in terms of the tightness in components in overall market. What kind of impact is that having on your working capital? We're looking at some of the movements in AP and inventory.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. No, that's a good question. And we definitely are carrying a little more inventory than we normally would, particularly on the hard drive side because of the tightness on controllers. And also, frankly, because of the logistics costs associated with COVID-19, we're putting more products on the ocean and not in the air. So it's definitely having an impact in terms of working capital in that respect. Our accounts payable did go down this quarter. I mean that really was a result of a slowing down on the production in the March quarter, and I think it will come back up again this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tristan Gerra with Baird.\nTristan Gerra: Just following up on the earlier question about supply/demand. We've had some peers talk about their concern around seen some excess capacity coming in NAND. I know it's too early to pull out an outlook for the next fiscal year, but is capacity in that industry-wide a concern in your view? Or do you see a path that ultimately could get you back to the type of peak gross margin that you reported in earlier back in the 2018 time frame?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. It's not something we're overly worried about at this point. I think the industry has been pretty disciplined for the last several years. And I think there's now pretty strong demand in the market. So I mean, we feel pretty good about the balance of supply/demand in the market going forward. I mean, again, there's -- even the -- well, let me just leave it at that. We're pretty happy with where supply/demand balance is. I mean, I think everybody is trying to figure out what's the long-term demand for technology coming out of pandemic. It's kind of a unique situation, so -- but we're staying very close to it. And our view is that industry has been pretty balanced on the whole topic.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investments.\nJames Suva: And I'll ask both my questions at the same time, and you can answer in any order you want. But the data center softness, is the visibility there getting better, the digestion phase? And are we a long ways to go or kind of mostly through the worst part? Or is demand coming back for that kind of on the data center? And then you mentioned longer-term relationships and contracts with cloud titans and hyperscalers. Do they allow for flexibility and pricing? The reason why I ask is recent NAND pricing came out and it was quite positive. And we just want to make sure that you're not missing the opportunity for better economics from pricing. And so I was just kind of wondering without any specific some of your relationships of quantity and volumes and pricing, are there some abilities to adjust it? Or do you get locked in and maybe pricing will or won't help you?\nDavid Goeckeler: I think your second issue is, without going into all the details, is not a concern for us. On the first issue, I mean, I think we saw, first of all, very strong sequential growth in data center for us this quarter of 53%, although it was down -- I get your point year-over-year. I was very strong compared a year ago on exabyte shipment, but we expect sequential growth there in exabyte shipments on the drive side and I think up on flash as well, maybe not as strong as the expected growth we expect in hard drives as 18 really starts to be the major point in the industry. But we see sequential improvement there, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Congrats on the strong results. I guess just going back to the flash gross margin and the balance that you guys are seeing right now, do you feel like you're sort of to 30% sooner than expected, which is a positive thing? And if so, how would you like us to think about if supply/demand remains balanced on the flash side? How to think about margins going through the second half of the calendar year? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I guess one way to think about that is we delivered above what we guided. So I think we're ahead of where we thought the market would be when we walked into it. And a lot of that is we have really strong exposure to a lot of transactional markets in the channel and in retail. And as price tightens, it allows us to move pricing in those big markets, much faster than other markets, OEM markets, which are quarter-by-quarter phenomena -- I mean, not phenomenon, quarter-by-quarter negotiation. So yes. I mean, I think the market was good for us. And as I said, the go-to-market teams and the BU teams were very agile as far as shifting our supply around on where we could get the best return for it in the quarter. As far as going forward, I mean, we're guiding for sequential improvement in flash gross margin. We're seeing that. We saw the pricing strength that we -- or firmness that we saw in the transactional markets translate into the negotiated markets. I think last quarter, we were waiting to see if that was going to happen. We see that going into Q4. And so we're definitely forecasting incrementally stronger flash margins in this current quarter.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay. And it sounds like just structurally, it feels like maybe that could actually follow through just because it feels like the dynamics are more at the beginning as well. I guess my follow-up is, it seems like on your CapEx, it seems like you've lowered the CapEx expectation just slightly for fiscal year '21, if I'm seeing that accurately. And I was just wondering if there's any direct reason for that and what would be underpinning that if there is. And that's it for me.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. No, that's a good observation. And we expected CapEx to be around $3 billion this year, pretty much all year. The main delta is we actually sold some real estate this past quarter to the tune of about $100 million.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNikolay Todorov: David, if I heard correctly, you talked about seeing cloud titans also starting to use your client SSD products for their consumer base business. I think that's the first time we hear about that. So can you maybe impact that a little bit? How should we think about the opportunity? And are you addressing those -- that opportunity with your existing portfolio?\nDavid Goeckeler: No, not necessarily our client products. There is some of that because I think the easiest way to think about it is a lot of these big cloud titans also have big consumer portfolios. Whether it's gaming, tablets, VR headsets, that's what I'm talking about us participating in those builds, in those parts of the market as well. And as part of that go-to-market synergy we've talked about, I think we tend to only think of it as HDDs and enterprise SSDs, but it's much broader than that, given the relationship we have from the HDD business with these customers and the depth of the relationship. And they all -- where most of them also have big consumer portfolio as well, whether it's home automation or the kind of things I talked about. So our ability to participate in those parts of the market for flash is just what we're talking about.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: On the NAND gross margins as well. I didn't hear you talk about K1 costs. So I'm guessing they came down pretty meaningfully. But I guess my question is, as we look through the next few quarters, you do have additional fabs coming online, either it's K2 or Y7. I'm just wondering how we should think about any potential incremental costs from those new factories.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. So I don't think we heard quite all the beginning of your comment, but you're correct that the K1 period expenses are immaterial now. We've ramped there to normal volume levels, and so those costs are getting inventory. So it's -- I think we're kind of in a normal state. As New York fabs come on, it's not going to have as big an impact from a start-up cost standpoint as the greenfield that we did with K1. So definitely, you're bringing on some fixed costs, but we'll also be bringing production volumes up and amortizing those costs over a bigger base because we have multiple fabs on a given campus.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Two questions real quick. First of all, on the taxes, Bob, is the 17% tax rate kind of here to stay? Do you think it can go a little bit lower? And then secondly, I apologize if I missed this, but have you talked about sort of the recent trends in high capacity video HDDs? And what you're expecting going forward?\nRobert Eulau: I do taxes, and Dave didn't talk about video. So yes, and we -- this has come up in prior calls. I mean we've been in a situation over the last couple of years where our operating profits have been below what we expected. And we have minimum taxes that we have to pay around the world. And so our rate was higher than what we would consider normal the last couple of years. Now as we're forecasting the rest of this fiscal year with the profitability we're expecting, we're very confident in the rate of 17%. And it will be -- as we look to future years, it will be a function of how profitable we are in those years. But right now, I think a good planning number is 17%.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Steven, we haven't talked about high-definition video or in particular, but I mean, one way to think about it is just driving more demand for storage. I think all the devices we carry have more and more capability to store higher definition video, which is just driving the need for more storage per device. So if you have something more specific than that, I'm happy to follow-up on and go...\nSteven Fox: Yes. Yes, I just was -- if you could just maybe expand on what you're seeing into the June quarter, like, I think there was some seasonality last quarter. How you have availability to ship to that market?\nDavid Goeckeler: Smart video, the smart video market, I'm sorry, I misinterpreted. Smart video right in the HDD market. We see -- that market has been pretty stable. I think we see some improvement in it. But I mean, I don't think there's anything that's particularly noteworthy, except that it's a good market for us and continue to move forward.\nRobert Eulau: Yes, it's a growing market.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Look, we really appreciate you spending time with us. We'll follow up with you throughout the quarter. And again, thanks for joining us. Take care.\nRobert Eulau: Yes. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. We reported solid third quarter results above the guidance range provided in January, with revenue of $4.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 27.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.02. Sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing momentum of our high capacity energy-assisted drives and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs, improving NAND flash pricing trends, along with the continued accelerated digital transformation across end markets. As we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent than ever before. From the intelligent edge to the cloud, data storage is a fundamental component underpinning the global technology architecture. Western Digital's strengths in technology and cost leadership, expansive product portfolio and broad routes to market are providing a foundation upon which we are solidifying our position as an essential building block of the digital economy. These strengths, combined with our increased operational and strategic focus enabled by our new business unit structure, are driving results. As we continue to face a dynamic environment, we are seeing the benefits of the synergistic value in the breadth of Western Digital's portfolio, and our unique ability to deliver both hard drives and flash solutions to our diverse end markets and customer base. Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, the depth and breadth of our product line, distribution channels, cost leadership and customer base are significant differentiators. Our ability to act swiftly and shift bits to meet customer demand in various end markets, ranging from data centers to retail, enabled us to grow both revenue and gross margin in the third quarter. Within Data Center Devices and Solutions, we experienced significant growth in the quarter with our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD in a cloud titan. In addition, we are seeing many cloud customers also utilize NAND flash for their consumer product lines. This creates many opportunities for us as a strategic partner as we continue to diversify and balance the end markets we serve. We are already achieving significant progress in VR headsets, game consoles and other at-home entertainment devices where we have experienced over 10x bit growth last calendar year and expect to double again this calendar year. In Client Devices, continued strength in PC demand, along with the new game console ramps drove sequential revenue growth above typical seasonal trends. Retail remained a high-performing end market as our brand recognition, broad product portfolio and extensive distribution channels continue to distinguish Western Digital from our competitors. In particular, it was a solid quarter for gaming with our WD Black product line having maintained strong levels of interest as gamers have gravitated towards more customized solutions. By delivering reliable performance, expansive storage capabilities and a hyperrealistic gaming experience, our industry-leading WD Black portfolio is trusted by gamers to perform their best. We are also excited about the future as Western Digital's technology road map and cost leadership will continue to drive our ability to meet customers' needs. BiCS5 is in the midst of a significant ramp, exceeding customers' expectations and delivering the reliability and performance our customers depend upon. Moreover, the technology advancements we made with BiCS5 have allowed us to achieve the scale, efficiency and bit growth needed while using a lower number of layers resulting in lower costs and lower capital intensity. We continue to expect BiCS5 bit crossover later in 2021. Finally, in February, we revealed BiCS6, our next-generation flash device, based on 162 layer and CuA technology, developed in partnership with Kioxia as part of our long-standing successful joint venture, BiCS6 features numerous architectural advancements, including improved lateral scaling, which allows us to deliver this high-performing product at an optimal cost. This marks another major milestone in our 20-year relationship with Kioxia. And together, we will continue to drive innovation to meet the needs of our respective customers in their diverse applications. In HDD, revenue growth was led by capacity enterprise drives, a trend that tilts the overall HDD market to growth as demand for capacity enterprise drives will more than offset the decline in client drives. Meanwhile, retail HDD demand was better than expected, supported by continued work from home, distance learning and at-home entertainment trends. We continue to see enterprise demand stabilizing and expect to pick up as employees return to work. We have completed qualifications for our energy-assisted drives with nearly all our cloud and enterprise customers, including all the cloud titans and expect an aggressive ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives. Building on this success, we've entered into long-term agreements with a number of our cloud titans for 18-terabyte drives. These commitments underscore our product leadership and the importance of capacity enterprise drives to our data center customers. As we continue to navigate challenges brought on by COVID-19, we know that the world is not only more technology-enabled, but also more technology dependent. We believe this is a fundamental and sustainable trend, highlighting the importance of Western Digital's broad portfolio of storage solutions, and we're encouraged by what's ahead. In flash, improving pricing trends in the retail and transactional portions of the market are translating to better pricing in a negotiated portions of the market, and we expect this trend to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our unique ability to provide high volumes of flash and hard drive solutions through extensive distribution channels and to diversified end markets provides us with broad demand visibility, enabling our team to optimize product mix and profitability. In the cloud, we remain uniquely positioned to benefit from the strong growth in this sector, where NAND flash and hard drives are complementary solutions. We expect the strength to build as we progress through the calendar year, led by the ramp of our 18-terabyte hard drives as well as broad-based growth in flash. And while we are excited about these drivers, we are also keeping close watch on some headwinds. To date, we have been able to largely mitigate the impact of the industry-wide semiconductor component shortages through proactive supply chain management. We are, however, experiencing tightness in controllers as well as flash, which could limit potential upside in the future. We also recognize that while the pandemic effects are lessening in some regions, others are unfortunately experiencing another wave of cases. We are actively managing through this environment, which continues to have ongoing impacts to our business. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. As technology continues to advance, our powerful portfolio will remain centered on developing solutions to our customers' evolving storage needs. Western Digital's unique ability to offer complementary flash and hard drive products benefits the industry, our customers and our company as a whole. While market conditions continue improving, I believe the organization and leadership changes made over the last year are now delivering more agility, better execution and a stronger portfolio and collectively are driving results and unlocking the underlying strengths of Western Digital. We are in a unique leadership position and feel confident that we can continue to drive innovation, while delivering value for all of our stakeholders. We will now begin the Q&A session. Yes. Aaron, thank you. Yes, it's something we've been working on for a while, I guess. I mean when I got here a year ago, it kind of struck me that it was a big business and it was very transactional. And the more certainty we could put around, it would be better for all of us, especially going into a world where we're going to be investing capital in this business. We're trying to judge supply and demand and get that right as the market shifts to capacity enterprise. So there are multi-quarter agreements, as you would imagine. And we talk about the amount of demand they are going to have, and we set a price for that period. So as opposed to just going quarter-by-quarter, we're extending that out to multi-quarter agreements to give us both more visibility around the business. Well, I think -- I mean -- so the first part is getting out of COVID. I think we had 1.6% impact on gross margin due to COVID, so that continues to be an issue. And we're all hoping things continue to get better there. Obviously, mix is a question -- an issue as we get more client in the work from home. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely a different margin profile. And then getting to scale on the capacity points where we can continue to drive the costs down. And -- we can't control the pricing in the market, but continuing to deliver a strong TCO proposition for our customers. And that's what we're continuing to do. We believe we have a long road map of continued density and aerial density improvements on HDDs. They're the foundational storage element in the cloud, which I think is a very good place to be. And so we're working on it from all of those angles. Yes. So we're happy where the technology is. I mean, I think we're going to -- we're still at our -- we target 15%. In some quarters, we do better, some quarters maybe we do a little worse than that. We're in a good spot. A lot of the portfolio is on BiCS4, which is a very high-performing node for us. So we're very happy with the cost downs. Hopefully, you tuned into Dr. Sivaram's discussion of NAND technology and kind of what's driving, all of this. We do believe very strongly in our technology road map with Kioxia. Between us, we're the biggest investor in NAND. And so we have a lot of confidence in our road map and to be able to sustain that. As we look into the next quarter, we talked about it. We continue to see a good pricing environment. So we expect to continue to get good cost downs in the portfolio and in a rising price environment that puts us in a good spot to drive gross margin. Yes. We expect sequential growth in that market. I think this quarter, we had a good -- we had basically a balanced shipment of our capacity enterprise across 14, 16 and 18, and we see that shifting strongly to 18 sequentially, and we expect that to drive -- we see sequential exabyte growth and also sequential gross margin improvement in the portfolio as we move forward as well. So we're working on calls with the big enterprise OEMs, so that's still in process. As I talked about last time, that's a multi-quarter process. It's going along fine. We're seeing good demand in the channel for that product. So that's a good indication. As far as where we're going to land on share, I mean, I think one of the things to -- we're really running a balanced portfolio across a whole bunch of different markets we're in from client SSD to mobility. I think the big thing for us is to get the enterprise SSD qualified and now start to ship at scale. But we're still going to run a balanced portfolio across the big markets we have, which is client SSD, mobility, enterprise SSD and, of course, retail. And then with things like gaming coming up quickly as well. So we feel good about where the product is. We think it was a major milestone for us last quarter when we got the call done at a cloud titan, and we saw the benefits of that this past quarter. Yes. So we're working on -- I mean, obviously, we're working to get as much supply as we can. I mean this past quarter, we did see shortages in controllers, let's say, in places like Chromebooks, where we probably couldn't get as many controllers as we would have liked and could have shipped a little more into that. But in general, what we're able to do is with the supply we have is shift the portfolio around where we get the biggest return for that, whether it's moving those controllers to products in the channel or in retail -- from retail into the channel and vice versa, where we're going to get the highest return. So the agility, I think, that the team is implementing on all of our different go-to-market routes has been very beneficial over the last couple of quarters, and I expect it to be going forward as well. So we're able to mitigate it a little bit. We're not able to completely escape it, but we're going to continue working to get all the supply we can. And we definitely know what the forecast. It's matched to the supply we have. So we don't expect any surprises from that regard. Yes. So you got it right. I mean we're going to invest to maintain share. We feel good about the demand situation. I mean '22 is pretty far out. As you know, of course, we guide 1 quarter at a time, I have to say that. But yes, we continue to see demand as strong into the second half of this year, certainly. I mean we're -- we -- whether it's in the PC market or in the cloud infrastructure market, we're pretty bullish. So we'll manage it through the end of the year and be disciplined with our CapEx investment and go one quarter a time. Yes. We don't go into that much detail on a customer-by-customer basis. I mean we -- it's fair to say with these customers, we have long-standing and very deep relationships given our position in their data centers and given that 90% of the storage in the cloud is on hard drive. So it's just about getting more visibility of what their plans are and get anything aligned with where we're going and making sure that our business is aligned with where their business is headed. It's kind of as simple as that to give us more visibility and try and move the market, as I said, from this transactional quarter to time to allow us both to plan for what the next several quarters look like. A big part of it is mix. I think we've been talking for a long time that 18 capacity point is a better point for us. And as I said, this quarter, we shipped pretty balanced number of 14s, 16s and 18s, and we'll see that tilt strongly to 18s next quarter. Yes. I mean, I think it's what -- I think you're starting to see the better execution. And on the flash side, build out the portfolio across a number of end markets, which I think that enterprise SSD was a big piece of getting that established with the cloud titans. We clearly have a very strong client SSD portfolio. We have, I think, a very strong retail portfolio. Mobility, we've talked about. We stay qualified with all the top vendors. We very much participate in that market, maybe less than -- definitely less than some others. And then we have a lot of new products coming around gaming and smart home devices, where because of our strong relationships with those big cloud customers that also drive that portfolio gives us kind of a front-row seat as those are developed. So I think it's built out the portfolio and then use our routes to market to deliver the best return we can, given the pricing environment in the market. And I think we're able to do that in flash this quarter and balance the portfolio across all the markets and put the agility in the system to make sure that we're doing that. And I would say from a year ago to where we are now and the way we executed the last quarter, there's just much more agility in the system and to be able to react and get the best outcome we can. In the hard drive side, it's drive -- continue to drive aerial density and leadership, return to a leadership position as we did with 18 and then continue that forward. It's a good market. I think we've had a long-standing position there. And then I think there's -- we've seen the synergy between the 2 portfolios in the client space. We have a great client SSD portfolio where these technologies were substitutes for each other. We had long-standing relationships with those customers where we can manage that transition. And in the data center, they're more complementary technologies, and I think the ability to execute that synergy is in front of us. Yes. We're -- we've been -- since the commerce rules came out, I think back in September, we stopped shipping per the rules. We talked to commerce frequently. We have our own attorneys and outside firms. We know that, that's the right position and that's the position we continue to be in. The licenses are pending with commerce, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't think there's been any -- there hasn't been any movement there recently. As far as what our competitors do, and I can't speak to what they're doing. So I only have insight into our position, and we are clearly not shipping to places where we're not supposed to per commerce department regulation. Yes. So we expect 18 to be the primary -- the highest volume we shipped this quarter. So yes, to the first question, and yes, we expect it to be margin accretive. We expect sequential improvement in HDD gross margin. What was the second question again, please? Yes. Well, I mean, I think it's always whatever the customer is asking for. So every customer is at a different point in the evolution of their data center of what they're deploying. Some are still deploying 14 at scale. Some went to 18 as quickly as possible, and others are at different points of deploying 16 or 18. And so we meet the customers where they are in that process. So -- but we expect 18 to be the predominant point going forward. It's just a better TCO equation. So it's -- you would expect the customers to go there when they can, given their own internal architectural evolution. Yes. We see a quarter of strong growth coming up. I think we're still in that around 35% exabyte growth for the year. So -- and as the market shifts to 18, I think that we're an incrementally stronger position. So that's how I expect the rest of the year to play out. I mean, I think in data center, we expect improvement. I mean I'm trying to think here around modular seasonality. I mean devices are very strong. I mean we saw a lot of strength in PC and client, and I think we continue to see -- we saw -- this past quarter, we saw decline but the way better than seasonal decline. So we expect that to continue. We think that market is strong. Our customers are telling us that market is strong. The number of units shipped is up. So that continues to be a good market. I think data center with 18 ramping stronger. You're going to see growth there. And I think in the retail space, we'll see sequential growth, but probably a little smaller than the others, but still very good performance. Yes. I mean, I think we're going to forecast at 1 quarter at a time, but we're working -- the teams are working very hard to do that they're going to do in any storage market, which has continued to bring down the costs. And as you scale the products, you'll bring down the cost. So I think the whole industry is driving back to 30% gross margins. I think we're going to get there one step at a time, but we're going to work on both sides of it is make sure we've got good supply/demand matching on kind of what the demand is in the market. And then we talked about multi-quarter supply agreements, I think, which helps give some certainty and then work on the cost side a bit. So we're -- every quarter, we're focused on all those elements, and we'll continue to drive it. Now it starts with delivering a great value proposition for our customers and continuing to drive a better TCO equation as we drive higher and higher aerial densities. And we've got a long road map on aerial density improvement. A big piece of that was us implementing or introducing energy assist. And that was a big thing with our 16, 18. As we're now just starting to ramp the '18, we've got energy assist in the market. That's -- there's well over a decade of research behind that, and we've now commercialized it. And so that gives us many generations on that technology to continue to improve aerial density, which is going to improve the TCO equation for our customers. Yes. I think the word I used last time was cloud digestion abating when we talked about this. But they're all in a slightly different spot, but we're into an ingestion phase for the most part. Yes. It's not something we're overly worried about at this point. I think the industry has been pretty disciplined for the last several years. And I think there's now pretty strong demand in the market. So I mean, we feel pretty good about the balance of supply/demand in the market going forward. I mean, again, there's -- even the -- well, let me just leave it at that. We're pretty happy with where supply/demand balance is. I mean, I think everybody is trying to figure out what's the long-term demand for technology coming out of pandemic. It's kind of a unique situation, so -- but we're staying very close to it. And our view is that industry has been pretty balanced on the whole topic. I think your second issue is, without going into all the details, is not a concern for us. On the first issue, I mean, I think we saw, first of all, very strong sequential growth in data center for us this quarter of 53%, although it was down -- I get your point year-over-year. I was very strong compared a year ago on exabyte shipment, but we expect sequential growth there in exabyte shipments on the drive side and I think up on flash as well, maybe not as strong as the expected growth we expect in hard drives as 18 really starts to be the major point in the industry. But we see sequential improvement there, Jim. Yes. I guess one way to think about that is we delivered above what we guided. So I think we're ahead of where we thought the market would be when we walked into it. And a lot of that is we have really strong exposure to a lot of transactional markets in the channel and in retail. And as price tightens, it allows us to move pricing in those big markets, much faster than other markets, OEM markets, which are quarter-by-quarter phenomena -- I mean, not phenomenon, quarter-by-quarter negotiation. So yes. I mean, I think the market was good for us. And as I said, the go-to-market teams and the BU teams were very agile as far as shifting our supply around on where we could get the best return for it in the quarter. As far as going forward, I mean, we're guiding for sequential improvement in flash gross margin. We're seeing that. We saw the pricing strength that we -- or firmness that we saw in the transactional markets translate into the negotiated markets. I think last quarter, we were waiting to see if that was going to happen. We see that going into Q4. And so we're definitely forecasting incrementally stronger flash margins in this current quarter. No, not necessarily our client products. There is some of that because I think the easiest way to think about it is a lot of these big cloud titans also have big consumer portfolios. Whether it's gaming, tablets, VR headsets, that's what I'm talking about us participating in those builds, in those parts of the market as well. And as part of that go-to-market synergy we've talked about, I think we tend to only think of it as HDDs and enterprise SSDs, but it's much broader than that, given the relationship we have from the HDD business with these customers and the depth of the relationship. And they all -- where most of them also have big consumer portfolio as well, whether it's home automation or the kind of things I talked about. So our ability to participate in those parts of the market for flash is just what we're talking about. Yes, Steven, we haven't talked about high-definition video or in particular, but I mean, one way to think about it is just driving more demand for storage. I think all the devices we carry have more and more capability to store higher definition video, which is just driving the need for more storage per device. So if you have something more specific than that, I'm happy to follow-up on and go... Smart video, the smart video market, I'm sorry, I misinterpreted. Smart video right in the HDD market. We see -- that market has been pretty stable. I think we see some improvement in it. But I mean, I don't think there's anything that's particularly noteworthy, except that it's a good market for us and continue to move forward. All right, everyone. Look, we really appreciate you spending time with us. We'll follow up with you throughout the quarter. And again, thanks for joining us. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the third fiscal quarter were above the upper end of the guidance ranges provided in January. Flash revenue and gross margin improvement were the primary contributors to the upside versus guidance. Total revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Looking at our end markets, client Devices revenue was $2 billion, down 6% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, client SSD revenue was flat and notebook and desktop PC hard drive revenue was down, though it decreased less than what we're used to seeing based on typical seasonality. Gaming revenue grew, while mobile revenue was down on a sequential basis. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Revenue was $1.2 billion, up 53% sequentially, but down 19% from a year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs grew sequentially. We were encouraged to see the sequential growth driven by our new energy-assisted hard drives at the 16- and 18-terabyte capacity points and our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD products, both targeted for the cloud and large-scale enterprise OEMs. Lastly, Client Solutions revenue was $888 million, down 12% sequentially and up 8% from a year ago. Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially on a blended basis and flat on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 7%, while the average price per hard drive increased 14% to $82. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the third quarter was 27.7%, up 1.3 percentage points sequentially. This was above the upper end of the guidance range provided in January. Continued success in driving down costs, coupled with an improving pricing environment and our ability to shift bits to more attractive end markets, drove our flash gross margin up 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 30.0%. Our hard drive gross margin was 25%, down 0.5 percentage points sequentially. As noted last quarter, production ramp costs of our new energy-assisted drives and a planned reduction in overall units shipped pressured gross margin. This also includes COVID-19-related impact of $31 million or approximately 1.6 percentage points. Operating expenses of $732 million were higher than guidance due to a larger-than-expected variable compensation accrual tied to our improved profitability. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal third quarter was 8%, which was well below our prior expectations and directly resulted in a $0.17 benefit to our earnings per share. We now expect our tax rate to be 17% for fiscal year 2021. Earnings per share was $1.02. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share was still well above guidance. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $116 million and free cash flow was negative $11 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was a cash outflow of $127 million. In the fiscal third quarter, we paid off $212 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million. We'll also be making an additional optional debt payment of $150 million this Friday, highlighting the confidence we have in our cash flow generation for the fourth quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage of 2.6x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes a $1 billion add-back of depreciation associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect both hard drive and flash revenue to be up sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect both flash and hard drive gross margin to improve sequentially as well. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $790 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $68 million and $73 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.60 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Now I'll turn it back over to Dave. And we're beginning to ramp our BiCS5 112-layer technology as well, which will continue to help bring the cost down. Well, gross margins were up in both -- I'm sorry, gross margins were up on the flash side. They're actually down sequentially. In the June quarter. Yes. Sequentially, will be up in both businesses, probably driven a little bit more on the flash side. And I think the costs will get better quarter-to-quarter as well. We slowed down production a little bit in the March quarter, and we're back at full production here in the June quarter. Yes. No, that's a good question. And we definitely are carrying a little more inventory than we normally would, particularly on the hard drive side because of the tightness on controllers. And also, frankly, because of the logistics costs associated with COVID-19, we're putting more products on the ocean and not in the air. So it's definitely having an impact in terms of working capital in that respect. Our accounts payable did go down this quarter. I mean that really was a result of a slowing down on the production in the March quarter, and I think it will come back up again this quarter. Yes. No, that's a good observation. And we expected CapEx to be around $3 billion this year, pretty much all year. The main delta is we actually sold some real estate this past quarter to the tune of about $100 million. Yes. So I don't think we heard quite all the beginning of your comment, but you're correct that the K1 period expenses are immaterial now. We've ramped there to normal volume levels, and so those costs are getting inventory. So it's -- I think we're kind of in a normal state. As New York fabs come on, it's not going to have as big an impact from a start-up cost standpoint as the greenfield that we did with K1. So definitely, you're bringing on some fixed costs, but we'll also be bringing production volumes up and amortizing those costs over a bigger base because we have multiple fabs on a given campus. I do taxes, and Dave didn't talk about video. So yes, and we -- this has come up in prior calls. I mean we've been in a situation over the last couple of years where our operating profits have been below what we expected. And we have minimum taxes that we have to pay around the world. And so our rate was higher than what we would consider normal the last couple of years. Now as we're forecasting the rest of this fiscal year with the profitability we're expecting, we're very confident in the rate of 17%. And it will be -- as we look to future years, it will be a function of how profitable we are in those years. But right now, I think a good planning number is 17%. Yes, it's a growing market. Yes. Thanks, everyone."

Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These results reflect continued growth in retail in what was a seasonally strong quarter. In addition, stronger demand for our client SSD products as well as our notebook and desktop hard drives contributed to upside in revenue. We continue to work hard delivering for our shareholders, customers, partners, and communities. We adapted to changes in our business and continue to manage the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our results reflect the benefits of having such a diverse and deep product portfolio, fantastic franchises, a vast customer base, and now an optimized organizational structure. As a result, we have a solid foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in front of us. I'm excited about the progress we've made over the last few months in the recently established Flash and HDD business units. Both franchises are led by exceptional leaders who are highly focused on executing their respective strategies by establishing their teams, evaluating technology and product development, engaging with customers, and analyzing and effectively capturing target end markets. As we've highlighted in previous earnings calls, we are committed to delivering on our product roadmap, including advancing our product transitions. Notably, we are making great headway with the product transitions of our energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs. As you all know, these transitions are multi-quarter journeys, but I'm pleased with our progress, which I'll detail shortly.\nBob Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were at/or above the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Revenue was $3.9 billion, up slightly sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Growth in Client Devices and Client Solutions was mostly offset by a decline in our Data Center Devices & Solutions end market. Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Work, school and game from home trends continue to drive demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions for notebook and desktop applications. In notebook and desktop, our flash and hard drive revenue each grew over 20% sequentially, highlighting the power and value of our portfolio for our leading OEM customers. Demand for our smart video hard drive was much stronger than expected, growing 30% sequentially as demand continued to recover from the bottom set in fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 during the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. And lastly, Mobile revenue was down sequentially, with growth in recently introduced 5G phones offset by dynamics within China. Moving on to Data Center Devices & Solutions, revenue was $807 million, down 29% sequentially and 46% from 1 year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs were down sequentially. As Dave mentioned, we had an unexpected delay in a qualification at a cloud titan. As a result, during the quarter, our capacity enterprise drive shipments were negatively impacted and inventory grew. We have since completed this qualification. And as Dave noted, given that a separate cloud titan qualification was completed ahead of schedule, we now have 3 of the 4 cloud titan qualified on our new energy-assisted drives. In addition, we are beginning to ramp our second-generation enterprise SSD products through calendar year 2021. Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $1 billion, up 19% sequentially and 6% from a year ago. The work, school and gaming from home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products, again, highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel. Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. As we discussed, Western Digital has worked hard to position ourselves to address this unabated growth in data and therefore, storage technology. And thanks to these efforts, the market has aligned favorably for us. We're running two industry-leading technology franchises in end markets that will only continue to grow as the digital transformation further accelerates. We know that our HDD business is less encumbered by workload mix shifts today and that our flash business is becoming more and more driven by applications. We also have made the right investments and our joint ventures with Kioxia are a strategic differentiating asset. It is an extremely exciting time for our company as we are focused on capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Accordingly, we will continue building momentum behind our business unit strategies, company positioning, strong brand and industry leading fully portfolio. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of on the nearline hard disk drive market, I know that you talked about some puts and takes with regard to qualification cycles on the 18-terabytes. But I guess the question first of all is can you help us understand what capacity shipments did in the quarter for nearline? And just help us understand the kind of the shape of the ramp that you expect on nearline as far as capacity shift over the next quarter, a couple of quarters, which \u2013 however, you want to kind of discuss your expectations on APTV's ramping going forward? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I would say -- thanks, Aaron. So, I would say the mix last quarter was still 14, 16 for the most part. Of course, there are some 18s mixed in there. But as we said, one of big calls that we were working on kind of finished right in the first week of the following quarter. So, we expect that now to start ramping. I think, as I said in the remarks, I think cloud digestion is abating. So, there -- I think the different big players come out of it at different rates. And the first ones are already starting to come out and we expect other ones to pick up as we go through the year. So, the big thing for us is we expect 18 to -- as we get into the middle part of the year, that's where the transition will happen at being the leading capacity point for us. And as that happens, that's good for our business. So, that's basically how we see it.\nAaron Rakers: And what did capacity shipments during the quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Bob, do you have the capacity shipment for the quarter?\nBob Eulau: Well, I mean, we don't split it out specifically, but you can see that on the Data Center Devices & Solutions, we were down quite a bit and that was driven both by the capacity enterprise as well as enterprise SSD.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you.\nBob Eulau: Sure.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Aaron.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Thanks for letting me ask the question. In terms of the NAND gross margins, the improvement that you saw in the December quarter sequentially with prices down 6% like-for-like and the improvement that you're seeing in Q1, where is that coming from? And can you remind us where you are with the start-up expenses from the new fab rolling off?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So, I'd say, kind of as we started talking about last quarter, in the more transactional markets, we're seeing pricing get better. We -- we'll see how that flows through to the negotiated markets over the next couple of quarters. But basically, as we went through the quarter, we saw retail and parts of the channel improve. And as far as K1 costs?\nBob Eulau: Yes, I can update you on K1. So, I think I had originally guided to around $50 million in K1 startup costs this quarter and we actually came in around $40 million. And this quarter, the quarter we're now in, will be at normal production volume. So, we're not going to continue reporting start-up costs because we're really not in start-up mode anymore.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of your inventory level, I think you said that the inventory increase was mostly on the drive side. Where are you in terms of your internal NAND inventory?\nBob Eulau: The flash inventory is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We're not -- we haven't really built inventory on the Flash side. We really, as we mentioned in our remarks, really build some inventory in anticipation of the new drive \u2013 the new capacity enterprise drives shipping, and that's going to start higher and higher volumes as we go forward.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thanks so much.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.\nBob Eulau: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hi, there.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the color on the data center side. I was wondering, just given your comments around the qualification timing, can this segment grow in fiscal second-half versus fiscal second-half of 2020, especially given that the comps sort of get tougher by the end of the fiscal year? And your comments on HDD gross margins sort of worsening sequentially, is this basically \u2013 are we waiting for one more quarter, basically the end of the fiscal year before we see HDD margins pick up as you get material pickup in AT&T? Or will these cloud sort of abatement plus the OEM pickup help by your fiscal fourth quarter? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. Let me see if I can decompose that a little bit. So yes, we expect a pickup in \u2013 as we move throughout the year. I think your call on the gross margin \u2013 we see the revenue coming back as we move into next quarter and then getting better throughout the year. We kind of guide one quarter at a time. I don't have the year-over-year number on the top of my head. But you're right on margin. We kind of expect one more quarter of maybe flat to slightly down margin on the drive side, and then we'll start to see that accelerate, especially as we move through into higher percentage of AT&Ts.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, Toshiya.\nToshiya Hari: Hey, thanks. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on gross margins in your ECD business, David. So again, as you mentioned, this quarter is going to be flat to down. As you move forward with mix improving, hopefully, COVID costs abating at some point, maybe some of the costs related to energy assist going away. Do you think getting back to 30% over the next year or so is a reasonable target? Or is the margin profile structurally different today versus a year ago, two years ago? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: No. I think you hit on the issues there. I mean, first of all, COVID hit last quarter was about 1.7% of a headwind in that business. In mix, we talked about retail being multi-year high. But we believe as we get \u2013 we go into 18, we have a path back to the kind of margin profile you're talking about. We just need to get the mix better. I mean COVID's a bit of a wildcard. How fast the \u2013 it's really the freight costs, how fast we can get freight costs to come down. It's been obviously pretty sticky about where it's been for the last couple of quarters. And then as I said, as we move into 18 and we see the cloud digest \u2013 fully come out of cloud digestion, I think, you'll see a path back to the more traditional margin structure.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. On the Flash side, can you please provide some color as to what percentage of flash revenue were driven from gaming? And how do you see that trending for the rest of the year? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Gaming is still -- I think it's not as significant as it was last quarter, given last quarter, there was a lot of buy in anticipation of the initial builds. So, I would say it's down a little bit sequentially, but it's still a great market for us because we can play the console side of it and the retail with WD Black, which has been very, very well-received in the retail channels. It is part of the reason, the retail business is doing well, and the margins are good as we're investing in brand in addition to just the product. So sequentially down a little bit, but still expected to be a good market as we move throughout the year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Gotcha. And then one additional follow-up on the flash side. Last earning conference call, you alluded to the fact that you are a couple of quarters away from finalizing contracts with OEMs and as prices or supply demand at Titans, do you see OEMs stepping up and signing longer term contracts, or is this just going to be a guesswork as to how they plan for, especially like one or two quarters out?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think what I talked about last quarter was actually a qualification at the OEMs and that's a multi-quarter activity. The pricing is negotiated on a quarterly basis, and there's a long-term agreement of, let's say, on a year timeframe of what the target share is, but that can move around a little bit. But that gives you a sense about how the market works.\nMehdi Hosseini: But how do you see the dynamics like today compared to like October conference call?\nDavid Goeckeler: Of which part, the call, or the share, or the pricing?\nMehdi Hosseini: Well, the qualification and how I think as you look into remainder of the year, do you see more of a pricing power coming back to the suppliers, or is it still going to be a hard negotiation?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean -- so the qualification was all about our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product, which is quite a mouthful. But that qualification -- I think last quarter, I said we were scheduled to start a qualification this quarter. I said in October, we were scheduled to start qualification in our fiscal second quarter, which did start and is underway. And that is a multi-quarter process. And assuming it's successful, put us in a stronger position to ship that product into the OEM -- into the big OEM. So it's underway. As I said in the prepared remarks, and I think I've been talking about now for a couple of quarters. The qualification in my book is the last phase of the development process. It can move around a little bit. But the fact that it's underway is a good sign for -- we're working to expand the TAM of that product.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. A question on the NAND side. Can you speak to what's driving the better than seasonal demand in Q1? And then beyond March, how are you thinking about changes in your mix? And what impact that will have on your gross margins? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: So I'll take -- I'll give you a perspective, and share Bob's perspective as well. So we've been talking about retail for several quarters now. It's been good. The team has been doing a great job launching new products. I talked about WD Black in the gaming segment, ArmorLock, security and enterprise SSD, so lot of really good work there. And so that continue -- we expect that there's momentum there, let me put it that way. PC, notebook demand, we still see as being strong. And we talked about what I think was a significant milestone for us this past quarter was finishing the qualification of our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product at one of the cloud titans. And that finished right at the end of the quarter and we started shipping. So that is -- that's accretive as well.\nBob Eulau: Yes. I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think it's -- retail continues to be strong in this work from home environment and the enterprise SSD business will just keep picking up.\nC.J. Muse: And just to follow-up on how you're thinking about mix beyond the current quarter and what the implications are for margins?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean, say a little more. I mean, we're still -- I mean, we still have a \u2013 I would say, we're focused on a balanced portfolio. I mean, we're clearly working on improving our position on enterprise SSD. That's been a big goal for the company for -- even before I got here. And our second-generation product is things are going well. I think 150 qualifications now, including one of the big cloud players, which is a good breakthrough. We're still \u2013 client SSD is obviously a strength for the company and has been for a while. We talked about gaming last quarter. And then mobile, we still have a healthy mix into mobile. I think we're under-indexed to the market, but we're still in that market because it's very, very important to be in that market. So I expect a balanced mix across that. And then mix in some IoT and automotive and you get most of the portfolio.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. The question I have is on NAND. It's good to see NAND margins improving and price decline moderating. How do you see industry supply-demand balance for the rest of the year maybe compared to what you think a quarter ago? And how do you see your own bit shipment growth this calendar year and kind of the shape of that for the rest of this year? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: I guess what we would say about investment in the industry is we're pretty much where we've been, which we think the industry has been pretty good about this. I mean, there's a lot of variability on investment on supplier by supplier, capital cycles vary, even no transitions within each supplier vary about how much capital require \u2013 how much capital is required. In our case, BiCS5 is a very capital-efficient node. BiCS6 will require a little more capital. We'll talk about that when we get there. So we still see a pretty good balance. We see strong demand drivers. We see I think we see bit growth this year, probably low 30s, low to mid-30s, and we see demand above that. So I think nothing we're seeing in the environment surprises us tremendously.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much. Dave, maybe qualitatively, now that you've been at the company for almost a year, without, I guess, financial quantification, with the two businesses now separated, where do you see the most improvement in the time that you've been here so far? Is it in the R&D side of things? Are you more efficient there, manufacturing supply chain? Where are you seeing the most gains? And where do you think, as you go into your second year, you see more opportunities to improve?\nDavid Goeckeler: So, I guess, what I would say is, first of all, it's been an extraordinary 10 months and especially to join the company at the beginning of a global pandemic that I don't -- that hasn't happened in our lifetimes, at least not mine. And so, I think, it's been -- it's just been extremely impressive to see how the company has responded to that. And the evolution of that in the early days, a lot of issues on the supply side that have just been completely worked out and things are running extremely well. I think we've made a lot of progress on the -- just what you said, really understanding where the synergies of this portfolio are, which are on the go-to-market side, the fact that we bring a broader solution to our customers. And I think we understand our customers' requirements well, given that we can play in both the drive market and the flash market, but that they're very different products. And driving the road maps up, I mean, the technology is extremely important and to separate those in the BU. And I think we -- we're -- it's still pretty early, but the impact of having two very accomplished leaders join an already strong team, it just has an immediate impact on clarifying the road map, understanding where we're investing our R&D dollars, engaging with customers in a way that can drive the portfolio. So I think we've made really good progress there, but I think it will continue to get better as we go when these leaders get -- and the groups get more established. And then the other thing I'll say, which is not really something that I expect to get better. I think it's something that I just always want to reinforce is, the value of the partnership with Kioxia. And I've spent -- given I can't travel, we still spend a lot of time with the leadership there. Obviously, our teams work together on a day-by-day basis. I'm not saying \u2013 I\u2019m not pointing this out because it works extraordinarily well, and it's just a tremendous strength of the company, and it's been really great for me to be a part of it over the last 10 months.\nPatrick Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, Mitch.\nMitch Steves: Hey. How are you doing, sir. I had two questions. I'm actually going to focus a little bit more on the hard disk drive side. So first is just kind of on the margins. If I look at the kind of the run rate of the business right now and I compared it to 2018, it was -- back then, it was kind of a 27% gross margin business on roughly $2 billion of revenue. So, if I assume that COVID-related headwinds and kind of the supply chain issues, or about 100 basis points of headwind to gross margin, am I roughly accurate there? So, I'll start with that one, I have a follow-up after that.\nBob Eulau: Yes, I think it's closer to 170 basis points of headwind.\nMitch Steves: So, the number would have been kind of 27.2, 27.3, in that rough range?\nBob Eulau: Yes. Yes, that's correct.\nMitch Steves: Okay. And then secondly, you guys used to disclose a little bit more detail on the non-compute units. I think those were up pretty significantly Q-over-Q, 8.2 going to 10.1. I'm just curious if you can give us any sort of like directionality in was it more consumer electronics or was it more your branded units are doing better for the quarter?\nBob Eulau: I don't want to get too much into the specifics. So, one of the things we did mention was smart video was up quite a bit sequentially and that's in the non-compute area. But we're just on the hard drive side, on client and notebook, we did really well.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\nTom O'Malley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is really centered around the transition of the two CloudTitans with the HD qualifications. You said one slipped a little, one came in a bit earlier. Can you talk about what the mix of those transitions kind of net? You talked about obviously, the gross margin slipping into the next quarter, but then kind of recovering. So, we're seeing a bottom there. Do you think that the out quarter is benefiting from this with the one coming in earlier, or do you think it's a negative transaction in the near-term? I just want to get a little bit more color about how it affects the business into March?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I think -- so if you look in last quarter, there was some business we expected to ship on 18 that we didn't because the qualification wasn't done and it actually wrapped up, I think, the first week of January. So, some of that business mixes into other capacity points and some of it goes to other suppliers. But -- and then in the other qualification that we didn't expect to finish until -- it wasn't -- we didn't -- and the schedule was the end of the -- towards the end of this quarter we're in. That actually finished sometime last quarter, very smooth. So, what it says is looking backwards that things could have been a little better if the one would have finished on time, but going -- now they're both behind us. So, going forward, we're in a position to start to ship 18s to both of those customers as they ramp the capacity point. Does that help?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking -- hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the gross margins on the flash side of the business, good to see the inflection in gross margins in December. As you guys mentioned, start-up costs are coming out here in the March quarter. So, that's about 150, 175 basis points gross margin tailwind to NAND. And then on top of that, you're seeing better pricing trends and maybe getting a little bit of benefit from the higher margin trends from your initial shipments of your Gen 2 NVMe products. So, are gross margins approaching 30% here in the March quarter, or maybe if you could just help me understand some of the puts and takes on gross margins for NAND.\nBob Eulau: Yes. So, Harlan, I mean, you talked about a number of the moving parts. And we're definitely, as I said earlier, expecting gross margins to improve on the flash side. We saw in the last quarter, I'd say, very -- good pricing trends in the transactional markets. The OEM markets, we negotiate one quarter a time. So it's \u2013 and we did that, obviously, in the middle of last quarter. So it's a little hard to say how much we'll see there. And then we're continuing to do a good job on the other part of the equation, which is cost reduction. We still think we're very confident in our 15% year-over-year cost decline. So I think it's just a question of how pricing plays out as we move forward. But I think we're in a very good place.\nHarlan Sur: Yes. Absolutely. And just a follow-up. So many of the suppliers of your HDD and SSD controller chips are seeing tightness in wafer supply, assembly and test capacity. Are your shipments here in the March quarter potentially being somewhat held back because of lack of controller availability from some of your merchant or ASIC controller chip suppliers?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, there's no doubt things are tight, and we're not immune from that. I mean, clearly, we have our financial plan covered with components. But when you do go looking for things from the semiconductor supply chain, it is tight right now. So we'll see how it plays out during the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNik Todorov: Yes. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I understand, David, I think you talked about seeing continued momentum in retail and PCs. But maybe we can extend a little bit. I would like to hear your thoughts about how you see those trends persisting as we look forward. I know visibility is probably not as good. But I just want to hear your thoughts, how you're thinking as we go into the following quarters, the demand from PCs and retail and work-from-home specifically?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, it's obviously a very dynamic environment with the pandemic and seeing resurgence in certain parts of the world and more lockdowns in parts of the world. So it's hard to call it more than one quarter a time. We guide one quarter at a time, but I think I understand your question a little bit broader. I guess what I would say is in retail, we've really just dialed in like how to deal with this environment we're in and the dynamic nature of it. And I think that the new products that we've been launching have been well received. Again, I mean the WD Black gaming product, we're doing co-branding with other folks. We introduced a product around security and storage that I think is going to be good for us. So a lot of investment in the brands, which are strong, make sure we keep share of voice high. And it has been an area where we've been able to get some momentum and keep some momentum, I think, going a couple of quarters back. So but it is, to your point, it's very dynamic given the COVID situation and the lockdown. So we'll see above seasonality performance. Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for retail, but we're planning to do a little bit better than that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hi, there.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, I guess if I could just go back to the gross margins on the flash side. Longer term, intermediate and a longer-term view, you guys see a path to sustainably greater than 30% margins. I think you've talked about it in the past. And if so, what are the kind of signpost or mechanisms that need to manifest to have that be the case? Appreciate it.\nBob Eulau: Yes. I guess, I can start with that. And again, as we all know, a lot of this depends on the supply and demand and what's going on with the industry. We've been encouraged, as we said about the pricing in the transactional markets over the last few months. As we move forward, we're pretty confident on the demand side for the year. I mean, there's just obviously a big demand on the mobile side. We think we're going to see very good demand on the enterprise SSDs. We've already had a strong position on client SSDs. So we feel pretty confident on the demand side. And we think the supply side appears to be pretty rational. And I think if that's the case, we should see margins improve from here. But I don't want to put a particular milestone or a particular goal out there, but I think it's going to be a pretty good market in 2021.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think we've been signaling that about 2021 for a couple of quarters now. Again, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do have more exposure to the transactional markets, which helps when things start going in a positive direction, but it's got to flow through to the negotiated market still, and we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters. The other thing I'll highlight on this is really important, and Bob touched on earlier, is just make sure we maintain our cost position. And as I've highlighted a couple of times in the prepared remarks and what I said earlier, with our partner, Kioxia, we're the largest provider of NAND flash memory in the industry. We jointly develop our technology road map. So we're heavily invested in that. We believe we've got tremendous technology that allows us to deliver the power performance bits we need. You see our technology is lower layer count than others. That means it's more efficient process. So we feel good about that; that sets us up to continue to drive the 15% year-over-year cost declines. So we got to make sure we keep our eye on that side of the equation as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup Investments.\nBob Eulau: Hey, Jim.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Hello. And you have implemented a more tightly focused on your two different segments, the flash and HDD segment, and kind of have been out for a little bit now. Have they -- those leaders done the work to where we're actually seeing the fruit of all their efforts now, or are they still implementing a lot of those and the fruit still have to be rolled out of their efforts, because it seems like prior to this, Western Digital has been very much known for a company that sometimes executes very well and other times has a few slip-ups. So I'm just trying to figure out, are we at the mid-point of them implementing all their changes in the early innings? Are we actually at the point now where what they found and discovered and wanted to align that we should expect going forward? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Jim, I think that -- so first of all, I think we see benefits of -- any time you add to leaders to your business that are run multi $10 billion portfolios in the technology space, you're going to get an immediate benefit from that. You just have two more very, very senior business leaders that are looking at the portfolio every day, that are engaging with customers every day, reviewing engineering products every day and providing a level of perspective that is highly developed and their main job is to integrate all the different pieces together into a business. So you're going to see an immediate benefit of that, and we have. But then they're going to start working on, okay, I'm going to start looking at the roadmap of our products and make sure I've got the right fit. I'm investing in the right places. To me, your technology roadmap is kind of like an articulation of the future value of your company. What markets are you going to be in? Where are you going to invest? And the timeline for those payouts are different -- there's different time horizons to that. So if you come into a technology franchise and you own it and you're in the middle of a big engagement with a customer, for example, you now have another person that can get involved in that process and understands immediately how to engage in that in a very senior way, how to communicate information, how to guide their teams and so I think you'll see an immediate benefit. There's other parts of it where we're making decisions on what products are going to come to market in 2 years from now or 3 years from now. And so their job is to really integrate over all of those time horizons and get the best results, given the investment we put in the business. So we've seen benefits already. But there will be more to come. And I think you will see crisper execution, and you'll see that the portfolio is optimized to give us the best return for the investment we're making.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, good afternoon. Gentlemen thank you for letting me ask the question. Hi. I had a question just on, I guess, your Hard Drive business. Your peer spoke about a recovery in data center in the first half of the year. And I'm curious if that resonates with you such that you could achieve 35% ex by growth for your nearline business in fiscal 2021 And I was also hoping you could juxtapose what you're seeing across on-prem and cloud within that nearline business? And then I guess, thirdly, if I may, I was hoping if you can achieve that 35% x by growth, can you do that with your existing capacity today or if you could touch on your capacity expansion plans as well? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: So I think your first part of the question was about what are we seeing when you say enterprise on-prem market. So...\nKarl Ackerman: Nearline, specifically.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, nearline. I would say it's -- I think the term I used in the prepared remarks was stabilization of the enterprise of the OEM market. And I think that's kind of how we're seeing it. It's on or above forecast of what our customers are telling us. So it looks better. I wouldn't -- it's certainly not pre COVID yet. And it's easier to judge going forward, but not back to where it was. And that's not surprising given the environment we're in. As far as the cloud, we talked about different cloud providers come out of digesting at different rates throughout the year. And then as far as exabyte growth, we see that 32%, 35% in that range, exabyte growth. I think that's been the long-term growth of the industry. We see that going forward. Again, I think coming out of the pandemic, we'll see does that line tilt up or not, given the dependence on technology in the cloud that we all see, but we have yet see that. So we see good growth in the capacity enterprise business as we move through the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, guys. First, I have a clarification for Bob. Bob, on the client devices growing 10%. You said the desktop and notebook grew 20% and video grew 30%, and there was an issue in China. Just trying to understand what that was in mobile in China that you are referring to.\nBob Eulau: Yes. It was actually Huawei, which we talked about last quarter. And so, we're not shipping to Huawei either, on the flash side or on the hard drive side.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I just had a question on CapEx. It seems as if you've shifted a little bit more, I think, from cash CapEx into the flash ventures. And I'm just curious, how we should think about that, if there's anything there? And then also, what are your thoughts on the amount of CapEx that's going to be needed over the next few years as you look at, hopefully, an improving market? Thank you.\nBob Eulau: Yes. No, it's a good question. And first of all, what I would say is in terms of gross CapEx, which we define as the -- our portion of the investments that are made in the flash joint ventures, as well as investments we make on our own balance sheet for the back end of the Flash business as well as the Hard Drive business. We expect gross CapEx of around $3 billion this year, and that's been -- what I've said the last couple of quarters. What's a little different this year relative to last year is that we are investing more on the hard drive side. As we look out over the next few years, I mean the first priority is always going to be reinvest in the business. And so, we'll see how the growth goes over the next few years and make sure that we're investing to support the growth in the market. But I think probably where we\u2019re at right now is about what I would think about for the future.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you just maybe broadly talk about your thinking around edge cloud compute for 2021? It seems like based on what the service providers are talking about, that this could be a year where it starts to pick up noticeably. And so, where do you think you're going to play with NVMe drives versus HDDS? And how you think you're positioned competitively? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think, that's potentially a very deep conversation. So how are we positioned? I think we're positioned actually quite well, because we can play in -- if it's a lot of the heavy lifting of big time storage is HDDs and will be for a long time. But obviously, enterprise SSD is going to be a big growing market there as well. And that's why we're so focused on our NVMe enterprise SSD. As far as how the architecture of the cloud plays out, I mean, clearly, as we have more devices that are enabled at the edge, I think you're going to see more points of compute and storage that get closer to that. I agree with you, this could be -- it could be getting closer. It's been talked about for a while. But I think this is something that's so exciting about our business. I mean, the whole world is more technology-enabled. I think the pandemic accelerated that. I think the architectures to support that are going to continue to evolve. And I think we have the portfolio that's well positioned, no matter how that plays out. We can play on the edge, all the way to the device. And clearly, we play at the foundation of the cloud as well. So, it's a fun place to be.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Dave Goeckeler, for any closing remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate it. We will see you during the quarter. Take care.\nBob Eulau: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These results reflect continued growth in retail in what was a seasonally strong quarter. In addition, stronger demand for our client SSD products as well as our notebook and desktop hard drives contributed to upside in revenue. We continue to work hard delivering for our shareholders, customers, partners, and communities. We adapted to changes in our business and continue to manage the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our results reflect the benefits of having such a diverse and deep product portfolio, fantastic franchises, a vast customer base, and now an optimized organizational structure. As a result, we have a solid foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in front of us. I'm excited about the progress we've made over the last few months in the recently established Flash and HDD business units. Both franchises are led by exceptional leaders who are highly focused on executing their respective strategies by establishing their teams, evaluating technology and product development, engaging with customers, and analyzing and effectively capturing target end markets. As we've highlighted in previous earnings calls, we are committed to delivering on our product roadmap, including advancing our product transitions. Notably, we are making great headway with the product transitions of our energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs. As you all know, these transitions are multi-quarter journeys, but I'm pleased with our progress, which I'll detail shortly. Thanks, Bob. As we discussed, Western Digital has worked hard to position ourselves to address this unabated growth in data and therefore, storage technology. And thanks to these efforts, the market has aligned favorably for us. We're running two industry-leading technology franchises in end markets that will only continue to grow as the digital transformation further accelerates. We know that our HDD business is less encumbered by workload mix shifts today and that our flash business is becoming more and more driven by applications. We also have made the right investments and our joint ventures with Kioxia are a strategic differentiating asset. It is an extremely exciting time for our company as we are focused on capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Accordingly, we will continue building momentum behind our business unit strategies, company positioning, strong brand and industry leading fully portfolio. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes, I would say -- thanks, Aaron. So, I would say the mix last quarter was still 14, 16 for the most part. Of course, there are some 18s mixed in there. But as we said, one of big calls that we were working on kind of finished right in the first week of the following quarter. So, we expect that now to start ramping. I think, as I said in the remarks, I think cloud digestion is abating. So, there -- I think the different big players come out of it at different rates. And the first ones are already starting to come out and we expect other ones to pick up as we go through the year. So, the big thing for us is we expect 18 to -- as we get into the middle part of the year, that's where the transition will happen at being the leading capacity point for us. And as that happens, that's good for our business. So, that's basically how we see it. Bob, do you have the capacity shipment for the quarter? Thanks, Aaron. Hey, Joe. Yes. So, I'd say, kind of as we started talking about last quarter, in the more transactional markets, we're seeing pricing get better. We -- we'll see how that flows through to the negotiated markets over the next couple of quarters. But basically, as we went through the quarter, we saw retail and parts of the channel improve. And as far as K1 costs? Thanks, Joe. Hi, there. Okay. Let me see if I can decompose that a little bit. So yes, we expect a pickup in \u2013 as we move throughout the year. I think your call on the gross margin \u2013 we see the revenue coming back as we move into next quarter and then getting better throughout the year. We kind of guide one quarter at a time. I don't have the year-over-year number on the top of my head. But you're right on margin. We kind of expect one more quarter of maybe flat to slightly down margin on the drive side, and then we'll start to see that accelerate, especially as we move through into higher percentage of AT&Ts. Hey, Toshiya. No. I think you hit on the issues there. I mean, first of all, COVID hit last quarter was about 1.7% of a headwind in that business. In mix, we talked about retail being multi-year high. But we believe as we get \u2013 we go into 18, we have a path back to the kind of margin profile you're talking about. We just need to get the mix better. I mean COVID's a bit of a wildcard. How fast the \u2013 it's really the freight costs, how fast we can get freight costs to come down. It's been obviously pretty sticky about where it's been for the last couple of quarters. And then as I said, as we move into 18 and we see the cloud digest \u2013 fully come out of cloud digestion, I think, you'll see a path back to the more traditional margin structure. Yes. Gaming is still -- I think it's not as significant as it was last quarter, given last quarter, there was a lot of buy in anticipation of the initial builds. So, I would say it's down a little bit sequentially, but it's still a great market for us because we can play the console side of it and the retail with WD Black, which has been very, very well-received in the retail channels. It is part of the reason, the retail business is doing well, and the margins are good as we're investing in brand in addition to just the product. So sequentially down a little bit, but still expected to be a good market as we move throughout the year. Yes. I think what I talked about last quarter was actually a qualification at the OEMs and that's a multi-quarter activity. The pricing is negotiated on a quarterly basis, and there's a long-term agreement of, let's say, on a year timeframe of what the target share is, but that can move around a little bit. But that gives you a sense about how the market works. Of which part, the call, or the share, or the pricing? Well, I mean -- so the qualification was all about our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product, which is quite a mouthful. But that qualification -- I think last quarter, I said we were scheduled to start a qualification this quarter. I said in October, we were scheduled to start qualification in our fiscal second quarter, which did start and is underway. And that is a multi-quarter process. And assuming it's successful, put us in a stronger position to ship that product into the OEM -- into the big OEM. So it's underway. As I said in the prepared remarks, and I think I've been talking about now for a couple of quarters. The qualification in my book is the last phase of the development process. It can move around a little bit. But the fact that it's underway is a good sign for -- we're working to expand the TAM of that product. So I'll take -- I'll give you a perspective, and share Bob's perspective as well. So we've been talking about retail for several quarters now. It's been good. The team has been doing a great job launching new products. I talked about WD Black in the gaming segment, ArmorLock, security and enterprise SSD, so lot of really good work there. And so that continue -- we expect that there's momentum there, let me put it that way. PC, notebook demand, we still see as being strong. And we talked about what I think was a significant milestone for us this past quarter was finishing the qualification of our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product at one of the cloud titans. And that finished right at the end of the quarter and we started shipping. So that is -- that's accretive as well. Well, I mean, say a little more. I mean, we're still -- I mean, we still have a \u2013 I would say, we're focused on a balanced portfolio. I mean, we're clearly working on improving our position on enterprise SSD. That's been a big goal for the company for -- even before I got here. And our second-generation product is things are going well. I think 150 qualifications now, including one of the big cloud players, which is a good breakthrough. We're still \u2013 client SSD is obviously a strength for the company and has been for a while. We talked about gaming last quarter. And then mobile, we still have a healthy mix into mobile. I think we're under-indexed to the market, but we're still in that market because it's very, very important to be in that market. So I expect a balanced mix across that. And then mix in some IoT and automotive and you get most of the portfolio. I guess what we would say about investment in the industry is we're pretty much where we've been, which we think the industry has been pretty good about this. I mean, there's a lot of variability on investment on supplier by supplier, capital cycles vary, even no transitions within each supplier vary about how much capital require \u2013 how much capital is required. In our case, BiCS5 is a very capital-efficient node. BiCS6 will require a little more capital. We'll talk about that when we get there. So we still see a pretty good balance. We see strong demand drivers. We see I think we see bit growth this year, probably low 30s, low to mid-30s, and we see demand above that. So I think nothing we're seeing in the environment surprises us tremendously. So, I guess, what I would say is, first of all, it's been an extraordinary 10 months and especially to join the company at the beginning of a global pandemic that I don't -- that hasn't happened in our lifetimes, at least not mine. And so, I think, it's been -- it's just been extremely impressive to see how the company has responded to that. And the evolution of that in the early days, a lot of issues on the supply side that have just been completely worked out and things are running extremely well. I think we've made a lot of progress on the -- just what you said, really understanding where the synergies of this portfolio are, which are on the go-to-market side, the fact that we bring a broader solution to our customers. And I think we understand our customers' requirements well, given that we can play in both the drive market and the flash market, but that they're very different products. And driving the road maps up, I mean, the technology is extremely important and to separate those in the BU. And I think we -- we're -- it's still pretty early, but the impact of having two very accomplished leaders join an already strong team, it just has an immediate impact on clarifying the road map, understanding where we're investing our R&D dollars, engaging with customers in a way that can drive the portfolio. So I think we've made really good progress there, but I think it will continue to get better as we go when these leaders get -- and the groups get more established. And then the other thing I'll say, which is not really something that I expect to get better. I think it's something that I just always want to reinforce is, the value of the partnership with Kioxia. And I've spent -- given I can't travel, we still spend a lot of time with the leadership there. Obviously, our teams work together on a day-by-day basis. I'm not saying \u2013 I'm not pointing this out because it works extraordinarily well, and it's just a tremendous strength of the company, and it's been really great for me to be a part of it over the last 10 months. Hey, Mitch. Yes, I think -- so if you look in last quarter, there was some business we expected to ship on 18 that we didn't because the qualification wasn't done and it actually wrapped up, I think, the first week of January. So, some of that business mixes into other capacity points and some of it goes to other suppliers. But -- and then in the other qualification that we didn't expect to finish until -- it wasn't -- we didn't -- and the schedule was the end of the -- towards the end of this quarter we're in. That actually finished sometime last quarter, very smooth. So, what it says is looking backwards that things could have been a little better if the one would have finished on time, but going -- now they're both behind us. So, going forward, we're in a position to start to ship 18s to both of those customers as they ramp the capacity point. Does that help? Yes, there's no doubt things are tight, and we're not immune from that. I mean, clearly, we have our financial plan covered with components. But when you do go looking for things from the semiconductor supply chain, it is tight right now. So we'll see how it plays out during the quarter. Yes. I mean, it's obviously a very dynamic environment with the pandemic and seeing resurgence in certain parts of the world and more lockdowns in parts of the world. So it's hard to call it more than one quarter a time. We guide one quarter at a time, but I think I understand your question a little bit broader. I guess what I would say is in retail, we've really just dialed in like how to deal with this environment we're in and the dynamic nature of it. And I think that the new products that we've been launching have been well received. Again, I mean the WD Black gaming product, we're doing co-branding with other folks. We introduced a product around security and storage that I think is going to be good for us. So a lot of investment in the brands, which are strong, make sure we keep share of voice high. And it has been an area where we've been able to get some momentum and keep some momentum, I think, going a couple of quarters back. So but it is, to your point, it's very dynamic given the COVID situation and the lockdown. So we'll see above seasonality performance. Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for retail, but we're planning to do a little bit better than that. Hi, there. Yes. I think we've been signaling that about 2021 for a couple of quarters now. Again, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do have more exposure to the transactional markets, which helps when things start going in a positive direction, but it's got to flow through to the negotiated market still, and we'll see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters. The other thing I'll highlight on this is really important, and Bob touched on earlier, is just make sure we maintain our cost position. And as I've highlighted a couple of times in the prepared remarks and what I said earlier, with our partner, Kioxia, we're the largest provider of NAND flash memory in the industry. We jointly develop our technology road map. So we're heavily invested in that. We believe we've got tremendous technology that allows us to deliver the power performance bits we need. You see our technology is lower layer count than others. That means it's more efficient process. So we feel good about that; that sets us up to continue to drive the 15% year-over-year cost declines. So we got to make sure we keep our eye on that side of the equation as well. Yes, Jim, I think that -- so first of all, I think we see benefits of -- any time you add to leaders to your business that are run multi $10 billion portfolios in the technology space, you're going to get an immediate benefit from that. You just have two more very, very senior business leaders that are looking at the portfolio every day, that are engaging with customers every day, reviewing engineering products every day and providing a level of perspective that is highly developed and their main job is to integrate all the different pieces together into a business. So you're going to see an immediate benefit of that, and we have. But then they're going to start working on, okay, I'm going to start looking at the roadmap of our products and make sure I've got the right fit. I'm investing in the right places. To me, your technology roadmap is kind of like an articulation of the future value of your company. What markets are you going to be in? Where are you going to invest? And the timeline for those payouts are different -- there's different time horizons to that. So if you come into a technology franchise and you own it and you're in the middle of a big engagement with a customer, for example, you now have another person that can get involved in that process and understands immediately how to engage in that in a very senior way, how to communicate information, how to guide their teams and so I think you'll see an immediate benefit. There's other parts of it where we're making decisions on what products are going to come to market in 2 years from now or 3 years from now. And so their job is to really integrate over all of those time horizons and get the best results, given the investment we put in the business. So we've seen benefits already. But there will be more to come. And I think you will see crisper execution, and you'll see that the portfolio is optimized to give us the best return for the investment we're making. So I think your first part of the question was about what are we seeing when you say enterprise on-prem market. So... Yes, nearline. I would say it's -- I think the term I used in the prepared remarks was stabilization of the enterprise of the OEM market. And I think that's kind of how we're seeing it. It's on or above forecast of what our customers are telling us. So it looks better. I wouldn't -- it's certainly not pre COVID yet. And it's easier to judge going forward, but not back to where it was. And that's not surprising given the environment we're in. As far as the cloud, we talked about different cloud providers come out of digesting at different rates throughout the year. And then as far as exabyte growth, we see that 32%, 35% in that range, exabyte growth. I think that's been the long-term growth of the industry. We see that going forward. Again, I think coming out of the pandemic, we'll see does that line tilt up or not, given the dependence on technology in the cloud that we all see, but we have yet see that. So we see good growth in the capacity enterprise business as we move through the year. Yes. I mean, I think, that's potentially a very deep conversation. So how are we positioned? I think we're positioned actually quite well, because we can play in -- if it's a lot of the heavy lifting of big time storage is HDDs and will be for a long time. But obviously, enterprise SSD is going to be a big growing market there as well. And that's why we're so focused on our NVMe enterprise SSD. As far as how the architecture of the cloud plays out, I mean, clearly, as we have more devices that are enabled at the edge, I think you're going to see more points of compute and storage that get closer to that. I agree with you, this could be -- it could be getting closer. It's been talked about for a while. But I think this is something that's so exciting about our business. I mean, the whole world is more technology-enabled. I think the pandemic accelerated that. I think the architectures to support that are going to continue to evolve. And I think we have the portfolio that's well positioned, no matter how that plays out. We can play on the edge, all the way to the device. And clearly, we play at the foundation of the cloud as well. So, it's a fun place to be. All right, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate it. We will see you during the quarter. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were at/or above the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Revenue was $3.9 billion, up slightly sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Growth in Client Devices and Client Solutions was mostly offset by a decline in our Data Center Devices & Solutions end market. Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Work, school and game from home trends continue to drive demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions for notebook and desktop applications. In notebook and desktop, our flash and hard drive revenue each grew over 20% sequentially, highlighting the power and value of our portfolio for our leading OEM customers. Demand for our smart video hard drive was much stronger than expected, growing 30% sequentially as demand continued to recover from the bottom set in fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 during the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. And lastly, Mobile revenue was down sequentially, with growth in recently introduced 5G phones offset by dynamics within China. Moving on to Data Center Devices & Solutions, revenue was $807 million, down 29% sequentially and 46% from 1 year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs were down sequentially. As Dave mentioned, we had an unexpected delay in a qualification at a cloud titan. As a result, during the quarter, our capacity enterprise drive shipments were negatively impacted and inventory grew. We have since completed this qualification. And as Dave noted, given that a separate cloud titan qualification was completed ahead of schedule, we now have 3 of the 4 cloud titan qualified on our new energy-assisted drives. In addition, we are beginning to ramp our second-generation enterprise SSD products through calendar year 2021. Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $1 billion, up 19% sequentially and 6% from a year ago. The work, school and gaming from home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products, again, highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel. Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. Well, I mean, we don't split it out specifically, but you can see that on the Data Center Devices & Solutions, we were down quite a bit and that was driven both by the capacity enterprise as well as enterprise SSD. Sure. Yes, I can update you on K1. So, I think I had originally guided to around $50 million in K1 startup costs this quarter and we actually came in around $40 million. And this quarter, the quarter we're now in, will be at normal production volume. So, we're not going to continue reporting start-up costs because we're really not in start-up mode anymore. The flash inventory is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We're not -- we haven't really built inventory on the Flash side. We really, as we mentioned in our remarks, really build some inventory in anticipation of the new drive \u2013 the new capacity enterprise drives shipping, and that's going to start higher and higher volumes as we go forward. Thanks. Yes. I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think it's -- retail continues to be strong in this work from home environment and the enterprise SSD business will just keep picking up. Yes, I think it's closer to 170 basis points of headwind. Yes. Yes, that's correct. I don't want to get too much into the specifics. So, one of the things we did mention was smart video was up quite a bit sequentially and that's in the non-compute area. But we're just on the hard drive side, on client and notebook, we did really well. Yes. So, Harlan, I mean, you talked about a number of the moving parts. And we're definitely, as I said earlier, expecting gross margins to improve on the flash side. We saw in the last quarter, I'd say, very -- good pricing trends in the transactional markets. The OEM markets, we negotiate one quarter a time. So it's \u2013 and we did that, obviously, in the middle of last quarter. So it's a little hard to say how much we'll see there. And then we're continuing to do a good job on the other part of the equation, which is cost reduction. We still think we're very confident in our 15% year-over-year cost decline. So I think it's just a question of how pricing plays out as we move forward. But I think we're in a very good place. Yes. I guess, I can start with that. And again, as we all know, a lot of this depends on the supply and demand and what's going on with the industry. We've been encouraged, as we said about the pricing in the transactional markets over the last few months. As we move forward, we're pretty confident on the demand side for the year. I mean, there's just obviously a big demand on the mobile side. We think we're going to see very good demand on the enterprise SSDs. We've already had a strong position on client SSDs. So we feel pretty confident on the demand side. And we think the supply side appears to be pretty rational. And I think if that's the case, we should see margins improve from here. But I don't want to put a particular milestone or a particular goal out there, but I think it's going to be a pretty good market in 2021. Hey, Jim. Yes. It was actually Huawei, which we talked about last quarter. And so, we're not shipping to Huawei either, on the flash side or on the hard drive side. Yes. No, it's a good question. And first of all, what I would say is in terms of gross CapEx, which we define as the -- our portion of the investments that are made in the flash joint ventures, as well as investments we make on our own balance sheet for the back end of the Flash business as well as the Hard Drive business. We expect gross CapEx of around $3 billion this year, and that's been -- what I've said the last couple of quarters. What's a little different this year relative to last year is that we are investing more on the hard drive side. As we look out over the next few years, I mean the first priority is always going to be reinvest in the business. And so, we'll see how the growth goes over the next few years and make sure that we're investing to support the growth in the market. But I think probably where we're at right now is about what I would think about for the future. All right. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy and safe. As I reflect on my first full quarter as CEO of Western Digital, I am extremely proud of the way our team has navigated the complexities of uncertainties inherent in this unprecedented environment. As a company, we continue to adapt to provide continuity and high-quality products for our customers, deliver value to our shareholders and, importantly, prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We have a unique view into many drivers and trends that play both domestically and internationally due to the breadth of our portfolio of innovative flash and hard drive solutions going into cloud, OEM channel and retail end markets. We look at our business holistically, but it is especially important now to understand the nuances, challenges and opportunities in each market we serve. So before we dig into the results for the quarter and full year, I want to talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro trends are impacting the business. I'll then update you on how we are thinking about our strategic priorities for the fiscal year 2021, before turning it over to Bob for a financial update, which will be followed by Q&A. Western Digital has successfully managed through this unpredictable time with limited business impact from the pandemic. We made important investments and changes to minimize manufacturing and logistical challenges that were primarily impacting our hard drive business. Bob will discuss the financial impact of these later in the call. And we have maintained our focus on delivering for customers throughout. From an end market standpoint, demand was mixed in the quarter. And if there's a common theme among our end markets, it's uncertainty. In the second half of fiscal 2020, customers were focused on ensuring they had enough supply to meet heightened demand. As expected, demand in our cloud business was strong, due to the work-from-home trend. At the same time, healthy demand for our flash-based notebook solutions drove record revenue in our OEM end market. Finally, in retail, while we have a robust distribution channel with over 350,000 points of purchase around the world in well-established brands; we were impacted by COVID-related lockdowns at many of our brick-and-mortar customers. We did see the business recover as the quarter progressed due to easing of lockdowns and the transition to online buying with curbside pickup. As we look to the first half of fiscal 2020, one, uncertainty remains. We remain vigilant given the resurgence of the virus and its potential to disrupt our supply chain, including our ability to keep full teams working in our manufacturing facilities. Apart from COVID-19, we're managing through other macro trends. The global economic contraction is generally -- is generating an uncertain demand environment, and we are closely monitoring trade-related geopolitical developments, which are pertinent to a global business like ours. These near-term headwinds will eventually subside, and we are confident that the strength of our portfolio and strong customer relationships customer relationships are well-aligned to where the growth is, in the cloud and on the edge. We've continued to make strategic technology and product investments in both flash and hard drives to drive long-term revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Now turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, results were generally in line with our guidance. We achieved this while partially offsetting higher than anticipated COVID-19 related costs, which Bob will discuss in more detail. We reported revenue of $4.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, mainly driven by growth in the cloud and record results for our client SSD portfolio for notebooks. Looking back at the full fiscal year 2020, I am pleased with our performance. Our end market diversity and breadth, broad customer base, channel reach and innovative leadership all position Western Digital to benefit from the multiyear growth in data creation and storage. For fiscal 2020, revenue totaled $16.7 billion and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.04. We continue to align our portfolio with a sharp focus on growth and margin improvement. Importantly, over the last year, we brought to market several exciting new innovations across both flash and hard drives that I'd like to touch upon. Starting with flash, as you know, we believe flash is the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital and is an area where we've already had a tremendous foundation with consumer cards, USB drives and client and enterprise SSDs. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, the migration to flash within game consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that underpins a multiyear growth opportunity. To capitalize on this opportunity, we launched BiCS5, our 112-layer flash product in retail last quarter, which delivers exceptional capacity, performance and reliability, all at an attractive cost. The ramp has gone very well with impressive yields and we are just at the beginning stages of this product ramp. While we focus on ramping BiCS5, BiCS4 has continued to provide the right balance of performance and cost reduction. BiCS4 represented over 60% of bits shipped in the quarter. Earlier this year, we celebrated the first production wafer shipment from our K1 fab, our new manufacturing facility for 3D BiCS flash memory. This is another important milestone reflecting the successful 20-year partnership we've had with Kioxia. Another major highlight has been the ramp of our Enterprise SSD product line. Enterprise SSD revenue in the quarter grew nearly 70% sequentially and our revenue share increased to the low double digits. This will remain an important area of focus within our flash portfolio. Now turning to hard drives, we continue to lead the industry in aerial density using innovations across the entire drive, algorithms, firmware, mechanical, heads and media. We were the first in the industry to ship energy-assisted drives for mass production and expect a strong ramp into the fiscal second quarter and beyond. In short, we are going through important product transitions in both our flash and HDD businesses that we think set up Western Digital well for the future. Recognizing that these are uncertain times, we believe that the most important thing we can do is keep our foot on the proverbial innovation pedal and execute on the road map across the business. We have an extremely talented team working on new products that will continue to drive leadership in flash and hard drives. Looking ahead, our strategic priorities are centered around driving innovation for customers and value for shareholders. First and foremost, we will focus on driving long-term shareholder value as we bolster our flash and HDD portfolios, including ramping two important product lines to high volume, our SSD products and our energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives. Secondly, we will accelerate our transition to BiCS5 delivering additional performance for our customers and notable cost advantages for Western Digital. Third, we will continue to sharpen our execution from a product road map and strategic business objectives. And finally, we are evolving our portfolio to drive growth, margin improvement and cash generation, while also paying down debt and investing in the future. In the near term, we expect to remain challenged by the pandemic in the global economic contraction. Internally, we're also navigating multiple substantial product transitions, which will require sharp execution focus, but we are very confident they will set us up well for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to share our financial highlights and outlook.\nBob Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a challenging global economy that has continued to impact Western Digital's performance, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty that both we and our customers are facing. While this uncertainty isn't going away in the near term, we'll continue to adapt, and we believe Western Digital is well positioned for the future. With that, I'll walk you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 18% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.7 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2019 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.04. Looking at end market, Client Devices revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5% on a sequential basis and up 19% year-over-year. Within this end market, our robust family of client SSDs, which are ideally suited for remote learning and work from home applications, achieved another record quarter of revenue. Notebook and desktop related hard drive revenue declined slightly sequentially as the market continued to transition to SSD-based products. Smart video was weaker than our expectations due to continued headwinds associated with the pandemic. In Gaming, we began shipping our flash solutions for the upcoming new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue was down sequentially, but up year-over-year, off a low base. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, revenue of $6.2 billion was up 24% from fiscal year 2019. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was down slightly on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew nearly 70% sequentially and more than doubled from a year ago. Next, Client Solutions revenue was $687 million, down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year due to COVID-19 related lockdowns. Despite this, we were encouraged to see demand pick up in June, as countries began to ease lockdown restrictions and as brick-and-mortar locations shifted more of their operations online. This strength continued into July. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we executed very well in this business in a difficult environment. With over 350,000 points of purchase around the world, we continue to have incredibly strong distribution breadth brand recognition. Turning to revenue by product category. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 49% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 1% sequentially on a blended basis and up 3% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Total exabyte shipments were down 2%. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 2% to $87 as mix continued to shift to the cloud. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 1 percentage point sequentially to 28.9%, slightly below our guidance range. The major item that impacted our gross margin was COVID-19 related costs of $96 million. This almost exclusively impacted hard drive -- the hard drive business and was primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics costs. For clarity, this item was included in our non-GAAP gross margin. Our Flash gross margin was 30.5%, up 4 percentage points from last quarter due to cost reductions and slightly favorable pricing. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The biggest driver of the lower gross margin was the $96 million in COVID-19 related costs, representing a 4.7 percentage point impact on our hard drive gross margin. Operating expenses were $713 million, well below our guidance range, primarily due to our decision to cap variable compensation expense given the current economic environment. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $172 million and free cash flow was $261 million. In fiscal 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and activity-related to Flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $89 million due to the timing of funds flowing to and from the joint ventures. In the fourth quarter, we distributed $150 million in dividends to our shareholders, which was our final distribution prior to suspending the dividend. We also made a standard $63 million debt repayment in the fourth quarter. I would note that we have already made an optional debt repayment of $150 million in July. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.7 billion. Our debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.2 times in the fourth quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.8 times. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes an approximate $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures, which is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We are somewhat challenged in the near-term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic and being in the midst of a global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and focus on our great products, deep customer relationships, and large and growing markets. We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long-term. We expect revenue in the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of $3.70 billion to $3.9 billion. Growth in Client Solutions is expected to be more than offset by a decline in both Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Devices. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25% and 27%. This range includes approximately $80 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. This should be the peak quarter in fiscal 2021 for K1 period expenses. We expect operating expenses to be between $700 million and $720 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $70 million and $80 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 26% in Q1 and for the full fiscal year 2021. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.65 in Q1, assuming approximately 304 million fully diluted shares. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our includes portion of the joint venture, leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures. We will continue to monitor capital expenditures very closely given the current business environment. In summary, we are executing well in a challenging environment and results are generally in line with expectations. We are taking decisive steps to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment, while ensuring we focus our resources to address the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead. I'll now turn it back over to Dave.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. While we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment, I'm confident that Western Digital can lead the market for years to come. As I've said, I came here because I have a very strong conviction that Western Digital can play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation, and that conviction has only strengthened in the past five months. We have deep flash and HDD product portfolio, operational scale and great customer relationships, combined with the ever-growing demand for data creation and storage. All in all, it's a great place to be, and I'm extremely thankful for the hard work that our talented global team puts in on a day-in and day-out basis. We're operating in uncertain times, but Western Digital's strong consistent performance reflects our ability to maintain our market leadership, by delivering technological innovation with the quality, performance and cost effectiveness that our customers rely upon. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could give us some sense on your 18-terabyte ramp. It appeared that you were expecting that ramp before in the September quarter. It looks like it might have been pushed out further. Can you talk about what's going on there? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. No, it hasn't pushed out. The ramp is on plan, as we've talked about. We plan on producing in excess of 1 million units this quarter. It's a very important quarter for us on that ramp, Wamsi, because it's the quarter where we get the yields up, which gets us the margin profile we need to go into the second quarter of the fiscal year at full production capacity. So it's on track, where we want it to be. We feel good about it. And this is going to be an important quarter for us, but it's something we know how to do in ramping a drive platform.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks for that. And I was wondering, if you can maybe bridge this quarter-on-quarter gross margin outlook, what the main puts and takes there are? How much are you thinking that the HDD side is going to contribute, given that some of the capacity enterprise weakness was -- capacity enterprise seems like a little bit weaker than what people were thinking? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Bob to make a few comments. And I think, if you look at gross margin going forward, there's a number of headwinds. We still have the COVID costs, we don't expect them to be as high next quarter as they were this quarter, but they're still there. The logistics cost, especially, it's just a very dynamic environment there that changes week by week. We've got the ramp of the 18-terabyte drive that we just talked about. So in the beginning phases of that ramp, you're going to -- it's a headwind on gross margin so we get up the ramp. That's why this is such an important quarter for us that we work through that. And, as I said, that's on track. And then on flash, we've got an easing pricing environment. So that's going to impact gross margin there. Bob, did I miss anything?\nBob Eulau: No, I think those are the keys. I mean on the hard drives, obviously, volumes are a little lower, so we'll be amortizing our fixed costs over a smaller volume as we go up the yield ramp on the 18-terabyte drives. Now on the flash side, as Dave said, I mean, we've got some price and mix headwind. And we also, as I mentioned in my comments, we have costs up a bit on K1, which amounts to about one percentage point on the flash side. So it's just we have multiple challenges this quarter. But I think long-term, we're going to be really well-positioned once we get up these product ramps.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks. Just kind of building off that last question a little bit. I mean, when you look at the hard disk drive gross margin at 27.2% and you adjust, it looks like adjusted ex-COVID, looks like it's close to about $32 million. I think it would be helpful just to kind of frame what the expectation is for COVID impact in this quarter? Is it probably not as high, but are we still carrying three percentage points plus of kind of headwind on gross margin? Just kind of any framework there. And on top of that, what are you seeing in pricing dynamics in nearline right now in the market?\nDavid Goeckeler: So I'll take the second one. Bob, can talk a little bit more about the first. All the businesses transacting at AT&T, it's a very competitive point in the market. There's no doubt about that. We're at the -- we're kind of at the tail end of one generation, moving to the next one, and that's why getting up the AT&T ramp is so -- 18, 16 ramp is so important for us. And that will position us well and be able to drive accretive margins to the portfolio on that point. But we expect that as we get 18 out there in the conversations with customers, it's a different TCO proposition for our customers, and that leads to more value for both of us. So we're heading to a better spot. I don't know, Bob, do you want to characterize COVID a little bit in this quarter? It's kind of -- it's a little tough because it's so dynamic.\nBob Eulau: Yes. Yes. It's not going to be as significant as last quarter. And last quarter, we did offset the COVID cost a bit by pricing, but obviously did not fully offset it. That's a big number. As we look at Q1, we don't think we're going to have the kind of absorption variances that we had last quarter. You may recall in the earnings call in April, I said that we had some challenges on volumes in April. So we already knew we had that headwind last quarter. We don't have that issue this quarter. So I would say the costs will be down, but I don't want to be too specific. We think we've got it covered in the guidance range that we articulated.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know there's a lot of discussion around cloud digestion, kind of mixed data points out there. Relative to the 30% implied nearline capacity ship growth this last quarter, what is your current assessment of the demand from a capacity ship standpoint nearline through the back half of this calendar year, any kind of views on that front?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We feel like we're definitely going into a digestion phase. If we look at -- we're coming off of three really strong quarters of exabyte shipment and the demand signals we're getting are going to be -- are a little bit down for the next quarter or two. We think that -- I mean, the long-term trend is obviously still good. We're using the cloud more every day. But there's been a lot of product shipped in there in the last couple of quarters. And what we're seeing from them is -- they're all not the same, right. We have all of them. So they're all at different points. But when you add it all up, you see next quarter, there's a negative bias on demand there from what we see looking backwards.\nAaron Rakers: So down sequential? Sorry.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you, gentlemen. I wanted to follow-up to Aaron's last question just on exabyte growth. You obviously -- you actually had a pretty strong quarter for exabyte growth within data center this quarter. But it does sound like the outlook is down sequentially, as you just indicated. I was hoping to you could juxtapose what you're seeing across both on-prem and private cloud environments versus public cloud, as it relates to, I guess, both your hard drive portfolio but also your enterprise SSD portfolio? That's my first question. And for my follow-up, I was hoping you could -- you've obviously been a little bit smaller player in the Enterprise SSD market off late, which has enabled some of the significant share gains. And quite frankly, you've completely turned around your technology portfolio within that Enterprise SSD market. Is your expectation going forward for September, that you should outperform end market demand given some of the share gains you've seen lately? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: So on the Enterprise SSD, you're right. We've done a lot of work to launch a new product in Enterprise SSD. We've got a couple of new products. The first one is out, and it's targeted to the cloud providers. The product targeted to the OEMs is yet to ship. So that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So we really are in a big product transition there. So it's hard for me to draw a conclusion to your question about on-prem versus the cloud given Enterprise SSD, because we're mainly focused on the cloud side right now, working our way through calls and all those kinds of things. Given that the product is new, given that we're going through a lot of qualifications, over a multi-quarter timeframe, I expect us to get better and better. It's going to be a little lumpy as we move through that. So if I look at the number of calls going on in the organization, it's across all technologies. We have twice as many calls going on as we had a year ago this time. So that gives you an idea of where -- how the portfolio is refreshing, and we're driving that into the market. On the hard drive side, I guess I can talk about the OEMs in the private data center more of just as a overall market. I mean, well, let me say that response for a different time because that's more PC related. But I don't know if I have a tremendous amount of insight. Bob, I don't know if you do on the hard drive side versus on-prem versus in the cloud, if you could draw any strong conclusions for that.\nBob Eulau: No, I think we're seeing softness in both areas as we move forward into Q1.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you for taking my question. The first one on the hard disk drive one of your competitors had referenced weaker demand trends, especially for client non-compute out of China. And when I -- when I just do a bath to envelope, if that is what's happening and impacting your client non-compute, it seems to me that X-to-Y shipment for that particular segment may have been down by more than 20% on a Q-o-Q basis. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on it? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll elaborate on the general market. I don't know if I can follow the back of your envelope that fast. But look, I think the channel was -- let me talk about the channel in general and smart video as part of that. That was a real slog this past quarter. I mean, the team worked really hard on it. We thought we saw TAM shrinkage there, significant TAM shrinkage of $100 million or so a year throughout the quarter. So it was -- we look at -- to us, that's a good indication of overall demand that's out there, and it was tough and related to that, and we see that going forward kind of a negative bias on that market. So I don't know, Bob, if you have any additional comments on the smart video in particular.\nBob Eulau: No, I agree in the short term. If we look over the longer time horizon, that is going to be another area of growth in the hard drive business. We really see the capacity in Enterprise business and the Smart Video business growing as we look over multiple years.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean I think this overall theme you're hearing from us, which is as we look at -- I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter we see some challenges given COVID, given the state of the economy, given all the demand we've seen in the first half and the inventory rationalizations and digestions that are going on. But in all of those markets, we see very good long-term trends. And so it's a question of how fast that comes back. But I think the pandemic has shown us the amount that all of us are relying on technology. And I think our portfolio is as well positioned for that world as it has been in some time.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Thanks for the detailed color. And just my follow-up question has to do with the Flash. You highlighted the fact that your revenues were up 70% or so. But I heard that commentary suggests there is an unfavorable mix shift into the September quarter. Perhaps you could help us better understand dynamic, if you were to elaborate on the mix of your NAND, how SSD and smartphone application are trending? And it seems to me that maybe the game console is happening later in the year? And if you could elaborate on it, it would be great.\nBob Eulau: Yes. So I think there are a bunch of pieces in there, Mehdi. So game console is definitely a growth area, and we're very fortunate to be participating in that. And as you know, we haven't been in the hard drive side of that business for quite a while. So it's all upside from our perspective. And then I would say, overall, there may be slight mix changes as we go quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing some pressure in terms of price, and that's factored into our guidance as well.\nPeter Andrew: Yes, Mehdi. This is Peter. Also don't forget, we do have a little bit of a step-up in the K1 cost, but as you go Q-to-Q, that will be another pressure on the flash gross margins.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. But in terms of the end market mix as it relates to Flash, there is -- you shouldn't assume a significant change?\nBob Eulau: I think the biggest change is the one I mentioned on game consoles becoming more significant. But otherwise, it will be up and down here and there, but I don't think it will be that material.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, as it relates to your overall revenue guide for September, down 11% sequentially, should we be thinking that each business is down similar to that rate? Is one doing better than the other? Could you shed a little light on that, please?\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure. I mean, I think we're seeing -- we're seeing retail -- last quarter, we started off in the retail business, which is roughly 20% of the business is really challenged, and it got better as the quarter went on and June was good. It wasn't quite all the way back to normal, but it was strong and we've seen that continue through July, and we're expecting that business to be positive in the quarter going forward. And if you look at all the other businesses, the cloud -- again, we talked about that. We see a digestion phase there. We see the OEMs, kind of really watching inventory and managing the OEMs, kind of really watching inventory and managing that tighter. And then I talked about the channel. So, as we said, long-term, we see good things where the portfolio is going. But in the near-term, that's how we see the four major businesses.\nC.J. Muse: And so if I just read between the lines, given the commentary on retail that would suggest NAND might be a little bit better than HDD?\nBob Eulau: I wouldn't draw specifics --\nDavid Goeckeler: I don't know if I'd go into that level of detail.\nC.J. Muse: Okay. And I guess a question on the Flash side and to follow-up on Mehdi's question. For the June quarter, I guess I was a little bit surprised by the lower ASP uplift, but higher bit growth. I guess, can you comment on what drove what drove that? And I guess just to follow-up, should we be assuming similar mix as the June quarter, coupled with an uplift in gaming, to -- as we build out we build out our ASP kind of assumptions?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So I'll make a few comments. I'm sure Bob will make a few comments. I mean, part of the ASP, looking back, was retail where ASPs were for Flash were more challenged. So, that's a big piece of that number. I think going forward, you shouldn't expect a tremendously different mix minus what you said gaming, it was good to see gaming start to ramp up. We expect that to continue to ramp through the second half of the year and take and take a low double-digit percent of our supply. So, that's a good story.\nBob Eulau: Yes, I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think in the transactional businesses, we've definitely seen more pricing pressure than we've seen from the OEMs, although overall, we think prices will be down this quarter.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about, in the NAND business, just how comfortable you are. I mean, last year, you -- when things got kind of weak, you guys took underutilization actions to kind of clean up inventory. You're not doing that now. Does that suggest supply/demand is in a healthier place? Or just anything you can kind of tell us about the state of your inventory, customer inventory, and your plan there?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I'll make a few comments, and Bob can make a few comments. Yes, I think we feel good about the amount -- the industry keeping supply/demand in balance. I mean, clearly, we've got a -- in a recession, we have a drop in demand. So, we're seeing some pricing implications of that. But we feel like the -- kind of where supply/ demand is, is fairly balanced going forward. We're certainly watching our CapEx investments very closely and managing more tightly with our partner. But Bob, do you want to say something about inventory?\nBob Eulau: Yes. I mean, I joined the company right in the middle of the last trough. And I can tell you, the supply and demand imbalance is nothing like it was then today. So I think everybody is behaving pretty rationally. We still see the industry growing bits and then bits both supply and demand in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%, and that's our intention as well.\nJoe Moore: Okay. And then my follow-up, it sounds like you're pretty comfortable on the adjusted EBITDA covenant calculations for September. But, obviously, memory can be uncertain beyond that. Can you talk about your comfort level overall on the covenants? And is there anything -- any actions you could take if things got worse to sort of make sure you don't have any issues there?\nBob Eulau: So I'm very comfortable. In fact, if you go back to the trough, I was just talking about; we never really got that close to breaching the covenant on the adjusted basis. So I really don't think there's much of a risk there.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, Joe, also just to put a little bit more transparency into the credit agreement metrics. Please make sure you take a look at the slide deck that's on our website. We've got a lot more detail on that metric in there.\nJoe Moore: Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nBob Eulau: Yes.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi. Good afternoon. I appreciate you guys taking the questions. I guess the first one for me is with regards to the gross margin guidance, could you give us a sense of which part of the business you expect to contract more of the hard drives versus flash? It sounds like on flash there\u2019s slight mix. And on retail, Bob as per your remarks, slight pricing pressure. They're not from OEM contract yet. And then, it sounds like on the hard drive business, it's probably more mix related. Is there anything in addition to that? And then could you just give us a sense of magnitude for each of these businesses? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nBob Eulau: Yes. I mean, I'll touch on it again. I don't want to get into too many specifics. As you know, we only guide gross margin for the company overall. But we're definitely seeing pressures on both sides, both on the hard drive and on the flash. Like we said before, we've got significant product transition going on, on the hard drive side. We've got a yield curve that we're working our way up. And we've got the COVID-19 pressures that they won't be as bad this coming quarter, the quarter we're in now, as they were last quarter. But we definitely have pressures on the hard drive side. And I would say, on the flash side, we're seeing pressures, primarily on price and a little bit of mix. And then the K1 cost that we talked about as well.\nAnanda Baruah: Right. The K1 costs. And guys, any -- you mentioned about going through a period of digestion in cloud, that dovetails with your top competitors' remarks and also, with the remarks of the hyperscalers. Any context you can provide around just, sort of, do you think that means the cycle is through or the digestion to you guys really just mean like a period of digestion and you think we can get back to some semblance of growth again in the near future?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, look, I mean, we see -- it's a long-term growth market. I mean, we see 35% CAGR exabyte growth in that market for years to come. We're coming off of a couple of quarters of significantly above that. It's not surprising we would go through a little bit of time where all of that capacity gets deployed. But I think just look at the world around us, I mean, we're all using the cloud more every day. I think the last five months have accelerated the amount of transformation that was going to happen in using of cloud technology significantly. So I don't -- I'm not exactly how we would both define a cycle, but I see a really good long-term trend in this and I see us well positioned as well. That's why this coming quarter is important for us to get the 1816 platform ramped, get the 1 million units produced, get those shipped to put ourselves in a good position for that continued growth.\nBobEulau: And just the one thing I would add. I just think there's been a lot of supply chain disruption this year, both in terms of our own production, our customers trying to make sure they get supply. Now our customers working off inventory levels. So I just think between the pandemic and the recession and concerns on supply, it's been a very challenging year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead.\nMitch Steves: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up a bit on the gross margin side. So when you talk about COVID-19 issue, kind of being a little bit better than you guys saw or better than last quarter. How do we think about the bigger drivers for your gross margins going back to 30%? Is there really going to be NAND improvement on pricing? Or is it going to be a lot of supply chain issues? Trying to get an understanding of what's really moving the margins so dramatically on a quarterly basis?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I'll maybe paint a big picture that, and Bob wants to go into a little bit of detail. So I mean it's worth important on both sides. But one is, on flash, first of all continue to drive BiCS5. BiCs4 is a great note for us giving us cost reductions and performance we need. The BiCS5 transition I think the team made really, really sound choices on going to that technology. As we talked about, the yields have been impressive. We're kind of ahead of internal plans on that node. So continuing to drive that technology roadmap that gives us cost advantages, is the first part of it. And then secondly, it's optimizing the portfolio on top of it for the markets we play in for optimizing gross margin. That's -- you see us moving more to enterprise SSD things that we think are going to drive higher margins. So that's a big part of it on flash. And of course, then you got pricing on top of that, which is a market concern. On the hard drive side, again, it's -- gross margin to me is led by innovation. So we ramp the 1816 terabyte platform, that's a better TCO for our customers, that's a better value proposition for them, that's higher gross margins for us. So that's why we're so focused on getting that -- getting up the production ramp on that and why we feel good about that platform. So those are the main drivers from my perspective. Bob?\nBobEulau: Yes. I don't think I have much to add. I mean think it's clear, we've got room to improve in both the hard drive area and in the flash area and we've got the products to make it happen.\nMitch Steves: Got it. And then just one other small one just on the smartphone cycle, I mean, it's been very clear that some of the bigger products got pushed out right to the time that they're going to ramp up more in Q4 into the Q3. Can you maybe give us an understanding of how that impacts you? And how you guys think about the push out and relates to the flash business?\nBob Eulau: Hey if I can start?\nDavid Goeckeler: I miss the question.\nBob Eulau: I will start. So as you know, we've been underweight mobile for quite a while. We continue to be underweight in terms of mobile. Now if that business is lower than was anticipated, our competitors need to find homes for those bits. So, we're not completely insulated from the challenges on the mobile side because they do need to move into other markets in order to move the bits. But I think in terms of our strategy of focusing on the other areas, I think it's worked out pretty well.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. On the NAND side, SSD side, I know you probably don't want to comment on how -- how much do you think NAND price is going to come down. But hypothetically, if prices start to decline more rapidly than your cost improvement over the next few quarters, say, 10%, 15%, 20% a quarter, how would you respond to that kind of pricing environment in terms of inventory utilization, CapEx, and so on and so forth? Thanks.\nBob Eulau: Yes, I guess I can start. I mean -- first of all, our view on cost reduction is still around 15% a year. So, we don't see that changing. We think that's what you're going to see in the 3D era because it's much more capital-intensive. And what we think you're going to see is a competitive marketplace where people are behaving rationally. I mean that's a lot of the reports that we've seen over the last couple of weeks. It seems like everybody is trying to make sure we don't end up in an oversupply situation. And we're going to be cautious, as I said, in terms of how we invest in our capital. Some of the CapEx we're funding right now is related to equipment we put in place last fiscal year. So, we'll keep a very close eye in terms of what's going on in terms of the balance of supply and demand.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I don't like to deal too much in hypotheticals, but we've got a lot of conviction in that market. If you just look at gaming, really coming on in the second half of this year. As you said, the 5G cycle may move around a little bit, but it's still out there. So, there's a lot of demand drivers and we believe in that 30% CAGR in that market on demand side.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could take a step back when you were coming up with your guidance sort of from a higher level. How much of it is coming from a lack of visibility versus maybe specific conversations with your customers? And then if you're looking at where there might be an opportunity for upside, where would that be? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I would say, in general, we look at a wide range of data points. I mean some of the businesses are like a retail business, what the trend that's going on there and what do we see and what may be disruptions. For example, in the period ahead, we typically see a back-to-school cycle. It's unclear what that's going to look like. So that puts some variability in the forecast. But we talked to our -- our teams are very, very close to our customers. So, we're talking to them on a near daily basis and getting a very -- a sense of what -- how they're thinking about their end markets and what the signals they're giving us for demand, and we're factoring all that in to kind of what they're telling us and what we see is the bias. And then we're wrapping in new product quals. I mean we talked about it in our prepared remarks. We're going through a bunch of very substantial product transitions. Now, we feel really good about that. But we got to get through it. There's risk in those. So, we make a risk-adjusted view of which of those are going to hit, which them are not, which ones may move around for various reasons. And I think, I said it earlier, we have twice as many various quals going right now as we did last year. And the number is over 450. So there's a lot of activity across the portfolio. The big ones, there's probably two, three, four dozen really big ones. So we factor that in as well. And we understand when they're going to hit and put some judgment around that, we wrap it all up into the guide. So if some of those quals move around, they could be in a positive or negative. There's enough of them that hopefully that balances out. But we put together our best view of what we think is going to happen over the next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much. Dave, maybe just following up with some of the NAND questions. You talked about the strong demand you're seeing for the BiCS5 product. Given some of the market dynamics that are going on right now, and you mentioned some price erosion and maybe a little bit of inventory that's been built and some digestion. How do you see that potentially affecting the ramp of the BiCS5 product? Does that push it out somewhat or are we going to see maybe a potentially steeper BiCS4 decline as BiCS5 ramps up?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I want to be careful. I don't think I talked about BiCS5 demand in the sense of BiCS. Our customers just look for the NAND products, and it's up to us to build the right technology for that. And as we drive the road map forward, we can get more advantageous cost for us. And what we're saying on BiCS5 is the development of the technology is going well, and the yields are going well. We've got the product in the retail channel already, and we are working on all the engineering work to put it into the whole product portfolio. So we will look to accelerate that work, as much as we can, to get as many things on that node as possible, but there's a lot of work to do there, right? Before we -- BiCS4 is a great node for us. It's providing us the performance and cost advantages that we need. As I said, I think 60% of our bids this quarter will be on BiCS4. You're going to see us -- BiCS4 will be our major node for several quarters to come as we work on the transition in the portfolio to BiCS5, which will then carry us for another several years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. I have a question about the cost on the NAND side. Bob, can you talk about, as BiCS5 ramps, I think previously you said your cost decline expectation is about mid-teens or so annual. As BiCS5 ramps, do you still expect that? And then also on the K1 cost, you said $80 million this quarter is the peak. And if demand continues to remain weak, how should we think about that $80 million coming down over the next few quarters? Thank you.\nBob Eulau: Yes. So, I guess, a couple of questions in there. First of all, we still believe over a number of quarters, we're going to average 15% year-over-year cost declines. And we think that's pretty sustainable. We've been able to achieve that with BiCS4. We think we'll be able to achieve that with BiCS5 and we'll continue to work through the transition. As Dave was just saying, it's going to take several quarters to ramp up on BiCS5. It's not going to be overnight. We throw a switch and we're on BiCS5. And BiCS4 has worked out really well. BiCS4 will be an even bigger percentage of the total next quarter than it is this quarter. So we still have a ways to go on BiCS4. And then in terms of the K1 costs, we do believe this is the peak. There's a lot of equipment getting installed. As you know, it's a long cycle time. So we've got to get products through the cycle. And then we'll be able to capitalize or our inventory more of those costs and bring down the period expenses as we move forward. So I think we're getting to the point where our volumes are getting up there where the period expenses will start to go away.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVijay Rakesh: Hi guys. Just two questions. I was wondering on our hard disk side, on the 18 terabyte, I know you mentioned it's a big product for you. Will you be shipping, and you said more than 1 million units here. So you expect that to ramp a couple million in December quarter? How does that ramp? And also, on the NAND side, it looks like the $80 million cost for Q1 start-up in September is almost like 300 bps of a gross margin headwind. So is that a clear 350 bps of gross of gross margin headwind looks like, so is that the majority of the gross margin headwind on NAND? Or is pricing a bigger factor in there? Thanks.\nBob Eulau: Want me to start?\nDavid Goeckeler: K1.\nBob Eulau: So let me start on K1. So we've been averaging around $60 million a quarter the last 4 quarters in terms of period expenses for the K1 fab. And then as we said, in the September quarter, we're going to go up to $80 million. So incrementally, it's about $20 million on the flash revenue, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of an incremental point. And as I just finished commenting on, as we start to ramp volumes, and we are, we'll start to absorb those costs. And I think we'll definitely see that number coming down in the couple of quarters following the September quarter. So I think we're in good shape there. And then in terms of volumes on the hard drive side, I mean, we definitely have plans to produce over 1 million units of 18 and 16-terabyte product, and we'll get as many of those out the door as we can this quarter.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We're not putting a number out there for the December quarter. But I think as we said, we want to get ourselves in a position where we're up the yield curves and we've got the manufacturing capacity to really step on the gas on that node. We're doing that now. We're working -- so this quarter, the important number is to get the production up so that we can get up that curve. And of course, we'll ship as many of them as we can.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing we're at the bottom of the hour and drawing to a close. I would now like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.\nPeter Andrew: Okay. Well, thank you everybody for taking the time to listen to Western Digital today. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Good day.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Thanks, everyone.\nBob Eulau: Thanks, folks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy and safe. As I reflect on my first full quarter as CEO of Western Digital, I am extremely proud of the way our team has navigated the complexities of uncertainties inherent in this unprecedented environment. As a company, we continue to adapt to provide continuity and high-quality products for our customers, deliver value to our shareholders and, importantly, prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We have a unique view into many drivers and trends that play both domestically and internationally due to the breadth of our portfolio of innovative flash and hard drive solutions going into cloud, OEM channel and retail end markets. We look at our business holistically, but it is especially important now to understand the nuances, challenges and opportunities in each market we serve. So before we dig into the results for the quarter and full year, I want to talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro trends are impacting the business. I'll then update you on how we are thinking about our strategic priorities for the fiscal year 2021, before turning it over to Bob for a financial update, which will be followed by Q&A. Western Digital has successfully managed through this unpredictable time with limited business impact from the pandemic. We made important investments and changes to minimize manufacturing and logistical challenges that were primarily impacting our hard drive business. Bob will discuss the financial impact of these later in the call. And we have maintained our focus on delivering for customers throughout. From an end market standpoint, demand was mixed in the quarter. And if there's a common theme among our end markets, it's uncertainty. In the second half of fiscal 2020, customers were focused on ensuring they had enough supply to meet heightened demand. As expected, demand in our cloud business was strong, due to the work-from-home trend. At the same time, healthy demand for our flash-based notebook solutions drove record revenue in our OEM end market. Finally, in retail, while we have a robust distribution channel with over 350,000 points of purchase around the world in well-established brands; we were impacted by COVID-related lockdowns at many of our brick-and-mortar customers. We did see the business recover as the quarter progressed due to easing of lockdowns and the transition to online buying with curbside pickup. As we look to the first half of fiscal 2020, one, uncertainty remains. We remain vigilant given the resurgence of the virus and its potential to disrupt our supply chain, including our ability to keep full teams working in our manufacturing facilities. Apart from COVID-19, we're managing through other macro trends. The global economic contraction is generally -- is generating an uncertain demand environment, and we are closely monitoring trade-related geopolitical developments, which are pertinent to a global business like ours. These near-term headwinds will eventually subside, and we are confident that the strength of our portfolio and strong customer relationships customer relationships are well-aligned to where the growth is, in the cloud and on the edge. We've continued to make strategic technology and product investments in both flash and hard drives to drive long-term revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Now turning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, results were generally in line with our guidance. We achieved this while partially offsetting higher than anticipated COVID-19 related costs, which Bob will discuss in more detail. We reported revenue of $4.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.23, mainly driven by growth in the cloud and record results for our client SSD portfolio for notebooks. Looking back at the full fiscal year 2020, I am pleased with our performance. Our end market diversity and breadth, broad customer base, channel reach and innovative leadership all position Western Digital to benefit from the multiyear growth in data creation and storage. For fiscal 2020, revenue totaled $16.7 billion and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.04. We continue to align our portfolio with a sharp focus on growth and margin improvement. Importantly, over the last year, we brought to market several exciting new innovations across both flash and hard drives that I'd like to touch upon. Starting with flash, as you know, we believe flash is the greatest long-term growth opportunity for Western Digital and is an area where we've already had a tremendous foundation with consumer cards, USB drives and client and enterprise SSDs. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, the migration to flash within game consoles is yet another example of flash penetrating deeper into the edge and endpoint. The adoption of 5G and the build-out of the edge to support new generation of real-time services is another exciting development. We see an expanding TAM for flash that underpins a multiyear growth opportunity. To capitalize on this opportunity, we launched BiCS5, our 112-layer flash product in retail last quarter, which delivers exceptional capacity, performance and reliability, all at an attractive cost. The ramp has gone very well with impressive yields and we are just at the beginning stages of this product ramp. While we focus on ramping BiCS5, BiCS4 has continued to provide the right balance of performance and cost reduction. BiCS4 represented over 60% of bits shipped in the quarter. Earlier this year, we celebrated the first production wafer shipment from our K1 fab, our new manufacturing facility for 3D BiCS flash memory. This is another important milestone reflecting the successful 20-year partnership we've had with Kioxia. Another major highlight has been the ramp of our Enterprise SSD product line. Enterprise SSD revenue in the quarter grew nearly 70% sequentially and our revenue share increased to the low double digits. This will remain an important area of focus within our flash portfolio. Now turning to hard drives, we continue to lead the industry in aerial density using innovations across the entire drive, algorithms, firmware, mechanical, heads and media. We were the first in the industry to ship energy-assisted drives for mass production and expect a strong ramp into the fiscal second quarter and beyond. In short, we are going through important product transitions in both our flash and HDD businesses that we think set up Western Digital well for the future. Recognizing that these are uncertain times, we believe that the most important thing we can do is keep our foot on the proverbial innovation pedal and execute on the road map across the business. We have an extremely talented team working on new products that will continue to drive leadership in flash and hard drives. Looking ahead, our strategic priorities are centered around driving innovation for customers and value for shareholders. First and foremost, we will focus on driving long-term shareholder value as we bolster our flash and HDD portfolios, including ramping two important product lines to high volume, our SSD products and our energy-assisted capacity enterprise drives. Secondly, we will accelerate our transition to BiCS5 delivering additional performance for our customers and notable cost advantages for Western Digital. Third, we will continue to sharpen our execution from a product road map and strategic business objectives. And finally, we are evolving our portfolio to drive growth, margin improvement and cash generation, while also paying down debt and investing in the future. In the near term, we expect to remain challenged by the pandemic in the global economic contraction. Internally, we're also navigating multiple substantial product transitions, which will require sharp execution focus, but we are very confident they will set us up well for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to share our financial highlights and outlook. Thanks, Bob. While we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment, I'm confident that Western Digital can lead the market for years to come. As I've said, I came here because I have a very strong conviction that Western Digital can play an increasingly vital role in the digital transformation, and that conviction has only strengthened in the past five months. We have deep flash and HDD product portfolio, operational scale and great customer relationships, combined with the ever-growing demand for data creation and storage. All in all, it's a great place to be, and I'm extremely thankful for the hard work that our talented global team puts in on a day-in and day-out basis. We're operating in uncertain times, but Western Digital's strong consistent performance reflects our ability to maintain our market leadership, by delivering technological innovation with the quality, performance and cost effectiveness that our customers rely upon. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. Yes. No, it hasn't pushed out. The ramp is on plan, as we've talked about. We plan on producing in excess of 1 million units this quarter. It's a very important quarter for us on that ramp, Wamsi, because it's the quarter where we get the yields up, which gets us the margin profile we need to go into the second quarter of the fiscal year at full production capacity. So it's on track, where we want it to be. We feel good about it. And this is going to be an important quarter for us, but it's something we know how to do in ramping a drive platform. Yes. I'll make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Bob to make a few comments. And I think, if you look at gross margin going forward, there's a number of headwinds. We still have the COVID costs, we don't expect them to be as high next quarter as they were this quarter, but they're still there. The logistics cost, especially, it's just a very dynamic environment there that changes week by week. We've got the ramp of the 18-terabyte drive that we just talked about. So in the beginning phases of that ramp, you're going to -- it's a headwind on gross margin so we get up the ramp. That's why this is such an important quarter for us that we work through that. And, as I said, that's on track. And then on flash, we've got an easing pricing environment. So that's going to impact gross margin there. Bob, did I miss anything? So I'll take the second one. Bob, can talk a little bit more about the first. All the businesses transacting at AT&T, it's a very competitive point in the market. There's no doubt about that. We're at the -- we're kind of at the tail end of one generation, moving to the next one, and that's why getting up the AT&T ramp is so -- 18, 16 ramp is so important for us. And that will position us well and be able to drive accretive margins to the portfolio on that point. But we expect that as we get 18 out there in the conversations with customers, it's a different TCO proposition for our customers, and that leads to more value for both of us. So we're heading to a better spot. I don't know, Bob, do you want to characterize COVID a little bit in this quarter? It's kind of -- it's a little tough because it's so dynamic. Yes. We feel like we're definitely going into a digestion phase. If we look at -- we're coming off of three really strong quarters of exabyte shipment and the demand signals we're getting are going to be -- are a little bit down for the next quarter or two. We think that -- I mean, the long-term trend is obviously still good. We're using the cloud more every day. But there's been a lot of product shipped in there in the last couple of quarters. And what we're seeing from them is -- they're all not the same, right. We have all of them. So they're all at different points. But when you add it all up, you see next quarter, there's a negative bias on demand there from what we see looking backwards. Yes. So on the Enterprise SSD, you're right. We've done a lot of work to launch a new product in Enterprise SSD. We've got a couple of new products. The first one is out, and it's targeted to the cloud providers. The product targeted to the OEMs is yet to ship. So that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So we really are in a big product transition there. So it's hard for me to draw a conclusion to your question about on-prem versus the cloud given Enterprise SSD, because we're mainly focused on the cloud side right now, working our way through calls and all those kinds of things. Given that the product is new, given that we're going through a lot of qualifications, over a multi-quarter timeframe, I expect us to get better and better. It's going to be a little lumpy as we move through that. So if I look at the number of calls going on in the organization, it's across all technologies. We have twice as many calls going on as we had a year ago this time. So that gives you an idea of where -- how the portfolio is refreshing, and we're driving that into the market. On the hard drive side, I guess I can talk about the OEMs in the private data center more of just as a overall market. I mean, well, let me say that response for a different time because that's more PC related. But I don't know if I have a tremendous amount of insight. Bob, I don't know if you do on the hard drive side versus on-prem versus in the cloud, if you could draw any strong conclusions for that. Yes. I'll elaborate on the general market. I don't know if I can follow the back of your envelope that fast. But look, I think the channel was -- let me talk about the channel in general and smart video as part of that. That was a real slog this past quarter. I mean, the team worked really hard on it. We thought we saw TAM shrinkage there, significant TAM shrinkage of $100 million or so a year throughout the quarter. So it was -- we look at -- to us, that's a good indication of overall demand that's out there, and it was tough and related to that, and we see that going forward kind of a negative bias on that market. So I don't know, Bob, if you have any additional comments on the smart video in particular. Yes. I mean I think this overall theme you're hearing from us, which is as we look at -- I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter we see some challenges given COVID, given the state of the economy, given all the demand we've seen in the first half and the inventory rationalizations and digestions that are going on. But in all of those markets, we see very good long-term trends. And so it's a question of how fast that comes back. But I think the pandemic has shown us the amount that all of us are relying on technology. And I think our portfolio is as well positioned for that world as it has been in some time. Sure. I mean, I think we're seeing -- we're seeing retail -- last quarter, we started off in the retail business, which is roughly 20% of the business is really challenged, and it got better as the quarter went on and June was good. It wasn't quite all the way back to normal, but it was strong and we've seen that continue through July, and we're expecting that business to be positive in the quarter going forward. And if you look at all the other businesses, the cloud -- again, we talked about that. We see a digestion phase there. We see the OEMs, kind of really watching inventory and managing the OEMs, kind of really watching inventory and managing that tighter. And then I talked about the channel. So, as we said, long-term, we see good things where the portfolio is going. But in the near-term, that's how we see the four major businesses. I don't know if I'd go into that level of detail. Yes. So I'll make a few comments. I'm sure Bob will make a few comments. I mean, part of the ASP, looking back, was retail where ASPs were for Flash were more challenged. So, that's a big piece of that number. I think going forward, you shouldn't expect a tremendously different mix minus what you said gaming, it was good to see gaming start to ramp up. We expect that to continue to ramp through the second half of the year and take and take a low double-digit percent of our supply. So, that's a good story. Yes, I'll make a few comments, and Bob can make a few comments. Yes, I think we feel good about the amount -- the industry keeping supply/demand in balance. I mean, clearly, we've got a -- in a recession, we have a drop in demand. So, we're seeing some pricing implications of that. But we feel like the -- kind of where supply/ demand is, is fairly balanced going forward. We're certainly watching our CapEx investments very closely and managing more tightly with our partner. But Bob, do you want to say something about inventory? Hey, Joe, also just to put a little bit more transparency into the credit agreement metrics. Please make sure you take a look at the slide deck that's on our website. We've got a lot more detail on that metric in there. Thank you. Yes. I mean, look, I mean, we see -- it's a long-term growth market. I mean, we see 35% CAGR exabyte growth in that market for years to come. We're coming off of a couple of quarters of significantly above that. It's not surprising we would go through a little bit of time where all of that capacity gets deployed. But I think just look at the world around us, I mean, we're all using the cloud more every day. I think the last five months have accelerated the amount of transformation that was going to happen in using of cloud technology significantly. So I don't -- I'm not exactly how we would both define a cycle, but I see a really good long-term trend in this and I see us well positioned as well. That's why this coming quarter is important for us to get the 1816 platform ramped, get the 1 million units produced, get those shipped to put ourselves in a good position for that continued growth. Yes. I'll maybe paint a big picture that, and Bob wants to go into a little bit of detail. So I mean it's worth important on both sides. But one is, on flash, first of all continue to drive BiCS5. BiCs4 is a great note for us giving us cost reductions and performance we need. The BiCS5 transition I think the team made really, really sound choices on going to that technology. As we talked about, the yields have been impressive. We're kind of ahead of internal plans on that node. So continuing to drive that technology roadmap that gives us cost advantages, is the first part of it. And then secondly, it's optimizing the portfolio on top of it for the markets we play in for optimizing gross margin. That's -- you see us moving more to enterprise SSD things that we think are going to drive higher margins. So that's a big part of it on flash. And of course, then you got pricing on top of that, which is a market concern. On the hard drive side, again, it's -- gross margin to me is led by innovation. So we ramp the 1816 terabyte platform, that's a better TCO for our customers, that's a better value proposition for them, that's higher gross margins for us. So that's why we're so focused on getting that -- getting up the production ramp on that and why we feel good about that platform. So those are the main drivers from my perspective. Bob? I miss the question. Yes. I mean, I don't like to deal too much in hypotheticals, but we've got a lot of conviction in that market. If you just look at gaming, really coming on in the second half of this year. As you said, the 5G cycle may move around a little bit, but it's still out there. So, there's a lot of demand drivers and we believe in that 30% CAGR in that market on demand side. Yes, I would say, in general, we look at a wide range of data points. I mean some of the businesses are like a retail business, what the trend that's going on there and what do we see and what may be disruptions. For example, in the period ahead, we typically see a back-to-school cycle. It's unclear what that's going to look like. So that puts some variability in the forecast. But we talked to our -- our teams are very, very close to our customers. So, we're talking to them on a near daily basis and getting a very -- a sense of what -- how they're thinking about their end markets and what the signals they're giving us for demand, and we're factoring all that in to kind of what they're telling us and what we see is the bias. And then we're wrapping in new product quals. I mean we talked about it in our prepared remarks. We're going through a bunch of very substantial product transitions. Now, we feel really good about that. But we got to get through it. There's risk in those. So, we make a risk-adjusted view of which of those are going to hit, which them are not, which ones may move around for various reasons. And I think, I said it earlier, we have twice as many various quals going right now as we did last year. And the number is over 450. So there's a lot of activity across the portfolio. The big ones, there's probably two, three, four dozen really big ones. So we factor that in as well. And we understand when they're going to hit and put some judgment around that, we wrap it all up into the guide. So if some of those quals move around, they could be in a positive or negative. There's enough of them that hopefully that balances out. But we put together our best view of what we think is going to happen over the next quarter. Yes. I want to be careful. I don't think I talked about BiCS5 demand in the sense of BiCS. Our customers just look for the NAND products, and it's up to us to build the right technology for that. And as we drive the road map forward, we can get more advantageous cost for us. And what we're saying on BiCS5 is the development of the technology is going well, and the yields are going well. We've got the product in the retail channel already, and we are working on all the engineering work to put it into the whole product portfolio. So we will look to accelerate that work, as much as we can, to get as many things on that node as possible, but there's a lot of work to do there, right? Before we -- BiCS4 is a great node for us. It's providing us the performance and cost advantages that we need. As I said, I think 60% of our bids this quarter will be on BiCS4. You're going to see us -- BiCS4 will be our major node for several quarters to come as we work on the transition in the portfolio to BiCS5, which will then carry us for another several years. K1. Yes. We're not putting a number out there for the December quarter. But I think as we said, we want to get ourselves in a position where we're up the yield curves and we've got the manufacturing capacity to really step on the gas on that node. We're doing that now. We're working -- so this quarter, the important number is to get the production up so that we can get up that curve. And of course, we'll ship as many of them as we can. Yes. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a challenging global economy that has continued to impact Western Digital's performance, in large part due to the high level of uncertainty that both we and our customers are facing. While this uncertainty isn't going away in the near term, we'll continue to adapt, and we believe Western Digital is well positioned for the future. With that, I'll walk you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 18% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $16.7 billion, up 1% from fiscal 2019 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.04. Looking at end market, Client Devices revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5% on a sequential basis and up 19% year-over-year. Within this end market, our robust family of client SSDs, which are ideally suited for remote learning and work from home applications, achieved another record quarter of revenue. Notebook and desktop related hard drive revenue declined slightly sequentially as the market continued to transition to SSD-based products. Smart video was weaker than our expectations due to continued headwinds associated with the pandemic. In Gaming, we began shipping our flash solutions for the upcoming new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue was down sequentially, but up year-over-year, off a low base. Moving on to Data Center Devices and Solutions. Fourth quarter revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, revenue of $6.2 billion was up 24% from fiscal year 2019. Capacity enterprise hard drive revenue was down slightly on a sequential basis, while enterprise SSD revenue grew nearly 70% sequentially and more than doubled from a year ago. Next, Client Solutions revenue was $687 million, down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year due to COVID-19 related lockdowns. Despite this, we were encouraged to see demand pick up in June, as countries began to ease lockdown restrictions and as brick-and-mortar locations shifted more of their operations online. This strength continued into July. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we executed very well in this business in a difficult environment. With over 350,000 points of purchase around the world, we continue to have incredibly strong distribution breadth brand recognition. Turning to revenue by product category. Flash revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 49% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were up 1% sequentially on a blended basis and up 3% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 8% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. Total exabyte shipments were down 2%. On a sequential basis, the average price per hard drive increased 2% to $87 as mix continued to shift to the cloud. As we move on to cost and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 1 percentage point sequentially to 28.9%, slightly below our guidance range. The major item that impacted our gross margin was COVID-19 related costs of $96 million. This almost exclusively impacted hard drive -- the hard drive business and was primarily related to reduced factory utilization and higher logistics costs. For clarity, this item was included in our non-GAAP gross margin. Our Flash gross margin was 30.5%, up 4 percentage points from last quarter due to cost reductions and slightly favorable pricing. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter. The biggest driver of the lower gross margin was the $96 million in COVID-19 related costs, representing a 4.7 percentage point impact on our hard drive gross margin. Operating expenses were $713 million, well below our guidance range, primarily due to our decision to cap variable compensation expense given the current economic environment. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.23. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $172 million and free cash flow was $261 million. In fiscal 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and activity-related to Flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $89 million due to the timing of funds flowing to and from the joint ventures. In the fourth quarter, we distributed $150 million in dividends to our shareholders, which was our final distribution prior to suspending the dividend. We also made a standard $63 million debt repayment in the fourth quarter. I would note that we have already made an optional debt repayment of $150 million in July. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.7 billion. Our debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.2 times in the fourth quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.8 times. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes an approximate $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures, which is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Moving on to guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We are somewhat challenged in the near-term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic and being in the midst of a global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and focus on our great products, deep customer relationships, and large and growing markets. We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long-term. We expect revenue in the first fiscal quarter to be in the range of $3.70 billion to $3.9 billion. Growth in Client Solutions is expected to be more than offset by a decline in both Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Devices. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25% and 27%. This range includes approximately $80 million in costs associated with the K1 fab. This should be the peak quarter in fiscal 2021 for K1 period expenses. We expect operating expenses to be between $700 million and $720 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be between $70 million and $80 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 26% in Q1 and for the full fiscal year 2021. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.65 in Q1, assuming approximately 304 million fully diluted shares. Gross capital expenditures, which includes our includes portion of the joint venture, leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures. We will continue to monitor capital expenditures very closely given the current business environment. In summary, we are executing well in a challenging environment and results are generally in line with expectations. We are taking decisive steps to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment, while ensuring we focus our resources to address the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead. I'll now turn it back over to Dave. No, I think those are the keys. I mean on the hard drives, obviously, volumes are a little lower, so we'll be amortizing our fixed costs over a smaller volume as we go up the yield ramp on the 18-terabyte drives. Now on the flash side, as Dave said, I mean, we've got some price and mix headwind. And we also, as I mentioned in my comments, we have costs up a bit on K1, which amounts to about one percentage point on the flash side. So it's just we have multiple challenges this quarter. But I think long-term, we're going to be really well-positioned once we get up these product ramps. Yes. Yes. It's not going to be as significant as last quarter. And last quarter, we did offset the COVID cost a bit by pricing, but obviously did not fully offset it. That's a big number. As we look at Q1, we don't think we're going to have the kind of absorption variances that we had last quarter. You may recall in the earnings call in April, I said that we had some challenges on volumes in April. So we already knew we had that headwind last quarter. We don't have that issue this quarter. So I would say the costs will be down, but I don't want to be too specific. We think we've got it covered in the guidance range that we articulated. No, I think we're seeing softness in both areas as we move forward into Q1. No, I agree in the short term. If we look over the longer time horizon, that is going to be another area of growth in the hard drive business. We really see the capacity in Enterprise business and the Smart Video business growing as we look over multiple years. Yes. So I think there are a bunch of pieces in there, Mehdi. So game console is definitely a growth area, and we're very fortunate to be participating in that. And as you know, we haven't been in the hard drive side of that business for quite a while. So it's all upside from our perspective. And then I would say, overall, there may be slight mix changes as we go quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing some pressure in terms of price, and that's factored into our guidance as well. I think the biggest change is the one I mentioned on game consoles becoming more significant. But otherwise, it will be up and down here and there, but I don't think it will be that material. I wouldn't draw specifics -- Yes, I don't have a lot to add. I mean I think in the transactional businesses, we've definitely seen more pricing pressure than we've seen from the OEMs, although overall, we think prices will be down this quarter. Yes. I mean, I joined the company right in the middle of the last trough. And I can tell you, the supply and demand imbalance is nothing like it was then today. So I think everybody is behaving pretty rationally. We still see the industry growing bits and then bits both supply and demand in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%, and that's our intention as well. So I'm very comfortable. In fact, if you go back to the trough, I was just talking about; we never really got that close to breaching the covenant on the adjusted basis. So I really don't think there's much of a risk there. Yes. Yes. I mean, I'll touch on it again. I don't want to get into too many specifics. As you know, we only guide gross margin for the company overall. But we're definitely seeing pressures on both sides, both on the hard drive and on the flash. Like we said before, we've got significant product transition going on, on the hard drive side. We've got a yield curve that we're working our way up. And we've got the COVID-19 pressures that they won't be as bad this coming quarter, the quarter we're in now, as they were last quarter. But we definitely have pressures on the hard drive side. And I would say, on the flash side, we're seeing pressures, primarily on price and a little bit of mix. And then the K1 cost that we talked about as well. And just the one thing I would add. I just think there's been a lot of supply chain disruption this year, both in terms of our own production, our customers trying to make sure they get supply. Now our customers working off inventory levels. So I just think between the pandemic and the recession and concerns on supply, it's been a very challenging year. Yes. I don't think I have much to add. I mean think it's clear, we've got room to improve in both the hard drive area and in the flash area and we've got the products to make it happen. Hey if I can start? I will start. So as you know, we've been underweight mobile for quite a while. We continue to be underweight in terms of mobile. Now if that business is lower than was anticipated, our competitors need to find homes for those bits. So, we're not completely insulated from the challenges on the mobile side because they do need to move into other markets in order to move the bits. But I think in terms of our strategy of focusing on the other areas, I think it's worked out pretty well. Yes, I guess I can start. I mean -- first of all, our view on cost reduction is still around 15% a year. So, we don't see that changing. We think that's what you're going to see in the 3D era because it's much more capital-intensive. And what we think you're going to see is a competitive marketplace where people are behaving rationally. I mean that's a lot of the reports that we've seen over the last couple of weeks. It seems like everybody is trying to make sure we don't end up in an oversupply situation. And we're going to be cautious, as I said, in terms of how we invest in our capital. Some of the CapEx we're funding right now is related to equipment we put in place last fiscal year. So, we'll keep a very close eye in terms of what's going on in terms of the balance of supply and demand. Yes. So, I guess, a couple of questions in there. First of all, we still believe over a number of quarters, we're going to average 15% year-over-year cost declines. And we think that's pretty sustainable. We've been able to achieve that with BiCS4. We think we'll be able to achieve that with BiCS5 and we'll continue to work through the transition. As Dave was just saying, it's going to take several quarters to ramp up on BiCS5. It's not going to be overnight. We throw a switch and we're on BiCS5. And BiCS4 has worked out really well. BiCS4 will be an even bigger percentage of the total next quarter than it is this quarter. So we still have a ways to go on BiCS4. And then in terms of the K1 costs, we do believe this is the peak. There's a lot of equipment getting installed. As you know, it's a long cycle time. So we've got to get products through the cycle. And then we'll be able to capitalize or our inventory more of those costs and bring down the period expenses as we move forward. So I think we're getting to the point where our volumes are getting up there where the period expenses will start to go away. Want me to start? So let me start on K1. So we've been averaging around $60 million a quarter the last 4 quarters in terms of period expenses for the K1 fab. And then as we said, in the September quarter, we're going to go up to $80 million. So incrementally, it's about $20 million on the flash revenue, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of an incremental point. And as I just finished commenting on, as we start to ramp volumes, and we are, we'll start to absorb those costs. And I think we'll definitely see that number coming down in the couple of quarters following the September quarter. So I think we're in good shape there. And then in terms of volumes on the hard drive side, I mean, we definitely have plans to produce over 1 million units of 18 and 16-terabyte product, and we'll get as many of those out the door as we can this quarter. Thanks, folks."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results. I'm pleased that the Western Digital team executed well and delivered solid results in light of the ongoing macro and geopolitical dynamics. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 32% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78, all within the guidance ranges we provided in April. Fiscal year 2022 revenue totaled $18.8 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.22. This compares to revenue of $16.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.55 in fiscal year 2021. We grew revenue 11% and EPS increased 81%, demonstrating progress in unlocking the earnings potential of our business. In addition to strong financial performance, fiscal year 2022 was a hallmark year for Western Digital from an innovation, product development and execution perspective. In particular, we regained innovation leadership with the introduction of multiple products and technologies for the cloud. In May, we announced a 26-terabyte drive, leveraging our OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies as well as ePMR. Impressively, this means we've nearly doubled drive capacity relative to when I joined Western Digital just over two years ago. In Flash, we expanded adoption of our NVMe enterprise SSD from one cloud titan to three as well as qualification at several enterprise OEM suppliers. From an organization perspective, we have bolstered the company's executive management team, further strengthening our ability to drive operational excellence, innovation and disciplined financial management. On top of all of these achievements, we reduced debt by $1.7 billion and attained an investment-grade corporate rating, placing Western Digital on a solid financial foundation. Before I jump into additional detail on the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our strategic review. As you know, two months ago, we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing long-term value for our shareholders. The Executive Committee of the Board, which I lead, continues to oversee the review and Elliott Management is participating alongside us under a non-disclosure agreement, along with other interested parties. We're evaluating a range of alternatives, including options for separating our market-leading Flash and HDD franchises. We are moving expeditiously, but this work will take time. We will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today giving -- given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process. We will provide updates in the future as appropriate. Now I'll provide updates on our HDD and Flash businesses. During the fiscal fourth quarter, strong demand from our cloud customers for our latest generation energy-assisted drives drove near-record near-line shipments of 111 exabytes. Total HDD revenue declined sequentially due primarily to consumer and client HDD demand. We commenced commercial shipment of a number of products incorporating our OptiNAND technology. In addition to shipments of our 20- terabyte and 22-terabyte CMR drives, qualifications of our 26-terabyte SMR drive are underway, as we noted at our product launch event in May. This SMR-enabled drive enables 20% higher capacity than our CMR variants, offering significantly better TCO for our cloud customers and further highlighting the performance-driven benefits of the innovation that Western Digital is packing into a hard drive. Finally, we are ramping a second cloud customer with SMR technology this quarter and remain on track to lead the industry's transition to SMR-based drives for the cloud. We are very confident in our multiyear product roadmap for capacity enterprise drives, which combine ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR and triple-stage actuators to deliver a cutting-edge portfolio of drives in commercial volumes at a wide variety of capacity points. We also continue to invest in HAMR and the commercialization of this technology alongside our other HDD technologies that are leading the industry. The breadth and depth of this portfolio strongly positions us to be the provider of choice for the largest and most complex data centers in the world. Building on the expertise cultivated over decades of bringing to market industry-leading technologies, we are committed to leveraging our innovations to continue driving business results in capacity enterprise into the future. Turning to Flash. Revenue grew sequentially on an improving product mix and increased flash supply. Growth in Flash during the quarter came primarily from enterprise SSD, with revenue more than doubling sequentially. Gaming is another key growth market for us, where we continue to demonstrate the strength of our client SSD franchise with exabyte shipment growing nearly 70% year-over-year. We have a leading position in gaming with our WD_BLACK brand being recognized globally for innovation, performance and quality. The latest example of this is our WD_BLACK SN-850 NVMe SSD product certified for Sony PS5 game consoles, which enables players to expand the high-speed storage capacity of their PS5 console and allows them to store and play both PS5 and PS4 games directly from the drive. On the technology front, BiCS5 represented about half of our Flash revenue in the June quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter. We are preparing to ramp BiCS6 late this calendar year and into 2023. Based on circuit under array architecture, BiCS6 enables many exciting high-performance products for 5G phones, SSDs and QLC flash. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In the cloud end market, we experienced strength in the fiscal fourth quarter as supply constraints at Western Digital and our end customers started to ease. Overall, demand from our cloud customers has been consistently strong and we expect this strength in cloud to carry into the second half of calendar year 2022. We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive cloud growth and believe we are on track to generate about half of our revenue from this market by fiscal year 2025. Outside of cloud, our expectations for calendar year 2022 demand growth have moderated since our last earnings call. As the fiscal fourth quarter progressed, we saw consumer spending soften, impacting both retail Flash and HDD demand. This weakness has migrated to the consumer PC end market as we enter the second half of the calendar year. In client, the market generally expect PC shipments to decline approximately 10% in calendar year 2022. We are seeing our PC OEM customers aggressively rightsize their inventory to reflect current demand conditions, which will impact our business in this market in the second half of the calendar year. After going through that correction, we expect a more normal flow of business going forward as we believe PCs will continue to fulfill broader use cases as the foundation of the increasingly common hybrid enterprise, driving unit demand above pre-pandemic levels in richer SSD content. All of these PC market dynamics are accelerating the final phase of the shift of client devices from HDD to flash technology. Consequently, the client HDD market is now declining at an accelerated rate relative to the period before the onset of the pandemic. To reflect this reality, we are now taking aggressive action to restructure our HDD manufacturing footprint to reflect this market dynamic. In mobile, expectations for smartphone units have come down in recent months, led primarily by reduced demand in China. Industry analysts expect the smartphone industry unit volume to decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year in calendar 2022. While we are well-positioned in supplying flash memory for 5G smartphones, we are also seeing our largest customers aggressively resetting their inventories for these products. We expect the inventory correction to be primarily impact our fiscal first quarter and return to market demand for the remainder of the fiscal year. In consumer, we have a premium brand and a great franchise in the marketplace. In particular, we have developed an enviable position and excellent relationships with major brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers across the globe, including Best Buy and Target in the US, MSH Group in Europe, JD.com in China and Officeworks in Australia. As a result of these strong relationships, our impressive scale, product breadth and trusted brand, we lead most consumer storage product categories. While macroeconomic factors and COVID measures have impacted consumer demand in the near term, our customers' loyalty and preference for the performance and quality of our solutions are key differentiators, which will position Western Digital well, for the upcoming back-to-school and holiday seasons. Before turning the call over to Wissam, I want to leave you with a few takeaways. First, at the Investor Day, we laid out the case, where the world of ever-increasing intelligent devices powered by the cloud is creating an astonishing amount of data, of which only a small percentage is stored. Our conviction remains strong and our view on near double-digit revenue growth remains intact. Over the past several years, the storage market has entered an era of accelerated growth, led by the strength of the cloud market, which drove HDD revenue growth for Western Digital and the industry. In Flash, capital investments for incremental NAND bit growth are becoming more expensive, resulting in a more disciplined investment across the industry. At Western Digital, our long-standing and growing relationships with hyperscale and OEM customers across the world, coupled with our leadership in commercializing innovations for capacity enterprise hard drives and momentum with NVMe enterprise SSD for data center, has made us a trusted partner. This combination of rapid demand growth in storage, technology leadership and product momentum offer Western Digital opportunities for financial outperformance. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results and provide an outlook for the fiscal first quarter.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our expectations, reflecting the resilience and agility of our business model, against such a dynamic macro environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78, within the guidance range we provided in April. For the full fiscal year 2022, revenue was $18.8 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 4.3 percentage points and non-GAAP operating margin increased 5.7 percentage points, as we proactively managed our expenses, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $8.22, up 81% from last year. Turning to our end markets. For the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 46% of total revenue at $2.1 billion, up 18% sequentially and 5% from a year ago. Within Cloud, Western Digital's continued success in leading the industry transition to energy-assisted hard drives drove the growth. The continued ramp of our 18-terabyte and 20-terabyte drives drove a 7% year-over-year increase in nearline HDD revenue. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments increased 9% to 111 exabytes. In Flash, enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled sequentially and was up 38% year-over-year. The client end market represented 36% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, down 5% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, client HDD led the revenue decline, while Flash revenue was roughly flat. Consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.8 billion, down 9% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the revenue decline due to lower HDD retail shipments. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline in retail products across HDD and Flash. For the full fiscal year 2022, Cloud revenue increased 40% year-over-year, led by a 38% increase in nearline HDD. Flash product revenue for enterprise SSD applications more than doubled year-over-year. Client revenue decreased 3% year-over-year as growth in Flash was offset by a 30% decrease in client HDD. Client HDD for PCs and Notebooks represents just mid-single-digit percentage of total HDD revenue exiting the fiscal year. Lastly, consumer revenue decreased 6% for the year, all attributed to a decline in retail HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we reported Flash revenue of $2.4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were up 2% on a blended basis and up slightly on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. HDD revenue of $2.1 billion was flat sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per HDD increased by 19% to $120 as our mix continues to transition towards the cloud. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 10% and average price per unit increased by 24%. As we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. We continue to exert disciplined financial management to drive better results. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.3%, up 60 basis points sequentially and down 60 basis points year-over-year. Our Flash gross margin was 35.9%, up 30 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, growth in enterprise SSD for data center applications led the improvement in gross margin. Our HDD gross margin was 28.2%, up 50 basis points sequentially and down 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $760 million were below our guidance range as we continue to prudently manage our expenses. Operating income was $702 million, representing an 8% increase from the prior quarter and a 15% decrease year-over-year. Our tax rate was 11% for both the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. Earnings per share was $1.78, compared to $1.65 in the prior quarter, and $2.16 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $295 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $97 million. Operating cash flow was impacted by revenue linearity. The ramp back to normal production output at the flash joint venture, timing of component deliveries to our factories and corporate-related control measures in China contributed to a back-end loaded quarter. Cash, capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment; and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $392 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity. Gross CapEx and cash CapEx for the fiscal year 2022 were $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, below our expectation, as we actively managed our capital investments. We made a $150 million scheduled and discretionary debt repayment. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5 times compared to 2.4 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This amount is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. I'll now provide our view of both HDD and Flash businesses for the fiscal first quarter as well as comments on several key items for fiscal year 2023. For the fiscal first quarter, we expect Flash to lead the sequential revenue decline as our customer's right-size their inventory. We expect a relatively modest decline in overall HDD revenue, primarily driven by client and consumer, with gross margin relatively flat. As we look towards fiscal year 2023, we expect cash capital expenditures to be in line with our target model, within the range of 8% to 10% of total revenue. Total gross capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3.2 billion. Regarding Flash CapEx, we remain excited about our technology road map despite what is clearly a volatile period in the memory industry. As we have discussed on prior calls, BiCS6 is more capital intensive technology node that will require an increase in capital expenditures. Our CapEx outlook for fiscal year 2023 reflects our commitment to technology leadership and will accelerate our path to leapfrog from BiCS6 to BiCS+ in the next several years. I am also pleased to share that the Flash JV Fab 7 manufacturing facility at Yokkaichi plant has been approved to receive a subsidy of up to JPY92.9 billion from the Japanese government, further demonstrating the strategic importance of what is the world's largest NAND manufacturing facility. Given the macro environment, we continue to actively manage our capital expenditures and supply. We are in discussion with our joint venture partner to adjust capital investments and align our production growth with demand. In HDD, we will continue to focus our capital spending primarily in heads and media in order to meet the future growth in cloud demand. Offsetting these investments, we are taking aggressive actions to restructure our client HDD manufacturing footprint. We strive to optimize free cash flow generation in response to the macroeconomic dynamics. For our fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 27.5% and 29.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 30% in the first quarter and for fiscal year 2023. This increase is due to the tax law changes that became effective for our fiscal year 2023, requiring the capitalization of certain R&D expenses that were previously eligible for immediate deduction from taxable income. These changes are expected to result in an immediate increase in our tax rate of approximately 12 percentage points, which will then decrease gradually over time. We expect earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.65 in the first quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. In summary, we continue to believe that we have built the right foundation for long-term growth. We have reignited our innovation, established discipline in spending and investment and remain consistent in deleveraging our balance sheet. The innovation engine that drives TCO benefits and value to our customers, the multiple channels to deliver our products to market and the large and growing storage markets put us in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the proliferation of intelligent devices and rapidly accelerating data creation. While segments of our end markets are now going through an aggressive inventory adjustment as supply chain impacts of the pandemic start to ease and the macro economy softens, secular demand for storage continues to be strong and underpins the digital transformation that continues across all industries. I also want to thank our employees for their hard work during the fiscal year. Despite ongoing geopolitical and macro challenges, our team worked together to deliver strong financial performance for Western Digital. I am proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in the next fiscal year. All right. Peter, with that, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call.  And today's first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first off, just want to clarify here. In terms of what's driving the weakness, is it safe to say that it's entirely consumer client and that on the hyperscale and enterprise side you're not seeing any changes? And as part of that, as you think about this inventory correction on the consumer client side, how long do you think the duration will last? Is this a one-quarter phenomenon? Too early to tell? Would love to hear your thoughts there.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hi C.J., good morning. Yes, I would say, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve pretty much got it right. The one thing I would add to that on the Cloud side is, we are seeing some inventory digestion in China cloud. The US hyperscalers continue to chug along. But especially in the PC OEMs is where we saw it first, a very sharp inventory correction really in the current quarter, taking down their demand significantly to reset their inventory for what is the reality for the number of unit sales. So right now, we think that is a relatively short period of time. Is it one quarter, two quarter, we'll see that as we go through the quarter, but it's definitely very, very sharp in the quarter we're in. And then in the smartphone market, we're seeing it as well. As a matter of fact, it's even developing within the quarter. Just a couple of weeks ago, we had one of our biggest customers take down their forecast in the quarter by over $150 million. So -- and it's all like the message, very strong message we're getting directly from our customers, this is just resetting inventory. So that one, we expect to be a one-quarter phenomena. I think in a larger market, we'll see over the next couple of quarters. I will say that in the consumer and channel space, given our broad reach and where we operate around the world in the consumer business, we are starting to see some stabilization of those markets. Our channel business, if you look at sell-through for the first 4 weeks of the quarter, has been on plan. And even some regions like Europe, we're starting to see some strength. And I would say consumer is pretty much in the same place, starting to stabilize, not great growth yet, but that part of the market looks better than it did, let's say, two months ago. And it's really the OEMs that are really in a rapid and significant correction of inventory as well as, as I said, some of the cloud business in China.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. And just a follow-up question on the NAND side of the house. You talked about rising cap intensity at BiCS6 and what's next. But at the same time, it sounds like you're talking about tempering investments at the JV. So could you walk through how you're thinking about forward CapEx given the changes you're seeing in the end markets?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah, I'll make a few comments and Wissam can comment as well. But we've always known that BiCS6 was going to be a more capital intensive node. I mean, again, we're coming off of a BiCS5, which is the most capital efficient node in the history of the -- our road map, so that's not surprising. And we're driving through that transition. We feel very good about the node. It's just it's a more capital intensive note. Now I will note, as we talked extensively about our Investor Day, our capital intensity in general per bit is the best in the industry, and that's something we really strive for in our road map. So when we're talking about a more capital intensive node, remember, that's a relative issue. We're still in the best position as far as capital per additional bit, and that's a very, very big focus of ours. Now the more macro question is, we're obviously having conversations across the JV about resetting our bit growth in general, independent of node, given the reality of what the demand environment is. Overall, bit demand is coming down. We're in an oversupply environment, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demand driven oversupply, it's not a supply driven oversupply. But we'll reset. We're looking at our CapEx. And we'll make adjustments given what the current situation is. Wissam?\nWissam Jabre: Yeah. If I can add, C.J. The -- we're targeting our cash CapEx per our target model, which is 8% to 10% of revenue. But, of course, as the macro conditions develop, if we need to adjust to that, we will manage dynamically.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks guys. Good morning. So I've got a couple of questions, if I can as well. I just -- I wanted to unpack a little bit more the implied Flash revenue expectation you're making this quarter. With hard disk drive revenue being flat roughly sequentially, it looks like you're talking about a high 20% or 30% sequential decline in the NAND revenue this quarter, the Flash revenue. With that in mind, I mean, how are you guys thinking about bit shift versus what is your assumption around pricing baked into that expectation? I'm just trying to understand, is this more pricing versus bit shipped? And is this really kind of -- do you think that this guide represents a bottom here?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah. I think the way to think about it, as I said earlier, it's kind of a demand driven situation where we're just seeing are biggest customer, and really not all of our customers across the PC space, just resetting inventory and really dropping their demand in the quarter, so they can reset their inventory. So that leads to pricing pressure and volume pressure, so it's both of them. And so as we work through the quarter and they get their inventory to where they need it to, then I think we'll see some of the volume come back as we work through this. From some of our customers, I have more confidence that this is a one-quarter change. But other ones, I think it may take a little longer than that. So we'll see -- we'll have more information as we work through the quarter and we'll be talking about that through the quarter in the appropriate forums. As I said before, I will point out, I mean, this is a very dynamic market. I mean this is -- some of this has happened in the quarter. So it's very difficult to bound this, but we think we're very -- we're confident in the guide, don't get me wrong. But I'm happy we guided when we did because the -- it's a very, very dynamic environment out there. But I think our customers are aggressively managing their inventory. And my sense is they'll get through it in a pretty expeditious fashion. Like I said in the prepared remarks, we've got kind of the supply chain is loosening up. We're getting more components. I think our customers are getting more components. Maybe that's giving them more confidence in how they manage their own inventory. And at the same time, we're going into a softer economy. So everybody is in a big reset and it's especially impacting the Flash business, to your point. The HDD business still get consistent strong growth out of the hyperscalers in the US, and feel very, very good about the portfolio position there and what we're going to drive throughout the fiscal year.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And as a quick follow-up, just thinking about the Flash business a little bit more. These last couple of quarters, and appreciating that mix is a factor, but these last couple of quarters, it looks like you've seen a little bit of a slowing of your ability to drive cost down in the Flash business. As we think about BiCS6, how are you thinking about the relative cost down structure of BiCS6 relative to BiCS5? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah. I mean the -- as we've talked about cost downs, we target 15%. We always know there's going to be some quarters below, some above. Hopefully, there's more on the favorable side, and I think that's been the history, but we've hit a couple of quarters where that's not the case. But if you look at our fiscal year, we delivered right at the 15%, I think, even a tick over. Is that right, Wissam?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, that's correct, David. And one of the things to keep in mind, Aaron, is we did have the fab contamination in the third fiscal quarter. And so this is why -- this is partly why we haven't seen necessarily the same cadence of cost reduction in the last couple of quarters of the fiscal 2022.\nDavid Goeckeler: So Aaron, we feel really good about the BiCS6 transition and what that's going to bring. And I think you'll see in the upcoming quarters, the costs will get back to where we expect it to be. We explicitly drive our road map around this number. We explicitly drive the nodal transition and the road map development around making sure we can deliver the 15% year-over-year and we are very pleased that we just delivered it again in the last fiscal year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could address, I mean, I didn't hear a specific answer to volume versus prices in NAND in Q3, but I guess what is your inventory balance going to look like at the end of Q3? And I know in the past, you guys have been willing to take fab utilization adjustments to keep that number under control. Have you thought about that in this environment?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah. I'll make a few comments. I'll let Wissam make a few comments. And we don't guide to that level of specificity, but they're both roughly down about the same.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. That's where the numbers shape up, roughly among the same.\nJoe Moore: And your inventory balance?\nWissam Jabre: Well, given that this is mostly demand driven, we expect inventory to be -- to grow a bit this quarter as the supply is higher than the -- where the demand is. However, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are in discussions with our JV partners to take appropriate action if -- to the extent we can to limit that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please, go ahead.\nPatrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow-up on the HDD side, taking it on the positive end, Dave, maybe if you could give a little color on your confidence level on the sustainability of the US hyperscalers' spending trends. What gives you the confidence that this will at least carry through the second half of this year and maybe into the early parts of 2023?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, a couple of things. One is the message we get from them -- obviously, we have a very, very close relationship and talk on a daily basis. And so the message we get in planning for the second half continues to be a strong and consistent message. We've got a great portfolio around 22 and 26 and SMR. I think one of the big highlights of last quarter on the HDD side is we got a second hyperscaler that fully qualified SMR. And with our position with UltraSMR getting 20% more out of a drive puts us in a great position for that transition. So it continues to be a very, very consistent message from them about how they plan to consume the product in the second half and going into next year. And like I said, from the portfolio point of view, we've got lots of new qualifications underway on 22 terabytes CMR, 26 terabyte SMR. And as we go through the fiscal year, you'll see all of those products start to ramp and be adopted at volume.\nPatrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question, in terms of following up from your Analyst Day where you did put a big focus on the NAND flash moving to the SSD market for the Cloud segment itself as well. Do you see this shift beginning with BiCS6, or is this more of a BiCS+ type of endeavor where it will be future generations where you see the biggest shift towards SSD NAND?\nDavid Goeckeler: No. I mean, the shift is happening now. I mean, we just delivered a quarter of 105% sequential growth on our enterprise SSD portfolio. Now that's a particularly strong result. But we're very confident that as we work through the next couple of years, we're going to drive our share of enterprise SSD from the 8% to 16%. We've got a very good plan for that. It's a great market to participate in. Like I said, we broke through with the qualifications and the success has been strong. Now it will be lumpy, not every quarter is going to be up. But the trajectory over the three-year time span is we have a lot of confidence, we're going to drive that to the 16% share in FY 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, before we go to our next question, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question in the interest of time. Today's next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. You're basically shipping well below demand levels, given the inventory correction when you look at the September quarter. Can you maybe help quantify that and help us think through if the digestion that you're calling for is completed, let's say, in September, what's roughly the right base we should be thinking of to drive any sequential growth off of that in -- for the December quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean, for -- in the PC market, we think the market is -- there was consensus earlier in the year of maybe 325 million units. We think that's going to land more around 305 million units. So, that gives you a sense of the correction that's happening aggressively right now. And we saw -- I think we talked about smartphone demand being down single-digits, mid-single-digits on a unit percentage. So I think, Wamsi, we're just going through this very sharp step-down right now where everybody resets their inventory, especially as they have -- I personally think, as they have more confidence, that the inventory -- the supply chain is loosening up. It's not completely loosened up, there's still tight areas. But in general, we're able to get more upsides on products that -- components that even a couple of quarters ago were very tight. So, I think everybody is kind of resetting for that world and they're resetting going into a softer consumer environment. So, I think that gives you a little bit to bracket how we're thinking about it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. So, looking at your Flash margins, they are still at a pretty decent level in the June quarter, but obviously that will come down in the September quarter. But with margins coming down into, let's say, the next few quarters given where the pricing is heading, do you think your margins will get back to that last trough in 2019 when it was below 20%? Obviously, pricing is out of your control, but are there things in your control that you will make the mix trough be better than the last one? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I mean I think that we've done a tremendous amount of work on the portfolio in the last couple of years, and I think that's is going to show up. And the way we think about through-cycle margin, we talked a lot about this at the -- our Investor Day, we're managing for through-cycle margin. We want to drive the higher lows and higher highs. And we think we're set up well to do that given the qualifications across enterprise SSD. Our very strong position in gaming, that's been a great market for us and a growth area just over the last year and a half. So, yes, I think it's -- I think we go into this situation with a lot better portfolio and a lot better diversity, a lot more places to put our supply, and we think that's going to lead to a better result.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a multipart question on your HDD business, primarily around utilization rates and CapEx and the restructuring plan that you talked about. In terms of utilization rates, your nearest competitor talked about making some adjustments in the near term. Is that something that you guys are thinking about or doing in HDD? And on the CapEx side, what's contemplated in your fiscal 2023 outlook, again, as it pertains to your hard drive business? And then on the restructuring, I was hoping you could expand on what exactly you're doing, how much capacity is coming online over the next -- in the medium to long-term? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks Toshiya. So, let me just add a little context and, Wissam, give a little more detail on CapEx and how we're thinking about this. So, as we talked about that the client HDD market has been interesting over the last couple of years. We went into the pandemic and we saw a big surge in demand for client hard drives. Just in general, we saw a big surge in demand for PCs. That has turned around dramatically. And what we're seeing right now is that business is down over 50% year-over-year. So we're seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's returning to pre-pandemic trajectory, and even going down faster than that now as far as the transition to flash happens. That's a good transition for us, because we have such a great portfolio in client SSD. So we've been playing that transition for years. But it really calls for us to reset our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how much client HDD capacity we have in the system, and that's what we're aggressively undertaking right now.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So on that, Toshiya, on the restructuring, we're basically, as David said, we're taking \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we're reducing our manufacturing footprint on the client side. And the expectation is this should benefit us from a couple of areas, a little bit on the CapEx side, but also in terms of the cost of goods sold. And so if there's any underutilization that was associated with that or would have been associated with that part of the manufacturing capacity, it's being basically managed out. And so that should help us be able to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we sort of said, in terms of the gross margin transition for the HDD business from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we're expecting it to be more or less flat. And so based on that, we should probably see even further improvements in the following quarters.\nDavid Goeckeler : On CapEx.\nWissam Jabre: And on CapEx, we typically don't break out the CapEx between HDD and Flash. But as I said, we do plan to stay within our target model of the 8% to 10% of revenue. And if you recall at Investor Day, I did say that the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we typically \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we would like to get to a point where for the HDD business we target 4% to 6%, maybe higher than this, in the near term simply because we are investing in the capacity enterprise side of the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of the manufacturing of the house. The one thing though to keep in mind is, we are keeping a close eye to the supply-demand situation, and we do not plan to be investing or building overcapacity short term to be able to maintain that supply-demand balance.\nDavid Goeckeler: So Toshiya, just a few more comments on this so we fully paint the picture. So you're really starting to see this, what we talked about at our Analyst Day. In heads and media, we still have to invest. I mean there's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we need \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these big drives have a lot of heads in them, so we're still investing in heads. Media, we transition to capacity enterprise. But we just have the manufacturing ability to produce millions and millions of client drives that we don't need anymore. So that's the part we're resetting, and to get that cost out of the system.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Tom O'Malley of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTom O'Malley: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to look at the overall business. Obviously, you've talked about the moving parts into September. But could you talk about when you think you might see the total top line start to recover? I know, there's a lot of moving parts. I know, there's not a ton of visibility right now. But obviously, from a net income pro forma earnings perspective, do you guys see yourselves making losses in the coming quarters? And just if you do, can you talk about the depth in which you're kind of planning for that based on recessionary scenario? Just any color on where you might see this bottom from a total company perspective? Thank you. \nDavid Goeckeler: So first off, we don't see losses, no. So, look, you hit on it. It's just very dynamic right now. Let me paint the picture and Wissam can say, maybe a little bit about the out quarters. We're seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would say, if we went back several quarters, we started talking about it very early this year. The consumer started softening really in Europe when the war broke out, in China with the lockdowns and that progressed throughout the first half of the year. The consumer business is something that usually is soft. It's seasonally the weakest part of the year. April and May, calendar Q2 is an interesting quarter for that business because it always starts off in April and May and comes on strong in June, that really didn't happen. It stayed soft. And then we started to see the spread into consumer -- consumers purchasing PCs and now smartphones. And so, now we're seeing the OEMs and the PC and the smartphone business, as we talked about, very aggressively reset their inventory levels. At the same time, we're starting to see the consumer in our channel business, stabilize. So, we're starting to see the early signs of the consumer business stabilizing, the channel business, stabilizing. If I look at sell-through for the first part of the quarter, it was to plan. Sell-in, it's still a little bit behind because nobody wants to build inventory right now. But sell-through has stabilized. And in some regions, like I said, in Europe, we're even seeing Q-over-Q growth in the channel. So it all depends on how we get -- how fast we get through the inventory correction on the OEM side. And then just to cap that off, in the cloud, we continue to see very consistent demand from the US hyperscalers and we see some digestion in China cloud. And we expect that digestion in China cloud to work its way through this quarter. In general, China has been, I think the word I would say, has been quiet across all the markets. There's not a lot of visibility. We'll see how that comes back throughout the quarter. But that gives you a little bit of kind of the evolution of how we've seen this and kind of how we see it going forward, as I said. Although the PC and the OEMs are going through \u00e2\u0080\u0093 PC and smartphone OEMs are going through very, very sharp correction, we are seeing other parts of the market start to stabilize. So, I don't know, Wissam, you want to add that up? We don't really forecast the out quarters, but anything to say about that?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. I mean we don't forecast the out quarters. We don't see losses. The one \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the couple of points I would add to that, David, is we obviously are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with this down cycle, we're starting from a much, much stronger financial position. We've done a lot over the last couple of years to strengthen our financial position. We also launched a very exciting set of products last quarter. So, we have really a very strong portfolio. We have good additions to the leadership team. And so, we're in a much better position to manage through this.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. \nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I also had a two-part question is on HDD gross margin. And you're still running a couple of hundred basis points lower than your peer. And I'm wondering if you can sort of unpack that. Is this related to the client capacity that you're trying to take out? And then on the NAND side, you answered a prior question saying that -- I think you're implying that the decline is roughly equal between bits and pricing. And I just want to clarify, is that what you meant to say? Because if that's the case, then bits are certainly -- well, I mean, both bits and pricing are down more than your peers. So I'm just wondering if you can sort of handicap why your NAND business is performing worse than your peers. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: So on HDD, I think -- I think the gap in gross margin is now 100 basis points. But first of all, I feel good about the quarter we had on gross margin. We expected -- we expected -- well, let's put it this way. We're able to get the gross margins up in HDD a little faster than we thought. When we talked about last quarter, we thought they would start going up sequentially going into the second half, and we were able to pull some of that back into calendar Q2, our fiscal Q4. That was due to a number of things. One is pricing continues to be pretty benign to even up a little bit, which is something we've been -- I think the industry has been striving for, again, given all the innovation we're bringing to market. And then we were able to work some on the cost side as well. Us versus our competitors, remember, everybody has a different mix. And they -- there are some markets, especially the performance enterprise markets that Western Digital exited a number of years ago, and that's a declining but margin-rich part of the HDD market that we don't participate in. But in general, from a margin perspective, on HDD, I get back to innovation, the portfolio, the 22-terabyte drive, the 26-terabyte UltraSMR drives, those are in a unique position in the industry. And we have a plan as we move through FY 2023. Those will become bigger and bigger and, in fact, the predominant part of the portfolio and what we're shipping as we move through the year. So I think that sets us up in a very strong position to have a really good TCO conversation with our customers as we continue to drive innovation. Second part of your question was in Flash. Again, this is a very dynamic market. Things have changed even in the last week and half to two weeks. So I think that we're at a different point of when we're forecasting and we are rolling in everything we have heard from our customers. As I said, we have customers that have very, very significant amounts of demand that are changing within the quarter. So we put a guide around that. Obviously, we'll work to make that better, but that's the reality of where the business is today.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's final question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. David, I just wanted to follow up to the last comment. You highlighted earlier in the call that you remain comfortable with near-line cloud demand, especially in North America. And then you just said that demand is very volatile. What gives you confidence that the North American cloud service providers go through inventory digestion later this year and into next year? Is there anything that you can share with us? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: I think it's just our deep relationship with them and the conversation we have. We also have multi-quarter agreements with a lot of these customers, which gives us more visibility into what their plans are. We're, obviously, in deep conversations with them about our next generation products, which is very exciting. We're able to bring a market-leading capacity points to them across CMR and SMR. So, again, 22-terabyte CMR is a unique product in the industry. And then we have 26-terabyte SMR, which is, again, a unique product in the industry. Nobody else can go to those capacity points. And so, we feel very good about where the portfolio is. Those are being adopted and qualified across our customer base. I think the strength of where we're at in the TCO equation we bring to our customers, as well as the visibility that we see and given the relationship gives us confidence as we move through the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results. I'm pleased that the Western Digital team executed well and delivered solid results in light of the ongoing macro and geopolitical dynamics. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 32% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78, all within the guidance ranges we provided in April. Fiscal year 2022 revenue totaled $18.8 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.22. This compares to revenue of $16.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.55 in fiscal year 2021. We grew revenue 11% and EPS increased 81%, demonstrating progress in unlocking the earnings potential of our business. In addition to strong financial performance, fiscal year 2022 was a hallmark year for Western Digital from an innovation, product development and execution perspective. In particular, we regained innovation leadership with the introduction of multiple products and technologies for the cloud. In May, we announced a 26-terabyte drive, leveraging our OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies as well as ePMR. Impressively, this means we've nearly doubled drive capacity relative to when I joined Western Digital just over two years ago. In Flash, we expanded adoption of our NVMe enterprise SSD from one cloud titan to three as well as qualification at several enterprise OEM suppliers. From an organization perspective, we have bolstered the company's executive management team, further strengthening our ability to drive operational excellence, innovation and disciplined financial management. On top of all of these achievements, we reduced debt by $1.7 billion and attained an investment-grade corporate rating, placing Western Digital on a solid financial foundation. Before I jump into additional detail on the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our strategic review. As you know, two months ago, we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing long-term value for our shareholders. The Executive Committee of the Board, which I lead, continues to oversee the review and Elliott Management is participating alongside us under a non-disclosure agreement, along with other interested parties. We're evaluating a range of alternatives, including options for separating our market-leading Flash and HDD franchises. We are moving expeditiously, but this work will take time. We will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today giving -- given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process. We will provide updates in the future as appropriate. Now I'll provide updates on our HDD and Flash businesses. During the fiscal fourth quarter, strong demand from our cloud customers for our latest generation energy-assisted drives drove near-record near-line shipments of 111 exabytes. Total HDD revenue declined sequentially due primarily to consumer and client HDD demand. We commenced commercial shipment of a number of products incorporating our OptiNAND technology. In addition to shipments of our 20- terabyte and 22-terabyte CMR drives, qualifications of our 26-terabyte SMR drive are underway, as we noted at our product launch event in May. This SMR-enabled drive enables 20% higher capacity than our CMR variants, offering significantly better TCO for our cloud customers and further highlighting the performance-driven benefits of the innovation that Western Digital is packing into a hard drive. Finally, we are ramping a second cloud customer with SMR technology this quarter and remain on track to lead the industry's transition to SMR-based drives for the cloud. We are very confident in our multiyear product roadmap for capacity enterprise drives, which combine ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR and triple-stage actuators to deliver a cutting-edge portfolio of drives in commercial volumes at a wide variety of capacity points. We also continue to invest in HAMR and the commercialization of this technology alongside our other HDD technologies that are leading the industry. The breadth and depth of this portfolio strongly positions us to be the provider of choice for the largest and most complex data centers in the world. Building on the expertise cultivated over decades of bringing to market industry-leading technologies, we are committed to leveraging our innovations to continue driving business results in capacity enterprise into the future. Turning to Flash. Revenue grew sequentially on an improving product mix and increased flash supply. Growth in Flash during the quarter came primarily from enterprise SSD, with revenue more than doubling sequentially. Gaming is another key growth market for us, where we continue to demonstrate the strength of our client SSD franchise with exabyte shipment growing nearly 70% year-over-year. We have a leading position in gaming with our WD_BLACK brand being recognized globally for innovation, performance and quality. The latest example of this is our WD_BLACK SN-850 NVMe SSD product certified for Sony PS5 game consoles, which enables players to expand the high-speed storage capacity of their PS5 console and allows them to store and play both PS5 and PS4 games directly from the drive. On the technology front, BiCS5 represented about half of our Flash revenue in the June quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter. We are preparing to ramp BiCS6 late this calendar year and into 2023. Based on circuit under array architecture, BiCS6 enables many exciting high-performance products for 5G phones, SSDs and QLC flash. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In the cloud end market, we experienced strength in the fiscal fourth quarter as supply constraints at Western Digital and our end customers started to ease. Overall, demand from our cloud customers has been consistently strong and we expect this strength in cloud to carry into the second half of calendar year 2022. We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive cloud growth and believe we are on track to generate about half of our revenue from this market by fiscal year 2025. Outside of cloud, our expectations for calendar year 2022 demand growth have moderated since our last earnings call. As the fiscal fourth quarter progressed, we saw consumer spending soften, impacting both retail Flash and HDD demand. This weakness has migrated to the consumer PC end market as we enter the second half of the calendar year. In client, the market generally expect PC shipments to decline approximately 10% in calendar year 2022. We are seeing our PC OEM customers aggressively rightsize their inventory to reflect current demand conditions, which will impact our business in this market in the second half of the calendar year. After going through that correction, we expect a more normal flow of business going forward as we believe PCs will continue to fulfill broader use cases as the foundation of the increasingly common hybrid enterprise, driving unit demand above pre-pandemic levels in richer SSD content. All of these PC market dynamics are accelerating the final phase of the shift of client devices from HDD to flash technology. Consequently, the client HDD market is now declining at an accelerated rate relative to the period before the onset of the pandemic. To reflect this reality, we are now taking aggressive action to restructure our HDD manufacturing footprint to reflect this market dynamic. In mobile, expectations for smartphone units have come down in recent months, led primarily by reduced demand in China. Industry analysts expect the smartphone industry unit volume to decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year in calendar 2022. While we are well-positioned in supplying flash memory for 5G smartphones, we are also seeing our largest customers aggressively resetting their inventories for these products. We expect the inventory correction to be primarily impact our fiscal first quarter and return to market demand for the remainder of the fiscal year. In consumer, we have a premium brand and a great franchise in the marketplace. In particular, we have developed an enviable position and excellent relationships with major brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers across the globe, including Best Buy and Target in the US, MSH Group in Europe, JD.com in China and Officeworks in Australia. As a result of these strong relationships, our impressive scale, product breadth and trusted brand, we lead most consumer storage product categories. While macroeconomic factors and COVID measures have impacted consumer demand in the near term, our customers' loyalty and preference for the performance and quality of our solutions are key differentiators, which will position Western Digital well, for the upcoming back-to-school and holiday seasons. Before turning the call over to Wissam, I want to leave you with a few takeaways. First, at the Investor Day, we laid out the case, where the world of ever-increasing intelligent devices powered by the cloud is creating an astonishing amount of data, of which only a small percentage is stored. Our conviction remains strong and our view on near double-digit revenue growth remains intact. Over the past several years, the storage market has entered an era of accelerated growth, led by the strength of the cloud market, which drove HDD revenue growth for Western Digital and the industry. In Flash, capital investments for incremental NAND bit growth are becoming more expensive, resulting in a more disciplined investment across the industry. At Western Digital, our long-standing and growing relationships with hyperscale and OEM customers across the world, coupled with our leadership in commercializing innovations for capacity enterprise hard drives and momentum with NVMe enterprise SSD for data center, has made us a trusted partner. This combination of rapid demand growth in storage, technology leadership and product momentum offer Western Digital opportunities for financial outperformance. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results and provide an outlook for the fiscal first quarter. Thanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. In summary, we continue to believe that we have built the right foundation for long-term growth. We have reignited our innovation, established discipline in spending and investment and remain consistent in deleveraging our balance sheet. The innovation engine that drives TCO benefits and value to our customers, the multiple channels to deliver our products to market and the large and growing storage markets put us in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the proliferation of intelligent devices and rapidly accelerating data creation. While segments of our end markets are now going through an aggressive inventory adjustment as supply chain impacts of the pandemic start to ease and the macro economy softens, secular demand for storage continues to be strong and underpins the digital transformation that continues across all industries. I also want to thank our employees for their hard work during the fiscal year. Despite ongoing geopolitical and macro challenges, our team worked together to deliver strong financial performance for Western Digital. I am proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in the next fiscal year. All right. Peter, with that, let's open it up for Q&A. Hi C.J., good morning. Yes, I would say, youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ve pretty much got it right. The one thing I would add to that on the Cloud side is, we are seeing some inventory digestion in China cloud. The US hyperscalers continue to chug along. But especially in the PC OEMs is where we saw it first, a very sharp inventory correction really in the current quarter, taking down their demand significantly to reset their inventory for what is the reality for the number of unit sales. So right now, we think that is a relatively short period of time. Is it one quarter, two quarter, we'll see that as we go through the quarter, but it's definitely very, very sharp in the quarter we're in. And then in the smartphone market, we're seeing it as well. As a matter of fact, it's even developing within the quarter. Just a couple of weeks ago, we had one of our biggest customers take down their forecast in the quarter by over $150 million. So -- and it's all like the message, very strong message we're getting directly from our customers, this is just resetting inventory. So that one, we expect to be a one-quarter phenomena. I think in a larger market, we'll see over the next couple of quarters. I will say that in the consumer and channel space, given our broad reach and where we operate around the world in the consumer business, we are starting to see some stabilization of those markets. Our channel business, if you look at sell-through for the first 4 weeks of the quarter, has been on plan. And even some regions like Europe, we're starting to see some strength. And I would say consumer is pretty much in the same place, starting to stabilize, not great growth yet, but that part of the market looks better than it did, let's say, two months ago. And it's really the OEMs that are really in a rapid and significant correction of inventory as well as, as I said, some of the cloud business in China. Yeah, I'll make a few comments and Wissam can comment as well. But we've always known that BiCS6 was going to be a more capital intensive node. I mean, again, we're coming off of a BiCS5, which is the most capital efficient node in the history of the -- our road map, so that's not surprising. And we're driving through that transition. We feel very good about the node. It's just it's a more capital intensive note. Now I will note, as we talked extensively about our Investor Day, our capital intensity in general per bit is the best in the industry, and that's something we really strive for in our road map. So when we're talking about a more capital intensive node, remember, that's a relative issue. We're still in the best position as far as capital per additional bit, and that's a very, very big focus of ours. Now the more macro question is, we're obviously having conversations across the JV about resetting our bit growth in general, independent of node, given the reality of what the demand environment is. Overall, bit demand is coming down. We're in an oversupply environment, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s demand driven oversupply, it's not a supply driven oversupply. But we'll reset. We're looking at our CapEx. And we'll make adjustments given what the current situation is. Wissam? Yeah. I think the way to think about it, as I said earlier, it's kind of a demand driven situation where we're just seeing are biggest customer, and really not all of our customers across the PC space, just resetting inventory and really dropping their demand in the quarter, so they can reset their inventory. So that leads to pricing pressure and volume pressure, so it's both of them. And so as we work through the quarter and they get their inventory to where they need it to, then I think we'll see some of the volume come back as we work through this. From some of our customers, I have more confidence that this is a one-quarter change. But other ones, I think it may take a little longer than that. So we'll see -- we'll have more information as we work through the quarter and we'll be talking about that through the quarter in the appropriate forums. As I said before, I will point out, I mean, this is a very dynamic market. I mean this is -- some of this has happened in the quarter. So it's very difficult to bound this, but we think we're very -- we're confident in the guide, don't get me wrong. But I'm happy we guided when we did because the -- it's a very, very dynamic environment out there. But I think our customers are aggressively managing their inventory. And my sense is they'll get through it in a pretty expeditious fashion. Like I said in the prepared remarks, we've got kind of the supply chain is loosening up. We're getting more components. I think our customers are getting more components. Maybe that's giving them more confidence in how they manage their own inventory. And at the same time, we're going into a softer economy. So everybody is in a big reset and it's especially impacting the Flash business, to your point. The HDD business still get consistent strong growth out of the hyperscalers in the US, and feel very, very good about the portfolio position there and what we're going to drive throughout the fiscal year. Yeah. I mean the -- as we've talked about cost downs, we target 15%. We always know there's going to be some quarters below, some above. Hopefully, there's more on the favorable side, and I think that's been the history, but we've hit a couple of quarters where that's not the case. But if you look at our fiscal year, we delivered right at the 15%, I think, even a tick over. Is that right, Wissam? So Aaron, we feel really good about the BiCS6 transition and what that's going to bring. And I think you'll see in the upcoming quarters, the costs will get back to where we expect it to be. We explicitly drive our road map around this number. We explicitly drive the nodal transition and the road map development around making sure we can deliver the 15% year-over-year and we are very pleased that we just delivered it again in the last fiscal year. Yeah. I'll make a few comments. I'll let Wissam make a few comments. And we don't guide to that level of specificity, but they're both roughly down about the same. Yes, a couple of things. One is the message we get from them -- obviously, we have a very, very close relationship and talk on a daily basis. And so the message we get in planning for the second half continues to be a strong and consistent message. We've got a great portfolio around 22 and 26 and SMR. I think one of the big highlights of last quarter on the HDD side is we got a second hyperscaler that fully qualified SMR. And with our position with UltraSMR getting 20% more out of a drive puts us in a great position for that transition. So it continues to be a very, very consistent message from them about how they plan to consume the product in the second half and going into next year. And like I said, from the portfolio point of view, we've got lots of new qualifications underway on 22 terabytes CMR, 26 terabyte SMR. And as we go through the fiscal year, you'll see all of those products start to ramp and be adopted at volume. No. I mean, the shift is happening now. I mean, we just delivered a quarter of 105% sequential growth on our enterprise SSD portfolio. Now that's a particularly strong result. But we're very confident that as we work through the next couple of years, we're going to drive our share of enterprise SSD from the 8% to 16%. We've got a very good plan for that. It's a great market to participate in. Like I said, we broke through with the qualifications and the success has been strong. Now it will be lumpy, not every quarter is going to be up. But the trajectory over the three-year time span is we have a lot of confidence, we're going to drive that to the 16% share in FY 2025. Well, I mean, for -- in the PC market, we think the market is -- there was consensus earlier in the year of maybe 325 million units. We think that's going to land more around 305 million units. So, that gives you a sense of the correction that's happening aggressively right now. And we saw -- I think we talked about smartphone demand being down single-digits, mid-single-digits on a unit percentage. So I think, Wamsi, we're just going through this very sharp step-down right now where everybody resets their inventory, especially as they have -- I personally think, as they have more confidence, that the inventory -- the supply chain is loosening up. It's not completely loosened up, there's still tight areas. But in general, we're able to get more upsides on products that -- components that even a couple of quarters ago were very tight. So, I think everybody is kind of resetting for that world and they're resetting going into a softer consumer environment. So, I think that gives you a little bit to bracket how we're thinking about it. Yes, I mean I think that we've done a tremendous amount of work on the portfolio in the last couple of years, and I think that's is going to show up. And the way we think about through-cycle margin, we talked a lot about this at the -- our Investor Day, we're managing for through-cycle margin. We want to drive the higher lows and higher highs. And we think we're set up well to do that given the qualifications across enterprise SSD. Our very strong position in gaming, that's been a great market for us and a growth area just over the last year and a half. So, yes, I think it's -- I think we go into this situation with a lot better portfolio and a lot better diversity, a lot more places to put our supply, and we think that's going to lead to a better result. Thanks Toshiya. So, let me just add a little context and, Wissam, give a little more detail on CapEx and how we're thinking about this. So, as we talked about that the client HDD market has been interesting over the last couple of years. We went into the pandemic and we saw a big surge in demand for client hard drives. Just in general, we saw a big surge in demand for PCs. That has turned around dramatically. And what we're seeing right now is that business is down over 50% year-over-year. So we're seeing a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it's returning to pre-pandemic trajectory, and even going down faster than that now as far as the transition to flash happens. That's a good transition for us, because we have such a great portfolio in client SSD. So we've been playing that transition for years. But it really calls for us to reset our a\u0302\u0080\u0093 how much client HDD capacity we have in the system, and that's what we're aggressively undertaking right now. On CapEx. So Toshiya, just a few more comments on this so we fully paint the picture. So you're really starting to see this, what we talked about at our Analyst Day. In heads and media, we still have to invest. I mean there's a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we need a\u0302\u0080\u0093 these big drives have a lot of heads in them, so we're still investing in heads. Media, we transition to capacity enterprise. But we just have the manufacturing ability to produce millions and millions of client drives that we don't need anymore. So that's the part we're resetting, and to get that cost out of the system. So first off, we don't see losses, no. So, look, you hit on it. It's just very dynamic right now. Let me paint the picture and Wissam can say, maybe a little bit about the out quarters. We're seeing a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I would say, if we went back several quarters, we started talking about it very early this year. The consumer started softening really in Europe when the war broke out, in China with the lockdowns and that progressed throughout the first half of the year. The consumer business is something that usually is soft. It's seasonally the weakest part of the year. April and May, calendar Q2 is an interesting quarter for that business because it always starts off in April and May and comes on strong in June, that really didn't happen. It stayed soft. And then we started to see the spread into consumer -- consumers purchasing PCs and now smartphones. And so, now we're seeing the OEMs and the PC and the smartphone business, as we talked about, very aggressively reset their inventory levels. At the same time, we're starting to see the consumer in our channel business, stabilize. So, we're starting to see the early signs of the consumer business stabilizing, the channel business, stabilizing. If I look at sell-through for the first part of the quarter, it was to plan. Sell-in, it's still a little bit behind because nobody wants to build inventory right now. But sell-through has stabilized. And in some regions, like I said, in Europe, we're even seeing Q-over-Q growth in the channel. So it all depends on how we get -- how fast we get through the inventory correction on the OEM side. And then just to cap that off, in the cloud, we continue to see very consistent demand from the US hyperscalers and we see some digestion in China cloud. And we expect that digestion in China cloud to work its way through this quarter. In general, China has been, I think the word I would say, has been quiet across all the markets. There's not a lot of visibility. We'll see how that comes back throughout the quarter. But that gives you a little bit of kind of the evolution of how we've seen this and kind of how we see it going forward, as I said. Although the PC and the OEMs are going through a\u0302\u0080\u0093 PC and smartphone OEMs are going through very, very sharp correction, we are seeing other parts of the market start to stabilize. So, I don't know, Wissam, you want to add that up? We don't really forecast the out quarters, but anything to say about that? So on HDD, I think -- I think the gap in gross margin is now 100 basis points. But first of all, I feel good about the quarter we had on gross margin. We expected -- we expected -- well, let's put it this way. We're able to get the gross margins up in HDD a little faster than we thought. When we talked about last quarter, we thought they would start going up sequentially going into the second half, and we were able to pull some of that back into calendar Q2, our fiscal Q4. That was due to a number of things. One is pricing continues to be pretty benign to even up a little bit, which is something we've been -- I think the industry has been striving for, again, given all the innovation we're bringing to market. And then we were able to work some on the cost side as well. Us versus our competitors, remember, everybody has a different mix. And they -- there are some markets, especially the performance enterprise markets that Western Digital exited a number of years ago, and that's a declining but margin-rich part of the HDD market that we don't participate in. But in general, from a margin perspective, on HDD, I get back to innovation, the portfolio, the 22-terabyte drive, the 26-terabyte UltraSMR drives, those are in a unique position in the industry. And we have a plan as we move through FY 2023. Those will become bigger and bigger and, in fact, the predominant part of the portfolio and what we're shipping as we move through the year. So I think that sets us up in a very strong position to have a really good TCO conversation with our customers as we continue to drive innovation. Second part of your question was in Flash. Again, this is a very dynamic market. Things have changed even in the last week and half to two weeks. So I think that we're at a different point of when we're forecasting and we are rolling in everything we have heard from our customers. As I said, we have customers that have very, very significant amounts of demand that are changing within the quarter. So we put a guide around that. Obviously, we'll work to make that better, but that's the reality of where the business is today. I think it's just our deep relationship with them and the conversation we have. We also have multi-quarter agreements with a lot of these customers, which gives us more visibility into what their plans are. We're, obviously, in deep conversations with them about our next generation products, which is very exciting. We're able to bring a market-leading capacity points to them across CMR and SMR. So, again, 22-terabyte CMR is a unique product in the industry. And then we have 26-terabyte SMR, which is, again, a unique product in the industry. Nobody else can go to those capacity points. And so, we feel very good about where the portfolio is. Those are being adopted and qualified across our customer base. I think the strength of where we're at in the TCO equation we bring to our customers, as well as the visibility that we see and given the relationship gives us confidence as we move through the second half of the year. All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you spending time with us here early on a Friday morning. Thanks for all the great questions, and we'll look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter."

            "name": "Wissam Jabre",
            "content": "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our expectations, reflecting the resilience and agility of our business model, against such a dynamic macro environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78, within the guidance range we provided in April. For the full fiscal year 2022, revenue was $18.8 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 4.3 percentage points and non-GAAP operating margin increased 5.7 percentage points, as we proactively managed our expenses, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $8.22, up 81% from last year. Turning to our end markets. For the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 46% of total revenue at $2.1 billion, up 18% sequentially and 5% from a year ago. Within Cloud, Western Digital's continued success in leading the industry transition to energy-assisted hard drives drove the growth. The continued ramp of our 18-terabyte and 20-terabyte drives drove a 7% year-over-year increase in nearline HDD revenue. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments increased 9% to 111 exabytes. In Flash, enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled sequentially and was up 38% year-over-year. The client end market represented 36% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, down 5% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, client HDD led the revenue decline, while Flash revenue was roughly flat. Consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.8 billion, down 9% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the revenue decline due to lower HDD retail shipments. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline in retail products across HDD and Flash. For the full fiscal year 2022, Cloud revenue increased 40% year-over-year, led by a 38% increase in nearline HDD. Flash product revenue for enterprise SSD applications more than doubled year-over-year. Client revenue decreased 3% year-over-year as growth in Flash was offset by a 30% decrease in client HDD. Client HDD for PCs and Notebooks represents just mid-single-digit percentage of total HDD revenue exiting the fiscal year. Lastly, consumer revenue decreased 6% for the year, all attributed to a decline in retail HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we reported Flash revenue of $2.4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were up 2% on a blended basis and up slightly on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. HDD revenue of $2.1 billion was flat sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per HDD increased by 19% to $120 as our mix continues to transition towards the cloud. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 10% and average price per unit increased by 24%. As we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. We continue to exert disciplined financial management to drive better results. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.3%, up 60 basis points sequentially and down 60 basis points year-over-year. Our Flash gross margin was 35.9%, up 30 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, growth in enterprise SSD for data center applications led the improvement in gross margin. Our HDD gross margin was 28.2%, up 50 basis points sequentially and down 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $760 million were below our guidance range as we continue to prudently manage our expenses. Operating income was $702 million, representing an 8% increase from the prior quarter and a 15% decrease year-over-year. Our tax rate was 11% for both the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022. Earnings per share was $1.78, compared to $1.65 in the prior quarter, and $2.16 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $295 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $97 million. Operating cash flow was impacted by revenue linearity. The ramp back to normal production output at the flash joint venture, timing of component deliveries to our factories and corporate-related control measures in China contributed to a back-end loaded quarter. Cash, capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment; and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $392 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity. Gross CapEx and cash CapEx for the fiscal year 2022 were $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, below our expectation, as we actively managed our capital investments. We made a $150 million scheduled and discretionary debt repayment. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5 times compared to 2.4 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This amount is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. I'll now provide our view of both HDD and Flash businesses for the fiscal first quarter as well as comments on several key items for fiscal year 2023. For the fiscal first quarter, we expect Flash to lead the sequential revenue decline as our customer's right-size their inventory. We expect a relatively modest decline in overall HDD revenue, primarily driven by client and consumer, with gross margin relatively flat. As we look towards fiscal year 2023, we expect cash capital expenditures to be in line with our target model, within the range of 8% to 10% of total revenue. Total gross capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3.2 billion. Regarding Flash CapEx, we remain excited about our technology road map despite what is clearly a volatile period in the memory industry. As we have discussed on prior calls, BiCS6 is more capital intensive technology node that will require an increase in capital expenditures. Our CapEx outlook for fiscal year 2023 reflects our commitment to technology leadership and will accelerate our path to leapfrog from BiCS6 to BiCS+ in the next several years. I am also pleased to share that the Flash JV Fab 7 manufacturing facility at Yokkaichi plant has been approved to receive a subsidy of up to JPY92.9 billion from the Japanese government, further demonstrating the strategic importance of what is the world's largest NAND manufacturing facility. Given the macro environment, we continue to actively manage our capital expenditures and supply. We are in discussion with our joint venture partner to adjust capital investments and align our production growth with demand. In HDD, we will continue to focus our capital spending primarily in heads and media in order to meet the future growth in cloud demand. Offsetting these investments, we are taking aggressive actions to restructure our client HDD manufacturing footprint. We strive to optimize free cash flow generation in response to the macroeconomic dynamics. For our fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 27.5% and 29.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 30% in the first quarter and for fiscal year 2023. This increase is due to the tax law changes that became effective for our fiscal year 2023, requiring the capitalization of certain R&D expenses that were previously eligible for immediate deduction from taxable income. These changes are expected to result in an immediate increase in our tax rate of approximately 12 percentage points, which will then decrease gradually over time. We expect earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.65 in the first quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Yeah. If I can add, C.J. The -- we're targeting our cash CapEx per our target model, which is 8% to 10% of revenue. But, of course, as the macro conditions develop, if we need to adjust to that, we will manage dynamically. Yes, that's correct, David. And one of the things to keep in mind, Aaron, is we did have the fab contamination in the third fiscal quarter. And so this is why -- this is partly why we haven't seen necessarily the same cadence of cost reduction in the last couple of quarters of the fiscal 2022. Yes. That's where the numbers shape up, roughly among the same. Well, given that this is mostly demand driven, we expect inventory to be -- to grow a bit this quarter as the supply is higher than the -- where the demand is. However, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are in discussions with our JV partners to take appropriate action if -- to the extent we can to limit that. Yes. So on that, Toshiya, on the restructuring, we're basically, as David said, we're taking a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we're reducing our manufacturing footprint on the client side. And the expectation is this should benefit us from a couple of areas, a little bit on the CapEx side, but also in terms of the cost of goods sold. And so if there's any underutilization that was associated with that or would have been associated with that part of the manufacturing capacity, it's being basically managed out. And so that should help us be able to a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as we sort of said, in terms of the gross margin transition for the HDD business from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we're expecting it to be more or less flat. And so based on that, we should probably see even further improvements in the following quarters. And on CapEx, we typically don't break out the CapEx between HDD and Flash. But as I said, we do plan to stay within our target model of the 8% to 10% of revenue. And if you recall at Investor Day, I did say that the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we typically a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we would like to get to a point where for the HDD business we target 4% to 6%, maybe higher than this, in the near term simply because we are investing in the capacity enterprise side of the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 of the manufacturing of the house. The one thing though to keep in mind is, we are keeping a close eye to the supply-demand situation, and we do not plan to be investing or building overcapacity short term to be able to maintain that supply-demand balance. Yes. I mean we don't forecast the out quarters. We don't see losses. The one a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the couple of points I would add to that, David, is we obviously are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 with this down cycle, we're starting from a much, much stronger financial position. We've done a lot over the last couple of years to strengthen our financial position. We also launched a very exciting set of products last quarter. So, we have really a very strong portfolio. We have good additions to the leadership team. And so, we're in a much better position to manage through this."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. We delivered excellent performance in the quarter, with revenue of $4.4 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 31.7%, both of which are at the higher end of our updated guidance ranges we provided in early March. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which exceeded our revised guidance. I am proud of the team's execution as we navigated dynamic geopolitical and macroeconomic environment as well as ongoing supply challenges. On top of that, we successfully managed through a fab contamination event that is now fully resolved. Overall, the Western Digital team did an amazing job of meeting our customers' growing and evolving storage needs. This has all been made possible by the operational and technological improvements we have made over the last couple of years that enable us to unlock the true earnings power of the Western Digital model. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the business outlook for calendar year 2022. We believe the secular demand for storage in our new product ramps in HDD and Flash, combined with the seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year, will drive growth across our end markets. With 40% of the world's data stored on Western Digital products, our innovation powers the global technology ecosystem from consumer devices to the edge to the heart of the cloud. Our vision is to create breakthrough innovation inspired by the convergence of human potential and digital transformation that enables the world to actualize its aspirations. At Western Digital, we have established an admirable position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to develop a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a unique position to capitalize on the promising growth opportunities ahead of us. I'll now turn to an update on our HDD and Flash businesses. Our HDD revenue was as forecast and in line with typical March quarter seasonality led by growth in capacity enterprise drives. Robust demand in the cloud end market for 18- and 20-terabyte drives generated a nearly 40% increase in nearline revenue from the same period last year. Of note, our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments approached high single-digit percentage of total capacity enterprise shipments. During the quarter, qualification of OptiNAND-based hard drives progressed as planned across multiple cloud and OEM customers. Combining OptiNAND with our SMR leadership uniquely positions Western Digital in the marketplace. Putting it all together, we have positioned our innovations in OptiNAND and SMR to drive business results in our capacity enterprise business for the rest of this calendar year and into the future. Our largest cloud customers are aligned with this strategy and are accelerating adoption of SMR products within data centers later this year. We are laser-focused on bringing new cutting-edge features and functions to our products for cloud storage. We will provide more details around these exciting innovations at our Investor Day on May 10. Turning to Flash. Our overall business was impacted by our ability to ship product due to the fab excursion. In light of this event, coupled with the supply chain challenges facing all companies across the industry, I would like to thank our customers and the Western Digital teams for working together diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. From a product perspective, client SSD demand improved in the quarter as our PC OEM customers successfully worked through their own supply chain issues. Gaming is another growth market for us, where we continue to have success with exabyte shipment nearly doubling year-over-year. We have a leading position in the marketplace with our brands, including WD_BLACK, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional, recognized globally for cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. An example of this is our WD_BLACK SN770 SSD product, which leverages our cutting-edge BiCS5 technology, an in-house DRAM-less controller architecture. This SSD product is one of the fastest and best drives available in the market. We have received excellent reviews from tech journalists, which is a great testament to the company's strength in both our BiCS technology leadership and our ability to develop innovative solutions, enabling our customers to unlock the potential of their PCs. Qualifications of BiCS5-based products for client and consumer end markets were largely completed, and we are making great progress in qualifying our next-generation BiCS5 enterprise SSD products. We expect these products to drive revenue growth and mix improvements into the future. Lastly, BiCS5 represented nearly half of the Flash revenue, up from 41% in the previous quarter. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In cloud, we see continued strength in calendar year 2022. The increase in cloud capital investment for data center build-outs is expected to propel growth for our HDD and Flash products in this growing end market. In client, PC end demand growth has been solid for the last 2 years, and we are starting to see some normalization in the PC market. We expect PC unit demand to remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, with the return-to-site trend driving a mix shift towards commercial and enterprise PCs with richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs. In mobile, we have a strong position in 5G phones and we see demand for the latest 5G flagship phones remaining solid, with NAND content doubling from prior generation smartphones. In other emerging applications, demand from gaming and VR/AR devices remains robust. Industry analysts expect VR headset sales to grow at a 47% CAGR over the next couple of years. In consumer, we are experiencing short-term demand weakness outside the U.S. tied to the geopolitical events in Europe, as well as COVID-related lockdowns in China. However, we are confident in the strength of the business as we are entering a seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year with a number of new innovative products. We feel good about the overall demand in calendar year 2022. We are continuing to navigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors I mentioned earlier. While these transitory issues are affecting both revenue and gross margin in the near term, we expect them to subside over time. We are confident that the growth and profitability opportunities in front of us have not changed. In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and unrelenting spirit of our employees that goes into creating our game-changing products. In particular, I want to thank our employees in China for their efforts to work through all the supply chain and logistics challenges during the lockdowns. Before turning the call over to Wissam, I wanted to make a quick announcement that Western Digital and the IRS have reached a tentative agreement to resolve a long-running tax matter, covering the fiscal years 2008 through 2015. With offsetting tax benefits, we expect the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million. While this settlement will result in a previously unforecasted cash payment in fiscal year 2023, it does highlight the work that I and the rest of the Western Digital team have undertaken in the last 2 years to instill strong financial discipline and provide greater financial flexibility upon which we are building a foundation for future growth for the company. Wissam will go into more detail in a minute. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal third quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Wissam?\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal third quarter were better than our revised expectations. Despite the incredibly dynamic macro environment that David discussed, our results reflected the resilience of our business and our ability to continually deliver solid financial performance. In addition, we completed a debt restructuring with our lenders in the March quarter, marking continued success in paying down debt and providing increased financial flexibility and stability. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, down 9% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.65, above the revised guidance range of $1.30 to $1.60 we provided in early March. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of the challenging environment. Turning to our end markets. Cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.8 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 25% from a year ago. Within cloud, Western Digital's leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point and ramp of 20-terabyte drives drove a nearly 40% year-over-year increase in nearline revenue. This growth was partially offset by lower enterprise SSD and smart video hard drive revenues. The client end market represented 40% of total revenue at $1.7 billion, down 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily due to typical seasonality in both Flash for mobile and client hard drives. On a year-over-year basis, growth in Flash was offset by a decline in hard drive. Lastly, Consumer represented 20% of revenue at $0.9 billion, down 17% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline was primarily due to lower retail Flash shipments. The year-over-year decrease was roughly evenly split between hard drive and Flash products. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported Flash revenue of $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. On a blended basis, Flash ASPs were down 1% sequentially. On a like-for-like basis, Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and increased 9% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recognized the majority of the bit supply impact caused by the fab contamination. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $101. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments and average price per hard drive increased by 20% and 22%, respectively. As we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. In the March quarter, total fab contamination charges of $203 million were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Gross margin for the third quarter was 31.7%, down 190 basis points sequentially and up 400 basis points year-over-year, including approximately $59 million in COVID-related expenses. Our Flash gross margin was 35.6%, down 50 basis points sequentially and up 560 basis points year-over-year. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.7%, down 290 basis points sequentially and up 270 basis points year-over-year. Hard drive gross margin included COVID-related impact of approximately $51 million or 240 basis points. Operating expenses of $740 million were below our guidance range as we tightly managed our expenses. Operating income was $650 million, representing a 26% decrease from the prior quarter and a 58% increase year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.65, up from $1.02 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $398 million, and free cash flow was $148 million. Cash and capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, represented a cash outflow of $250 million. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity and expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $2.9 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be around $1.3 billion as we actively manage our overall spending. In the fiscal third quarter, we made a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.25 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.51 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.4x compared to 2.6x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Before discussing our outlook, I wanted to provide some more details on the settlement with the IRS that David mentioned. As previously disclosed in our quarterly SEC filings, the company has been in a significant long-running situation with the IRS regarding taxes owed for fiscal years 2008 through 2015. As you can see in our GAAP statements, we took a tax charge in the fiscal third quarter, primarily based on our latest assessment of the situation. In the last few days, we reached a tentative agreement to settle the transfer pricing issues in dispute. The actual amount to Western Digital will have to pay and exact timing of the payments have not been determined yet. However, we currently expect to make a cash payment in the range of $600 million to $700 million some time in the first half of fiscal 2023. Please note that this is the cash out number. We currently expect that the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million after accounting for certain offsetting tax benefits expected to be recouped over the next 3 years. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we will make a GAAP-only adjustment to the reserve associated with this settlement. You will find additional details in our 10-Q, which we plan to file next week. I'll now provide our view of both hard drive and flash businesses for the fiscal fourth quarter. As we indicated on our last earnings call, we continue to expect hard drive revenue to increase driven by growth in nearline hard drives. We also expect Flash revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth fiscal quarter as our flash supply improves.  For our fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion with sequential revenue growth for both hard drive and flash businesses; we expect gross margin to be between 31% and 33%; we expect operating expenses to be between $770 million and $790 million; interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million; our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the fourth quarter; we expect earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.90 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook for the calendar year as customer demand across our end markets continues to be generally strong. Despite the supply chain challenges and macroeconomic factors we discussed earlier, it is evident that we have the right foundation for long-term growth, the right technology portfolio in place to meet evolving customer needs and the broad routes to market necessary to scale our business. Over the last couple of years, we have planned and executed significant changes to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I'm excited that we are witnessing the positive impacts of those changes. Before I wrap up, I want to remind everyone, we have an Investor Day coming up on May 10, and I look forward to seeing you all there. Let's start the Q&A.\nOperator: . Our first question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse : I guess the question relates to your June quarter outlook. I would love to hear how you're thinking about any kind of ongoing implications to both the NAND contamination issue, what kind of impact that might have on your bit availability. And then secondly, in terms of the China lockdown, the impact on your HDD media side and whether that's pushing out any shipments beyond the June quarter.\nDavid Goeckeler : Hey, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, on the flash side, so first of all, as we said, the flash contamination issue is behind us in the fab. We expect bit growth next quarter. We won't be all the way back, but we'll -- we expect to accelerate from where we were this quarter.  As far as the situation in Penang and China, we did have that facility shut down for a couple of weeks. At the end of last quarter, we've mostly recovered that as far as the -- as being able to meet demand for this quarter. I would say that as a general statement, it's -- I think it's very difficult for everybody to meet what true demand is right now in the market. So between component shortages and the situation in China, it makes it really tough. But I think we were able to navigate through the situation quite well, quite -- frankly, the team there did a fantastic job and has kind of recovered. There were some incremental costs as we saw in the HDD margin line that we didn't expect. But all in all, I think we navigated through the situation fairly well. For the coming quarter, yes, we're still dealing with the situations in China, but we think we'll be able to navigate through, although it is very, very dynamic. But we factored in all the risks into the guide, and we're comfortable with where the number's at. Wissam, anything to add?\nWissam Jabre: Not much, David. I think you've covered it well. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers : I'll stick to 1 as well. I -- just kind of thinking about the gross margin guidance into this next quarter, I think it was 31% to 33%. I was curious if you could help kind of unpack the variables. Maybe give us some color on how you're thinking about the flash gross margin relative to the hard disk drive gross margin. And I guess within hard disk drives, how much COVID-related expenses, are you still embedding? Just any other variables you can help us appreciate on both those 2 segments.\nDavid Goeckeler : So I'll take -- I'll start on it, and Wissam can add. So on the drive business, last quarter, we talked about the 200 basis point to 300 basis point impact that we were expecting. I think we took a little that in this quarter than we had expected. Some of that was some cost we didn't expect, like I just talked about in Shenzhen. I think I said Penang earlier, but Shenzhen. And -- so in that business, looking forward, I think we see it as pretty much -- we've pretty much hit the bottom. We basically see it flat going forward. In the flash business, we expect some acceleration of gross margin given the supply-demand balance situation. So Wissam, anything to add to that?\nWissam Jabre : Yes David, just maybe to follow-on on the comments or Aaron's question with respect to COVID, where we see the COVID costs going into next quarter are expected to be a little bit less than what we've experienced in the fiscal third quarter. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Just following up on the contamination issue. Is the 7 exabyte number that you guys talked about still the right kind of number to think about the lost production? And how does that split across the March and June quarters?\nDavid Goeckeler: Joe, yes, that's still the right number. I mean the team will always work in kind of an evolving situation to see what they can do with the material that we had to take out. But I don't think it will be super material to the numbers. So 7 is a good place to work from. And we haven't split it up over the quarters, but the majority of it we took in the previous quarter.\nJoe Moore : Okay. And your joint venture partner, I don't want to speak for them, but like just in terms of assessing the industry situation, would have lost proportionally the same amount?\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes. I'm not going to speak for them. But we have joint manufacturing facilities, for sure. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.\nPeter Andrew : Patrick, are you there? Why don't we skip over and try to get Patrick back in.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question will go to Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\nTom O'Malley : You're seeing a really -- you're seeing a really strong trend in the HDD pricing side. Is that entirely related to the mix more towards nearline? Or are you seeing any underlying trends in other parts of the business as well? Anything helpful there would be really good.\nDavid Goeckeler : I'll put a much larger frame on it, Tom. I think what's happening, and we see it show up in a number of ways, and there's a lot of COVID implications and costs in it, too. But I just -- I think we're just seeing the industry change from a world where there was always capacity enterprise drives available. Hard drives were available. It was about putting as many as you could in places where you could fill up factories and get good absorption and not have to pay incremental cost for that. That's kind of decline of the client era and the rise of the cloud era. We're pretty much through that, we're in the last legs of it. And I just think you're seeing a lot of industry dynamics change. You're seeing long-term agreements come in much something that last year was kind of a new concept that we were working through. Now it's becoming much more mainstream with our big customers just to give us visibility to making investments in this business. Essentially, we don't have a lot of capacity anymore to shift from client to enterprise and the cloud, and we're having to invest in that, and that's causing the whole industry to shift the way it thinks about this technology and my point of view. I think it starts with we're still driving a strong TCO model for our customers. That's where it all starts. Every generation of technology, we're able to bring down the TCO for our customers. In the past, I think as we did that, the reward for our side of it was more volume, to soak up that capacity. Well, that's not the case anymore. Now we have to invest in new volume, so the industry has to change. So we're bringing a lot of TCO value. And I think you're seeing the industry move to providing more visibility, thinking about value-based pricing more -- and how do we move that value equation in a way that we can continue to drive the TCO down and drive a better pricing environment. So that's the big picture. And then, of course, there's a lot of costs in the system right now and inflation input costs are going up, and we're working through pricing if we can mitigate parts of that. That's happening as well.\nTom O'Malley : Helpful. And if I could just sneak just another quick one in. On the flash side, obviously, you had a lot of disruptions during the quarter. It looks like the implied cost was relatively flat. When you're looking into the out quarter, you're obviously saying gross margins are up. You should see some pricing tailwinds given the industry. But Wissam, maybe any sort of color on the cost versus pricing impact in the quarter. I know you don't like to get specific, but obviously, given the situation, anything would be helpful here to kind of move on the moving pieces.\nWissam Jabre : Yes, of course. Yes, Tom. So we do expect that our long term -- to continue to reach our long-term target of cost reduction, which is 15% year-on-year. The -- we did see a bit of a headwind in the current quarter, but it's really impacted by a few factors that we expect will anticipate in the next couple of quarters. So we saw, for instance, we continue to ramp our BiCS5 technology, as well as just like everybody, we're seeing some inflationary pressure as well as the start-up of our Yokkaichi Fab7. But we still expect for this fiscal year '22 to be at least 15% year-on-year in terms of cost reduction. And as I started with, we do expect to continue to meet that target going forward.\nOperator: Our next question will go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jason on for Tim. So, could you please provide any color on the trajectory of your HDD gross margins through the second half of this year? I'm asking because we're expecting some benefit that we'll get for the -- on the stronger -- likely stronger pricing environment in the end of the first half.\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes. We do expect -- as we talked about last quarter, we're pretty much in the same place, which is we expected the decline we saw this quarter -- we actually expected gross margin to be a little lower next quarter. Now we think that will be flat. And then we expect that to improve in the second half for a number of reasons: Mix, input costs that are changing a bit and also some pricing benefit. So yes, we expect next quarter to be the low and then we expect to improve from there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel.\nPatrick Ho : I apologize before. Dave, maybe if you could give a little bit of color. You gave some very encouraging commentary regarding the data center and cloud spending into the second half of the year. One, are these because of the long-term agreements you're signing with customers? And maybe secondly, along with that question, how do you see the customer base in terms of this transition from 18 to 20? Is it a new set of customers? Or are your 18 customers quickly transitioning over to 20 terabytes?\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes. So let me unpack that a little bit and thanks, Patrick. So -- the -- it's largely the same customers that will move from 18 to 20. I mean I think, as I said earlier, the TCO equation improves as you go -- as you keep driving forward. So it's a very part of what we do. I mean this is -- I talk about innovation a lot around here, and the innovation we've driven around ePMR and now OptiNAND and SMR, those are all things that we layer into our products and allow our customers every time they move a generation forward, they get better TCO equation. So there's reasons to keep moving forward. So that's kind of the way that works a little bit. By the way, we'll come back and talk about SMR a little bit more. We're continuing to see more momentum towards SMR. That is the future of the cloud HDD business, is SMR. All the big players are now moving down that path, which is a technology we've been investing in for quite some time. On your other question on -- look, the LTAs don't drive the spending and the LTAs help smooth out the spending. I think the whole idea with the LTA is to give -- we have a strong relationship with our big customers and to give better visibility 2, 3 quarters out. I've talked about this a lot in the past, the business used to -- if I think back a year ago or 2 years ago when I came into the business, the business was just transacted quarter-to-quarter and even within the quarter. And clearly, given the investments we need to make to continue to drive investments in heads and media to fund -- to fuel the exabyte growth, we're going to need more visibility than that. And so the LTAs have been adopted. And we strike those with our big customers on multi-quarter timeframes, and then we stick to them. And that's been very good as far as smoothing out any ups and downs in builds on their side. And so, as far as the second half environment, our big cloud customers continue to tell us and signal a strong demand environment in the second half of the year. So we'll be excited about driving to them with -- starting with 18 and then transitioning to 20 as we move through the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: It\u2019s  for Krish. For HDDs, when do you expect the crossover between 20 terabytes and 18 terabytes? And can you please tell us if you did see slowdown in the VIA market for HDDs over the last quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes. I would imagine the 20 crossover will be in the second half of the year. I mean we're deep into the 18s right now. I mean, 18 is probably 80% of the portfolio of shipping. So it's the sweet spot of the market. As we move through the year, we'll start to ramp 20. So towards the end of the year, early next year -- we can circle back on a specific date, but that's the way we're thinking about it. The surveillance market, smart video market, that's been soft all year. So we continue to see that with the lockdowns in China. We expect that once that ends, there'll be some snapback and some recovery of pushed out demand there. But right now, given the COVID situation, I think that, that market is not going to change until the COVID situation changes.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if I can squeeze one in. Is surveillance margin accretive?\nDavid Goeckeler : Is it -- margin. I don't think we break out of that level. I don't know, Wissam, do you have a comment on that, or Peter?\nWissam Jabre : Yes. Actually, David, we don't break out down to that level of detail.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho : A couple of short ones on the flash side. How are you thinking about your full year bit shipment growth for calendar '22? I know you don't want to go quarter-by-quarter, but for the full year. And then the follow-up question is gross margin for flash, and you talked about maybe up a little bit for next quarter. Are you actually expecting much price increase? How much is mix a factor? And maybe talk about -- Wissam you talked about the Yokkaichi start-up costs. Can you kind of quantify what that number is?\nDavid Goeckeler : I will let Wissam handle the gross margin question. The bit growth -- look, our bit growth will be down this year. We're not going to put a fund number out there right now. But given the fab excursion, we'll be down this year. And then we'll make it up over the next year or so, a year plus. It will take a while to fully come back to our fair share of bits. Our strategy has been very consistent for a long time. We invest to maintain share. And you see us doing that, including recent fab announcements with Kioxia. Wissam, do you want to talk about gross margin a little bit in flash?\nWissam Jabre : Of course, David. So Sidney, thanks for the question. The -- when we think of the flash business, I think to address maybe the part of the question around the Yokkaichi start-up cost, they're not very significant and actually, they're much lower than the K1 fab start-up, we're talking about really a brownfield expansion here versus a greenfield expansion. To the part of your question with respect to our flash gross margin that's sort of embedded in the guidance. Of course, mix always plays a part in any gross margin, whether it's actual or projected. So -- but as I said earlier, we're still expecting to meet that 15%-plus year-on-year cost reduction for flash in the fiscal year 2022. I hope this helps.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini : Yes. And just as a follow-up to the previous question, how should I think about the impact of FX exchange rate on the flash gross margin?\nWissam Jabre : So maybe I'll -- thanks, Mehdi, for the question. Then maybe I'll just talk about the FX in general. So our approach is we do -- we use a layered hedging approach, which means it's -- there's much more coverage in hedge on the shorter term versus the longer term. And so that smoothens out the impact of FX over time.  And the way also to think of it as any incurred cost within the quarter typically will not really impact the P&L until approximately 90 to 120 days later, given the manufacturing cycle times and lead time for delivery of product. And so the -- whatever we're seeing at least in the past short term in terms of currency fluctuations, will not be that impactful to the numbers. What we saw in -- what we're sort of expecting -- actually, what we saw in this quarter and what we're anticipating for the fiscal fourth quarter is less than 1% impact on all of our cost of goods sold. Not on -- that basically talks about all of the costs of goods sold, maybe not only the flash portion.\nMehdi Hosseini : Okay. Can I not answer a question? Is FX more like a clarification?\nDavid Goeckeler : So far, Mehdi.\nMehdi Hosseini : Just back to David, given your LTAs and you sound confident that the cloud demand is going to sustain into the second half. How should we think about nearline exabyte growth prospect in calendar year '22 versus '21?\nDavid Goeckeler : Exabyte growth in '22 versus '21, I can get you -- let me look this up real quick. If I have a pie -- look, I mean, Mehdi, if I look at it -- looking at over -- we keep coming back to 35% growth in the -- in exabytes in the cloud. That's been a pretty consistent number. I'd have to go back and put it in -- I tend to look at it more in fiscal years and calendar years, but I can follow up with you on a calendar year number.\nMehdi Hosseini : Okay. And I look forward to meeting you at the Analyst Day.\nDavid Goeckeler : I look forward to it. It's going to be fun.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNik Todorov : David, you talked about SMR quite a bit on this call. Maybe can you unpack how should we think about the impact on SMR on mix, pricing and margins, and HDD. Maybe can you touch on what kind of workloads are the cloud guys looking to deploy some more initially?\nDavid Goeckeler : Well, I'll defer the workloads until our Investor Day. We'll go into a little more detail there. But look, I think big picture, we see this last quarter, I think -- well, I know I said we had 2 big cloud titans that we're working on SMR and we expected significant shipments towards the end of the year. Within the quarter, we had another one and another one come to us about adopting SMR. So I think that -- I think that it's very clear to me that the capacity gains that can be achieved with SMR, we've been investing in this technology for a long time and this idea that you can get an extra 10% or more. And again, we'll talk about that next week -- or in a couple of weeks as well. It's very attractive, especially given the size of the drives now and how big they are, you're talking big numbers, multiple terabytes that are being added through the changes.  Now, the thing that gives me a lot of conviction on this is because it requires the -- on the host side, you have to do some software work. And nobody wants to do software work if they can avoid it or if the return is not good enough. And the fact that the big players are coming in, they're saying, look, we're going to invest in this, and we're going to pull SMR into our data centers, tells me that this is the next leg of growth in this industry. So again, we'll get to our Investor Day to talk about what it means on the portfolio, but I get back to just another way that allows us using innovation to drive a better TCO equation for our customers. And when we can drive better TCO, then we can leverage that into a conversation about value-based pricing. And that's exactly what we're doing, and that's -- it's exactly where the industry is going. And like I said, LTAs are a part of that, about getting more predictability. But the fact that we can continue to drive down the cost of storage, continue to drive a better TCO with every generation of products, to do that through innovation, that gives us opportunity to create margin and create value.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nam Kim with Arete Research.\nNam Kim : How should we think about some of your hyperscaler moving into their own enterprise SSD build? Do you expect such DIY enterprise SSD to impact your business negatively or just have a limited impact? Any color would be great.\nDavid Goeckeler : I think various of our customers have DIY projects. I think that's fine. They still -- first of all, I don't know if anybody does 100% fab, because everybody wants diversity in their supply chain. But even DIY provides us opportunity to provide, well NAND, so not just the full enterprise SSD. But like I said, even anybody that's doing DIY is also going to be buying enterprise SSDs as well for part of their footprint. And the numbers here are getting so large that whichever way you play or both. It gives us the opportunity to play in both of those franchises, quite frankly, with our big customers, providing enterprise SSDs and then providing NAND into their projects. So I think it's a reflection of how important enterprise SSDs are to the future of a very modern cloud data center. It's extraordinarily important technology, and we're very happy to be involved with the biggest customers and qualified at the biggest customers with our technology.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva : Thank you. And I look forward to seeing you all next month. But before that, it's great to see that the contamination issue is kind of behind us, of course, working through that. With that being said, the cost of all that, is that solely borne by Western Digital? Or does your supplier kind of remunerate you for that, or make up for it in future pricing or some type of insurance? And most critically, what are you doing? Have you put in something to make sure such thing doesn't happen again?\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes, I'll give some input when we so can maybe provide more details if we have them. But look, we -- the issue is fully behind us. The team has done a fantastic job of root causing it down to the very, very bones of what the issues are, and then putting in place -- obviously putting in place screens and other things to make sure it doesn't happen again. Or if it does happen again to make sure we catch it proactively. As far as the costs are split by us and our JV partner and as far as the ability to recoup any of those, I mean, I think we'll look at that. Once we get fully passed anything, we'll look and see if there's anything that will happen there. Anything to add to that, Wissam?\nWissam Jabre: I think -- no, David, I think you've covered it well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox.\nSteven Fox : I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the hard disk drive pricing. So as you mentioned, your ASPs were up 4% in the quarter. But can you talk a little bit about the like-for-like pricing currently and for the rest of the year, how you're approaching it maybe differently by the different segments. And whether it's being impacted by the sort of extended lead times you've talked about in terms of where you're maybe putting more bits than maybe you were a year ago. \nDavid Goeckeler : I think, like I said, we're working on -- I want to repeat the same thing. Again, pricing starts with value. We have to deliver value, and we're constantly innovating to deliver more value. But we're clearly working on pricing to see -- to defray some of the input costs and all the logistics costs has impacted. So that's going on across the portfolio. And then we're having conversations with our customers about the value we're providing with these next generation of drives about what that value is and how do we move to a value-based pricing model. I don't know if there's a whole lot more to say about it than that. I don't know, Wissam, anything from your perspective?\nWissam Jabre : No, not on this, David. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.\nChristian Schwab : I just have a quick question on disk drive gross margins. Given the positive impacts of mix and decreased input costs and  value pricing, if we have a China COVID shutdown end, is there any reason why the disk drive business can't be operating at  plus growth exiting calendar year?\nDavid Goeckeler : I'm sorry, you broke up when you said the number.\nChristian Schwab : Is there any reason you could -- you wouldn't be exiting the calendar year with gross margins at 30% plus again?\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes. I mean, so I think we broke those numbers out. Wissam, I think he's got the details, he had it in his remarks. But I mean, if you just took all the COVID cost of business right now, I think we'd be about 30%, right, Wissam?\nWissam Jabre : Yes. So that's very true, David. I mean the -- we did have in the quarter around 240 basis points related to the COVID costs. We've talked about slightly impacted, of course, by COVID lockdowns. We continue to see some inflationary cost pressures short term with supply chain disruptions. The -- I mean, to your question, I wouldn't necessarily want to talk about where the margins are going to be in Q4. But would it say that we do expect the margins to be better from here in the second half of the calendar year '22.\nDavid Goeckeler : Yes. It was -- I mean we're not going to commit to your number, but just as a general point, I mean, look, there's just been a lot of a lot of additional costs on the business. We've talked about it for many quarters now, logistics costs and now increased input costs that have really hit us this past quarter. And you would think as the world comes out of the pandemic, I think which is the major crux to your point, as this starts to unwind and logistics gets back to a steady state, and some of the input costs get more reasonable, we stop paying expedite fees for certain components and things like that because there's just a more smooth flowing supplier ecosystem. It will unburden a lot of costs on the business. And again, I think this is masking somewhat, although not completely, a major fundamental structural change that's going on in the business, which I've talked about a lot, which is the HDD market is a growth market, and it's a growth market where we're going to need to invest capital to build additional heads and media capacity. And when that happens, I think the economic equation changes, and we get -- the key thing in that kind of world is can you still innovate and can you still bring new things to the product that makes it more valuable to your customer? And I think that is what we've really been focused on, from ePMR to OptiNAND to SMR, we're just really focused on innovation, bring a better value proposition that will be able to build a better product for our customers, and we'll get into that value-based pricing thing. So if we get both of those going and we can get the cost out because of the pandemic, I think we'll -- we feel very good about the business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark Company.\nMark Miller : I'm just wondering in terms of mix, NAND mix, how is that progressing in terms of mobile versus the other segment you ship into? Are you seeing increasingly more shipments in the mobile? And where do you expect that's going?\nDavid Goeckeler : There's a couple of dynamics to this. I think over the -- looking -- the past couple of quarters, we had a higher shift -- higher mix towards mobile as we were ramping BiCS5. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, we've gotten past our qualifications of BiCS5 in the consumer market, and in our client SSD market. So we see an acceleration of mix into those on BiCS5. And then there's a lot of hard work going on to qualify our enterprise SSDs on BiCS5. And as that happens throughout this year, then you'll see an acceleration of that market as well into BiCS5. The reality is we have demand on enterprise SSD. We can't meet because it's on BiCS4 right now. So as we get that into BiCS5, you'll see the mix change, and you'll see the enterprise SSD mix accelerate through the second half of the year, which will provide a tailwind to business. This -- we'll talk about this a little bit more at Investor Day as well to put one more plug in to see all of you on the 10th.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities.\nKevin Cassidy : Yes, looking forward to May 10 and May 9. I just wondered if you could give us a little more details on the Fab7 ramp. What what's -- you've mentioned brownfield as production. And can I just understand a little better what that means? Is it -- you start off with only 20,000 wafers a month or, any numbers like that you can give us? \nDavid Goeckeler : So first of all, let me clarify the brownfield. I think what the point Wissam was making there was that K2 expenses will not be at the level of K1 because K1 was a greenfield and K2 is a brownfield. So -- the same situation with Y7, which ramping in Yokkaichi, obviously a brownfield launch there as well. Wissam may have some information about how the expenses roll out. As far as how the wafer scale, we'll start ramping that, I think, on our newer nodes, but we'll have more to say about that when we start getting the tools in there and all of that. I don't know, Wissam, anything to add?\nWissam Jabre : Yes. The -- just maybe to clarify thanks, to clarify the -- my comment on brownfield versus greenfield was exactly just to really highlight that the costs aren't as high as we've seen in K1. They weren't really -- they're not very significant. But of course, it's a bit of a headwind to the gross margin.\nOperator: Thank you. Speakers, I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Goeckeler for any closing remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. As we've said a couple of times, we look forward to seeing -- hopefully, we'll see you on May 9 as was pointed out for some new product launches. We'll have some exciting new technology coming out then. And then on the 10th -- May 10, May 9 and 10, on the 10th, we'll have our Investor Day, which we've been looking forward to for quite some time. So we will see you there. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. We delivered excellent performance in the quarter, with revenue of $4.4 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 31.7%, both of which are at the higher end of our updated guidance ranges we provided in early March. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which exceeded our revised guidance. I am proud of the team's execution as we navigated dynamic geopolitical and macroeconomic environment as well as ongoing supply challenges. On top of that, we successfully managed through a fab contamination event that is now fully resolved. Overall, the Western Digital team did an amazing job of meeting our customers' growing and evolving storage needs. This has all been made possible by the operational and technological improvements we have made over the last couple of years that enable us to unlock the true earnings power of the Western Digital model. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the business outlook for calendar year 2022. We believe the secular demand for storage in our new product ramps in HDD and Flash, combined with the seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year, will drive growth across our end markets. With 40% of the world's data stored on Western Digital products, our innovation powers the global technology ecosystem from consumer devices to the edge to the heart of the cloud. Our vision is to create breakthrough innovation inspired by the convergence of human potential and digital transformation that enables the world to actualize its aspirations. At Western Digital, we have established an admirable position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to develop a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a unique position to capitalize on the promising growth opportunities ahead of us. I'll now turn to an update on our HDD and Flash businesses. Our HDD revenue was as forecast and in line with typical March quarter seasonality led by growth in capacity enterprise drives. Robust demand in the cloud end market for 18- and 20-terabyte drives generated a nearly 40% increase in nearline revenue from the same period last year. Of note, our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments approached high single-digit percentage of total capacity enterprise shipments. During the quarter, qualification of OptiNAND-based hard drives progressed as planned across multiple cloud and OEM customers. Combining OptiNAND with our SMR leadership uniquely positions Western Digital in the marketplace. Putting it all together, we have positioned our innovations in OptiNAND and SMR to drive business results in our capacity enterprise business for the rest of this calendar year and into the future. Our largest cloud customers are aligned with this strategy and are accelerating adoption of SMR products within data centers later this year. We are laser-focused on bringing new cutting-edge features and functions to our products for cloud storage. We will provide more details around these exciting innovations at our Investor Day on May 10. Turning to Flash. Our overall business was impacted by our ability to ship product due to the fab excursion. In light of this event, coupled with the supply chain challenges facing all companies across the industry, I would like to thank our customers and the Western Digital teams for working together diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. From a product perspective, client SSD demand improved in the quarter as our PC OEM customers successfully worked through their own supply chain issues. Gaming is another growth market for us, where we continue to have success with exabyte shipment nearly doubling year-over-year. We have a leading position in the marketplace with our brands, including WD_BLACK, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional, recognized globally for cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. An example of this is our WD_BLACK SN770 SSD product, which leverages our cutting-edge BiCS5 technology, an in-house DRAM-less controller architecture. This SSD product is one of the fastest and best drives available in the market. We have received excellent reviews from tech journalists, which is a great testament to the company's strength in both our BiCS technology leadership and our ability to develop innovative solutions, enabling our customers to unlock the potential of their PCs. Qualifications of BiCS5-based products for client and consumer end markets were largely completed, and we are making great progress in qualifying our next-generation BiCS5 enterprise SSD products. We expect these products to drive revenue growth and mix improvements into the future. Lastly, BiCS5 represented nearly half of the Flash revenue, up from 41% in the previous quarter. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In cloud, we see continued strength in calendar year 2022. The increase in cloud capital investment for data center build-outs is expected to propel growth for our HDD and Flash products in this growing end market. In client, PC end demand growth has been solid for the last 2 years, and we are starting to see some normalization in the PC market. We expect PC unit demand to remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, with the return-to-site trend driving a mix shift towards commercial and enterprise PCs with richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs. In mobile, we have a strong position in 5G phones and we see demand for the latest 5G flagship phones remaining solid, with NAND content doubling from prior generation smartphones. In other emerging applications, demand from gaming and VR/AR devices remains robust. Industry analysts expect VR headset sales to grow at a 47% CAGR over the next couple of years. In consumer, we are experiencing short-term demand weakness outside the U.S. tied to the geopolitical events in Europe, as well as COVID-related lockdowns in China. However, we are confident in the strength of the business as we are entering a seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year with a number of new innovative products. We feel good about the overall demand in calendar year 2022. We are continuing to navigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors I mentioned earlier. While these transitory issues are affecting both revenue and gross margin in the near term, we expect them to subside over time. We are confident that the growth and profitability opportunities in front of us have not changed. In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and unrelenting spirit of our employees that goes into creating our game-changing products. In particular, I want to thank our employees in China for their efforts to work through all the supply chain and logistics challenges during the lockdowns. Before turning the call over to Wissam, I wanted to make a quick announcement that Western Digital and the IRS have reached a tentative agreement to resolve a long-running tax matter, covering the fiscal years 2008 through 2015. With offsetting tax benefits, we expect the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million. While this settlement will result in a previously unforecasted cash payment in fiscal year 2023, it does highlight the work that I and the rest of the Western Digital team have undertaken in the last 2 years to instill strong financial discipline and provide greater financial flexibility upon which we are building a foundation for future growth for the company. Wissam will go into more detail in a minute. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal third quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Wissam? Thanks, Wissam. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook for the calendar year as customer demand across our end markets continues to be generally strong. Despite the supply chain challenges and macroeconomic factors we discussed earlier, it is evident that we have the right foundation for long-term growth, the right technology portfolio in place to meet evolving customer needs and the broad routes to market necessary to scale our business. Over the last couple of years, we have planned and executed significant changes to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I'm excited that we are witnessing the positive impacts of those changes. Before I wrap up, I want to remind everyone, we have an Investor Day coming up on May 10, and I look forward to seeing you all there. Let's start the Q&A. Hey, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, on the flash side, so first of all, as we said, the flash contamination issue is behind us in the fab. We expect bit growth next quarter. We won't be all the way back, but we'll -- we expect to accelerate from where we were this quarter.  As far as the situation in Penang and China, we did have that facility shut down for a couple of weeks. At the end of last quarter, we've mostly recovered that as far as the -- as being able to meet demand for this quarter. I would say that as a general statement, it's -- I think it's very difficult for everybody to meet what true demand is right now in the market. So between component shortages and the situation in China, it makes it really tough. But I think we were able to navigate through the situation quite well, quite -- frankly, the team there did a fantastic job and has kind of recovered. There were some incremental costs as we saw in the HDD margin line that we didn't expect. But all in all, I think we navigated through the situation fairly well. For the coming quarter, yes, we're still dealing with the situations in China, but we think we'll be able to navigate through, although it is very, very dynamic. But we factored in all the risks into the guide, and we're comfortable with where the number's at. Wissam, anything to add? So I'll take -- I'll start on it, and Wissam can add. So on the drive business, last quarter, we talked about the 200 basis point to 300 basis point impact that we were expecting. I think we took a little that in this quarter than we had expected. Some of that was some cost we didn't expect, like I just talked about in Shenzhen. I think I said Penang earlier, but Shenzhen. And -- so in that business, looking forward, I think we see it as pretty much -- we've pretty much hit the bottom. We basically see it flat going forward. In the flash business, we expect some acceleration of gross margin given the supply-demand balance situation. So Wissam, anything to add to that? Joe, yes, that's still the right number. I mean the team will always work in kind of an evolving situation to see what they can do with the material that we had to take out. But I don't think it will be super material to the numbers. So 7 is a good place to work from. And we haven't split it up over the quarters, but the majority of it we took in the previous quarter. Yes. I'm not going to speak for them. But we have joint manufacturing facilities, for sure. I'll put a much larger frame on it, Tom. I think what's happening, and we see it show up in a number of ways, and there's a lot of COVID implications and costs in it, too. But I just -- I think we're just seeing the industry change from a world where there was always capacity enterprise drives available. Hard drives were available. It was about putting as many as you could in places where you could fill up factories and get good absorption and not have to pay incremental cost for that. That's kind of decline of the client era and the rise of the cloud era. We're pretty much through that, we're in the last legs of it. And I just think you're seeing a lot of industry dynamics change. You're seeing long-term agreements come in much something that last year was kind of a new concept that we were working through. Now it's becoming much more mainstream with our big customers just to give us visibility to making investments in this business. Essentially, we don't have a lot of capacity anymore to shift from client to enterprise and the cloud, and we're having to invest in that, and that's causing the whole industry to shift the way it thinks about this technology and my point of view. I think it starts with we're still driving a strong TCO model for our customers. That's where it all starts. Every generation of technology, we're able to bring down the TCO for our customers. In the past, I think as we did that, the reward for our side of it was more volume, to soak up that capacity. Well, that's not the case anymore. Now we have to invest in new volume, so the industry has to change. So we're bringing a lot of TCO value. And I think you're seeing the industry move to providing more visibility, thinking about value-based pricing more -- and how do we move that value equation in a way that we can continue to drive the TCO down and drive a better pricing environment. So that's the big picture. And then, of course, there's a lot of costs in the system right now and inflation input costs are going up, and we're working through pricing if we can mitigate parts of that. That's happening as well. Yes. We do expect -- as we talked about last quarter, we're pretty much in the same place, which is we expected the decline we saw this quarter -- we actually expected gross margin to be a little lower next quarter. Now we think that will be flat. And then we expect that to improve in the second half for a number of reasons: Mix, input costs that are changing a bit and also some pricing benefit. So yes, we expect next quarter to be the low and then we expect to improve from there. Yes. So let me unpack that a little bit and thanks, Patrick. So -- the -- it's largely the same customers that will move from 18 to 20. I mean I think, as I said earlier, the TCO equation improves as you go -- as you keep driving forward. So it's a very part of what we do. I mean this is -- I talk about innovation a lot around here, and the innovation we've driven around ePMR and now OptiNAND and SMR, those are all things that we layer into our products and allow our customers every time they move a generation forward, they get better TCO equation. So there's reasons to keep moving forward. So that's kind of the way that works a little bit. By the way, we'll come back and talk about SMR a little bit more. We're continuing to see more momentum towards SMR. That is the future of the cloud HDD business, is SMR. All the big players are now moving down that path, which is a technology we've been investing in for quite some time. On your other question on -- look, the LTAs don't drive the spending and the LTAs help smooth out the spending. I think the whole idea with the LTA is to give -- we have a strong relationship with our big customers and to give better visibility 2, 3 quarters out. I've talked about this a lot in the past, the business used to -- if I think back a year ago or 2 years ago when I came into the business, the business was just transacted quarter-to-quarter and even within the quarter. And clearly, given the investments we need to make to continue to drive investments in heads and media to fund -- to fuel the exabyte growth, we're going to need more visibility than that. And so the LTAs have been adopted. And we strike those with our big customers on multi-quarter timeframes, and then we stick to them. And that's been very good as far as smoothing out any ups and downs in builds on their side. And so, as far as the second half environment, our big cloud customers continue to tell us and signal a strong demand environment in the second half of the year. So we'll be excited about driving to them with -- starting with 18 and then transitioning to 20 as we move through the year. Yes. I would imagine the 20 crossover will be in the second half of the year. I mean we're deep into the 18s right now. I mean, 18 is probably 80% of the portfolio of shipping. So it's the sweet spot of the market. As we move through the year, we'll start to ramp 20. So towards the end of the year, early next year -- we can circle back on a specific date, but that's the way we're thinking about it. The surveillance market, smart video market, that's been soft all year. So we continue to see that with the lockdowns in China. We expect that once that ends, there'll be some snapback and some recovery of pushed out demand there. But right now, given the COVID situation, I think that, that market is not going to change until the COVID situation changes. Is it -- margin. I don't think we break out of that level. I don't know, Wissam, do you have a comment on that, or Peter? I will let Wissam handle the gross margin question. The bit growth -- look, our bit growth will be down this year. We're not going to put a fund number out there right now. But given the fab excursion, we'll be down this year. And then we'll make it up over the next year or so, a year plus. It will take a while to fully come back to our fair share of bits. Our strategy has been very consistent for a long time. We invest to maintain share. And you see us doing that, including recent fab announcements with Kioxia. Wissam, do you want to talk about gross margin a little bit in flash? So far, Mehdi. Exabyte growth in '22 versus '21, I can get you -- let me look this up real quick. If I have a pie -- look, I mean, Mehdi, if I look at it -- looking at over -- we keep coming back to 35% growth in the -- in exabytes in the cloud. That's been a pretty consistent number. I'd have to go back and put it in -- I tend to look at it more in fiscal years and calendar years, but I can follow up with you on a calendar year number. I look forward to it. It's going to be fun. Well, I'll defer the workloads until our Investor Day. We'll go into a little more detail there. But look, I think big picture, we see this last quarter, I think -- well, I know I said we had 2 big cloud titans that we're working on SMR and we expected significant shipments towards the end of the year. Within the quarter, we had another one and another one come to us about adopting SMR. So I think that -- I think that it's very clear to me that the capacity gains that can be achieved with SMR, we've been investing in this technology for a long time and this idea that you can get an extra 10% or more. And again, we'll talk about that next week -- or in a couple of weeks as well. It's very attractive, especially given the size of the drives now and how big they are, you're talking big numbers, multiple terabytes that are being added through the changes.  Now, the thing that gives me a lot of conviction on this is because it requires the -- on the host side, you have to do some software work. And nobody wants to do software work if they can avoid it or if the return is not good enough. And the fact that the big players are coming in, they're saying, look, we're going to invest in this, and we're going to pull SMR into our data centers, tells me that this is the next leg of growth in this industry. So again, we'll get to our Investor Day to talk about what it means on the portfolio, but I get back to just another way that allows us using innovation to drive a better TCO equation for our customers. And when we can drive better TCO, then we can leverage that into a conversation about value-based pricing. And that's exactly what we're doing, and that's -- it's exactly where the industry is going. And like I said, LTAs are a part of that, about getting more predictability. But the fact that we can continue to drive down the cost of storage, continue to drive a better TCO with every generation of products, to do that through innovation, that gives us opportunity to create margin and create value. I think various of our customers have DIY projects. I think that's fine. They still -- first of all, I don't know if anybody does 100% fab, because everybody wants diversity in their supply chain. But even DIY provides us opportunity to provide, well NAND, so not just the full enterprise SSD. But like I said, even anybody that's doing DIY is also going to be buying enterprise SSDs as well for part of their footprint. And the numbers here are getting so large that whichever way you play or both. It gives us the opportunity to play in both of those franchises, quite frankly, with our big customers, providing enterprise SSDs and then providing NAND into their projects. So I think it's a reflection of how important enterprise SSDs are to the future of a very modern cloud data center. It's extraordinarily important technology, and we're very happy to be involved with the biggest customers and qualified at the biggest customers with our technology. Yes, I'll give some input when we so can maybe provide more details if we have them. But look, we -- the issue is fully behind us. The team has done a fantastic job of root causing it down to the very, very bones of what the issues are, and then putting in place -- obviously putting in place screens and other things to make sure it doesn't happen again. Or if it does happen again to make sure we catch it proactively. As far as the costs are split by us and our JV partner and as far as the ability to recoup any of those, I mean, I think we'll look at that. Once we get fully passed anything, we'll look and see if there's anything that will happen there. Anything to add to that, Wissam? I think, like I said, we're working on -- I want to repeat the same thing. Again, pricing starts with value. We have to deliver value, and we're constantly innovating to deliver more value. But we're clearly working on pricing to see -- to defray some of the input costs and all the logistics costs has impacted. So that's going on across the portfolio. And then we're having conversations with our customers about the value we're providing with these next generation of drives about what that value is and how do we move to a value-based pricing model. I don't know if there's a whole lot more to say about it than that. I don't know, Wissam, anything from your perspective? I'm sorry, you broke up when you said the number. Yes. I mean, so I think we broke those numbers out. Wissam, I think he's got the details, he had it in his remarks. But I mean, if you just took all the COVID cost of business right now, I think we'd be about 30%, right, Wissam? Yes. It was -- I mean we're not going to commit to your number, but just as a general point, I mean, look, there's just been a lot of a lot of additional costs on the business. We've talked about it for many quarters now, logistics costs and now increased input costs that have really hit us this past quarter. And you would think as the world comes out of the pandemic, I think which is the major crux to your point, as this starts to unwind and logistics gets back to a steady state, and some of the input costs get more reasonable, we stop paying expedite fees for certain components and things like that because there's just a more smooth flowing supplier ecosystem. It will unburden a lot of costs on the business. And again, I think this is masking somewhat, although not completely, a major fundamental structural change that's going on in the business, which I've talked about a lot, which is the HDD market is a growth market, and it's a growth market where we're going to need to invest capital to build additional heads and media capacity. And when that happens, I think the economic equation changes, and we get -- the key thing in that kind of world is can you still innovate and can you still bring new things to the product that makes it more valuable to your customer? And I think that is what we've really been focused on, from ePMR to OptiNAND to SMR, we're just really focused on innovation, bring a better value proposition that will be able to build a better product for our customers, and we'll get into that value-based pricing thing. So if we get both of those going and we can get the cost out because of the pandemic, I think we'll -- we feel very good about the business. There's a couple of dynamics to this. I think over the -- looking -- the past couple of quarters, we had a higher shift -- higher mix towards mobile as we were ramping BiCS5. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, we've gotten past our qualifications of BiCS5 in the consumer market, and in our client SSD market. So we see an acceleration of mix into those on BiCS5. And then there's a lot of hard work going on to qualify our enterprise SSDs on BiCS5. And as that happens throughout this year, then you'll see an acceleration of that market as well into BiCS5. The reality is we have demand on enterprise SSD. We can't meet because it's on BiCS4 right now. So as we get that into BiCS5, you'll see the mix change, and you'll see the enterprise SSD mix accelerate through the second half of the year, which will provide a tailwind to business. This -- we'll talk about this a little bit more at Investor Day as well to put one more plug in to see all of you on the 10th. So first of all, let me clarify the brownfield. I think what the point Wissam was making there was that K2 expenses will not be at the level of K1 because K1 was a greenfield and K2 is a brownfield. So -- the same situation with Y7, which ramping in Yokkaichi, obviously a brownfield launch there as well. Wissam may have some information about how the expenses roll out. As far as how the wafer scale, we'll start ramping that, I think, on our newer nodes, but we'll have more to say about that when we start getting the tools in there and all of that. I don't know, Wissam, anything to add? All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. As we've said a couple of times, we look forward to seeing -- hopefully, we'll see you on May 9 as was pointed out for some new product launches. We'll have some exciting new technology coming out then. And then on the 10th -- May 10, May 9 and 10, on the 10th, we'll have our Investor Day, which we've been looking forward to for quite some time. So we will see you there. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Wissam Jabre",
            "content": "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal third quarter were better than our revised expectations. Despite the incredibly dynamic macro environment that David discussed, our results reflected the resilience of our business and our ability to continually deliver solid financial performance. In addition, we completed a debt restructuring with our lenders in the March quarter, marking continued success in paying down debt and providing increased financial flexibility and stability. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, down 9% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.65, above the revised guidance range of $1.30 to $1.60 we provided in early March. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of the challenging environment. Turning to our end markets. Cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.8 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 25% from a year ago. Within cloud, Western Digital's leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point and ramp of 20-terabyte drives drove a nearly 40% year-over-year increase in nearline revenue. This growth was partially offset by lower enterprise SSD and smart video hard drive revenues. The client end market represented 40% of total revenue at $1.7 billion, down 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily due to typical seasonality in both Flash for mobile and client hard drives. On a year-over-year basis, growth in Flash was offset by a decline in hard drive. Lastly, Consumer represented 20% of revenue at $0.9 billion, down 17% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline was primarily due to lower retail Flash shipments. The year-over-year decrease was roughly evenly split between hard drive and Flash products. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported Flash revenue of $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. On a blended basis, Flash ASPs were down 1% sequentially. On a like-for-like basis, Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and increased 9% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recognized the majority of the bit supply impact caused by the fab contamination. Hard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $101. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments and average price per hard drive increased by 20% and 22%, respectively. As we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. In the March quarter, total fab contamination charges of $203 million were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Gross margin for the third quarter was 31.7%, down 190 basis points sequentially and up 400 basis points year-over-year, including approximately $59 million in COVID-related expenses. Our Flash gross margin was 35.6%, down 50 basis points sequentially and up 560 basis points year-over-year. Our hard drive gross margin was 27.7%, down 290 basis points sequentially and up 270 basis points year-over-year. Hard drive gross margin included COVID-related impact of approximately $51 million or 240 basis points. Operating expenses of $740 million were below our guidance range as we tightly managed our expenses. Operating income was $650 million, representing a 26% decrease from the prior quarter and a 58% increase year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.65, up from $1.02 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $398 million, and free cash flow was $148 million. Cash and capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, represented a cash outflow of $250 million. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity and expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $2.9 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be around $1.3 billion as we actively manage our overall spending. In the fiscal third quarter, we made a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.25 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.51 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.4x compared to 2.6x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Before discussing our outlook, I wanted to provide some more details on the settlement with the IRS that David mentioned. As previously disclosed in our quarterly SEC filings, the company has been in a significant long-running situation with the IRS regarding taxes owed for fiscal years 2008 through 2015. As you can see in our GAAP statements, we took a tax charge in the fiscal third quarter, primarily based on our latest assessment of the situation. In the last few days, we reached a tentative agreement to settle the transfer pricing issues in dispute. The actual amount to Western Digital will have to pay and exact timing of the payments have not been determined yet. However, we currently expect to make a cash payment in the range of $600 million to $700 million some time in the first half of fiscal 2023. Please note that this is the cash out number. We currently expect that the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million after accounting for certain offsetting tax benefits expected to be recouped over the next 3 years. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we will make a GAAP-only adjustment to the reserve associated with this settlement. You will find additional details in our 10-Q, which we plan to file next week. I'll now provide our view of both hard drive and flash businesses for the fiscal fourth quarter. As we indicated on our last earnings call, we continue to expect hard drive revenue to increase driven by growth in nearline hard drives. We also expect Flash revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth fiscal quarter as our flash supply improves.  For our fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion with sequential revenue growth for both hard drive and flash businesses; we expect gross margin to be between 31% and 33%; we expect operating expenses to be between $770 million and $790 million; interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million; our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the fourth quarter; we expect earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.90 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Not much, David. I think you've covered it well. Yes David, just maybe to follow-on on the comments or Aaron's question with respect to COVID, where we see the COVID costs going into next quarter are expected to be a little bit less than what we've experienced in the fiscal third quarter. Yes, of course. Yes, Tom. So we do expect that our long term -- to continue to reach our long-term target of cost reduction, which is 15% year-on-year. The -- we did see a bit of a headwind in the current quarter, but it's really impacted by a few factors that we expect will anticipate in the next couple of quarters. So we saw, for instance, we continue to ramp our BiCS5 technology, as well as just like everybody, we're seeing some inflationary pressure as well as the start-up of our Yokkaichi Fab7. But we still expect for this fiscal year '22 to be at least 15% year-on-year in terms of cost reduction. And as I started with, we do expect to continue to meet that target going forward. Yes. Actually, David, we don't break out down to that level of detail. Of course, David. So Sidney, thanks for the question. The -- when we think of the flash business, I think to address maybe the part of the question around the Yokkaichi start-up cost, they're not very significant and actually, they're much lower than the K1 fab start-up, we're talking about really a brownfield expansion here versus a greenfield expansion. To the part of your question with respect to our flash gross margin that's sort of embedded in the guidance. Of course, mix always plays a part in any gross margin, whether it's actual or projected. So -- but as I said earlier, we're still expecting to meet that 15%-plus year-on-year cost reduction for flash in the fiscal year 2022. I hope this helps. So maybe I'll -- thanks, Mehdi, for the question. Then maybe I'll just talk about the FX in general. So our approach is we do -- we use a layered hedging approach, which means it's -- there's much more coverage in hedge on the shorter term versus the longer term. And so that smoothens out the impact of FX over time.  And the way also to think of it as any incurred cost within the quarter typically will not really impact the P&L until approximately 90 to 120 days later, given the manufacturing cycle times and lead time for delivery of product. And so the -- whatever we're seeing at least in the past short term in terms of currency fluctuations, will not be that impactful to the numbers. What we saw in -- what we're sort of expecting -- actually, what we saw in this quarter and what we're anticipating for the fiscal fourth quarter is less than 1% impact on all of our cost of goods sold. Not on -- that basically talks about all of the costs of goods sold, maybe not only the flash portion. I think -- no, David, I think you've covered it well. No, not on this, David. Yes. So that's very true, David. I mean the -- we did have in the quarter around 240 basis points related to the COVID costs. We've talked about slightly impacted, of course, by COVID lockdowns. We continue to see some inflationary cost pressures short term with supply chain disruptions. The -- I mean, to your question, I wouldn't necessarily want to talk about where the margins are going to be in Q4. But would it say that we do expect the margins to be better from here in the second half of the calendar year '22. Yes. The -- just maybe to clarify thanks, to clarify the -- my comment on brownfield versus greenfield was exactly just to really highlight that the costs aren't as high as we've seen in K1. They weren't really -- they're not very significant. But of course, it's a bit of a headwind to the gross margin."

Now, we will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, trends and financial outlook based on management\u2019s current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2022 results. We delivered strong results for the fiscal second quarter, with revenue of $4.8 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 33.6%, both of which are within the guidance range we provided last quarter. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, which was ahead of our expectations. I am proud of the team as this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding guidance amid a continuously increasingly challenged supply chain. Before I go over the detailed results and business trends, I want to offer some important key takeaways coming out of calendar year 2021. First, we have made significant progress in strengthening our product portfolio. We delivered on our goals of qualifying our enterprise SSD products at 3 cloud titans and 2 OEMs, commercializing energy-assisted hard drives as well as commencing shipments of 20-terabyte hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. These products address the large and fast growing opportunities within the cloud for storage. Second, demand for Western Digital storage solutions across cloud, client and consumer end markets remains consistently strong. We are optimistic about our outlook for calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate solid demand across the end markets we serve. I will share more about that demand and other macro factors later. Third, we are continuing to navigate an increasingly complex supply chain, which is impacting both our customers\u2019 ability to ship products as well as our ability to build products. In order to meet our end customers\u2019 demand, we are incurring additional costs that will weigh primarily on our hard drive gross margins through the first half of calendar year 2022. These issues are transitory in nature, affecting both revenue and gross margin and we expect them to subside as the supply chain normalizes. We remain confident that the long-term growth and profitability opportunity in front of us has not changed. Lastly, we received an investment grade corporate rating from Fitch in December, which represents Western Digital\u2019s second investment grade corporate rating. This marks an important milestone as we have worked hard over the last 18 months to strengthen our financial position, providing us with greater financial flexibility in the future. As we approach our targeted debt levels, we look forward to reengaging in a capital return program in fiscal year 2023. Turning to our results, this past quarter, demand remained strong across our end markets and our customers and the Western Digital teams continue to work diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. In particular, cloud revenue for the fiscal second quarter increased by 89% from the same period last year. We continue to anticipate strength in storage demand, which is bolstered by our ability to continue to bring innovative new products to market to meet the needs of the digital economy. The potential of what can be accomplished through the creation of content and the ability to access digital information easily has never been greater. With our technology, we are enabling businesses, creators and innovators to think bigger and push their limits even further. Western Digital has built a great position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to innovate and develop a balanced portfolio, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a strong position to capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead of us. I will now recap our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, overall cloud end-market product demand remained high, with revenue increasing 50% year-over-year led by capacity enterprise hard drives. Although we were up strongly year-over-year, capacity enterprise hard drives declined sequentially after two quarters of strong shipments, partly due to some of our customers\u2019 supply chain challenges. As both Western Digital earned customers continue to face supply chain challenges, we will experience some near-term visibility issues. However, our overall demand signals continue to be very good as we move through the calendar year and we will be in a stronger position once these headwinds subside. During the fiscal second quarter, we commenced volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. We are very excited about OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the control plane to further increase areal density. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in customer interest in adopting SMR technology and expect multiple cloud titans to deploy SMR drives in high volume later in this calendar year. In Flash, revenue grew in the second fiscal quarter due to seasonal strength in mobile and consumer. Within mobile, shipments of our BiCS5 products into leading 5G smartphones increased over 60% sequentially and 50% year-over-year, led by strong content growth. BiCS5 shipments represented over 40% of total revenue and BiCS5 production crossover took place during the quarter as expected. The successful ramp of BiCS5 helped accelerate our overall year-over-year bit shipment growth to 37% in the quarter. Our WD_BLACK premium SSD product line optimized for the best gaming experience continues to gain momentum, with revenue increasing about 50% sequentially and doubling in calendar year 2021. Along with flash products for gaming consoles, revenue has grown from 0 to over 10% of our flash portfolio over the last 2 years. As consumers demand more ways to access, generate and store content, whether via gaming or the now emerging Metaverse, our strong and growing flash portfolio will be integral to enable all of these applications. In line with the guidance we provided last quarter, our client SSD business declined sequentially due to supply chain disruptions at some of our PC customers and pricing pressure in the more transactional markets. So far, within the current quarter, we are starting to see pricing in the more transactional markets stabilize. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise SSD products are qualified at 3 cloud titans and 2 major storage OEMs, marking significant progress compared to 1 cloud titan a year ago. As you know, this has been one of my top priorities. Building upon the early success of ramping BiCS5 into mobile and gaming consoles, we are further strengthening our product portfolio as we move through calendar year 2022. In client SSD, the bedrock of Western Digital\u2019s flash portfolio, we have launched and are ramping BiCS5-based products in the fiscal third quarter, with BiCS5 enterprise SSD products later in the year. For our next-generation 3D flash, we began initial commercial shipment of consumer flash devices based on our 162-layer BiCS6. Furthermore, we qualified and commenced revenue shipment of client SSDs based on QLC and BiCS5 technology in the fiscal second quarter. While still early in its evolution, we are starting to pave the way for the industry\u2019s adoption of QLC in the future and our next-generation BiCS6 node will play an important role in that evolution. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. The accelerated digital transformation in the last 2 years has created a world that is more technology-enabled and technology-dependent than ever before. We anticipate these trends will continue to drive data storage growth across each end market we serve: cloud, client and consumer. Our customers remain optimistic about demand trends in calendar 2022, driven by capital investment for the cloud build-out, continued recovery in enterprise spending, growth in smart video applications, increased adoption in 5G phones, consumer gaming and emerging trends such as VR/AR devices. In cloud, our customers have announced a 36% year-over-year increase in capital investment for the cloud build-out. This coupled with an increase in enterprise spending and continued growth in smart video applications, is expected to drive growth for our flash and HDD products into this growing end market. In client, PC end demand has remained strong. Our customers are driving more consistent demand than the past several quarters and we see continued stabilization in 2022. PC unit shipment forecasts continue to be robust and significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we anticipate an eventual return to site to drive a mix shift towards commercial PCs, which tend to offer richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs. In mobile, the latest 5G phones have doubled NAND content from prior generation smartphones. We expect mobile device content to benefit as ongoing 5G adoption and new 5G-enabled applications are expected to drive the storage demand in both endpoints in the cloud. In consumer, the highlight of this end market is our WD_BLACK SSD line of products optimized for gaming enthusiasts. Revenue more than doubled in calendar year 2021. The consumer recognition of the strength and value of WD_BLACK, along with the SanDisk and SanDisk Professional brands, drove a 34% year-over-year growth in average capacity per unit in consumer flash. While end customer demand in calendar 2022 looks promising, supply chain challenges are increasing. This both limits our ability to source components to meet customer demand and increases component costs. These costs are on top of the ongoing elevated logistics and health and safety COVID costs. While we believe these incremental costs are transitory and will subside as the supply chain conditions normalize, they will impact our results through the first half of this calendar year. Let me now turn the call over to Bob who will discuss our fiscal second quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for calendar year 2022. Bob?\nBob Eulau: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were better than our expectations, marking the seventh consecutive quarter that we have met or exceeded guidance. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 4% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Please note that this figure includes $70 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I will provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of ongoing supply chain issues and COVID-related challenges. In addition to this solid financial performance, we hit a major milestone this quarter in receiving an investment grade corporate rating from Fitch. This marks the company\u2019s second investment grade corporate rating. We are pleased to see that our work to build a stronger financial foundation is being recognized and is providing us with greater financial flexibility for the future. Additionally, we closed a public debt offering last December and amended our loan agreement with lenders in January, bringing the maturity of over 85% of our debt balance to 2026 and beyond. For more details, please refer to our earnings presentation. Turning to our end markets, cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.9 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 89% from a year ago. Supply chain disruptions impacted cloud hard drive deployments at certain customers, which led to a sequential decline in exabyte shipments in the fiscal second quarter. However, healthy overall demand for capacity enterprise drives, along with Western Digital\u2019s leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point, drove a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in exabyte shipments. The client end market represented 38% of total revenue at $1.9 billion flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. The continued ramp of 5G phones helped offset decline in both client SSD and client hard drive revenue, enabling total client revenue to stay flat. Client hard drives represent less than 15% of our HDD revenue. Lastly, consumer represented 22% of revenue at $1.1 billion, up 9% sequentially and flat year-over-year. With a strong holiday season, retail flash led the sequential growth in consumer. On a year-over-year basis, growth in consumer flash was offset by a decline in consumer HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment, we reported flash revenue of $2.6 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 6% sequentially due to a seasonal increase in shipments to mobile and retail. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially. Flash bit shipments increased by 13% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments decreased by 14%, while the average price per hard drive decreased by 5% to $97. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 27%. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 33.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. As noted earlier, the COVID-related impact was $10 million higher than we anticipated at $70 million. Our flash gross margin was 36.1%, down 0.9 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $10 million or approximately 0.4 percentage points. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $60 million or approximately 2.7 percentage points. Operating expenses of $741 million were below our guidance range due to prudent cost control and lower variable compensation expense. Operating income was $882 million, representing a 7% decrease from the prior quarter and 157% increase year-over-year, highlighting our ability to drive profitable growth. Earnings per share, was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $666 million, and free cash flow was $407 million. Despite a slight increase in inventory due to supply chain disruption, we maintained strong cash flow generation in the quarter. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, with a cash outflow of $259 million. We remain prudent in investing in manufacturing capacity and continue to expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $3 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be around $1.5 billion as we actively manage our overall spending. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we fully repaid our Term Loan B in the amount of $943 million last October. In addition, last December, we closed a public offering of $1 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $1.3 billion on our Term Loan A, bringing our gross debt outstanding to $7.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. On top of that, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to revise the terms of our loan agreement to reflect our improved credit ratings and to extend the maturity of our term loan and revolving credit facility from 2023 to 2027. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5x. This compares to 3.0x in the third fiscal quarter of 2020, when we announced the plan to focus on debt repayment to achieve greater financial flexibility. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Considering the transitory supply chain challenges we discussed earlier, I would like to provide a bit more color on our view of both hard drive and Flash businesses in calendar 2022. Within our hard drive segment, we expect hard drive revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the third fiscal quarter. While the supply chain disruptions at some of our customers are expected to remain, the larger issue of late has been our ability to source components to meet customer demand. We expect revenue to return to sequential growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While overall hard drive pricing is expected to remain relatively stable, we expect gross margins to decline 2 to 3 percentage points from the fiscal second quarter through the fiscal fourth quarter due primarily to component cost inflation. Within our Flash segment, we expect Flash revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the fiscal third quarter driven by ASP. We expect Flash revenue to return to growth in the second half of calendar year 2022. Furthermore, we anticipate downward pressure on gross margins for the first half of this calendar year as cost reductions revert towards our long-term target of 15%. In regard to our fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.65 billion with a sequential revenue decline for both Flash and hard drive businesses. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect operating expenses to be between $750 million and $770 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the third quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.80 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 318 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Dave.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks Bob. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook in calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. Despite the transitory issues we discussed earlier, it is clearer than ever that we have the right foundation for long-term growth and the right technology portfolio in place to ensure that we are successful in scaling our business. Over the last couple of years, we have made significant changes necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I\u2019m excited that we are starting to see the fruits of those changes. Before I finish today, I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on the CFO transition we announced earlier this afternoon. As you may have seen, we announced that Wissam Jabre will be joining Western Digital as Chief Financial Officer effective the week of February 7. Wissam was most recently Chief Financial Officer at Dialog Semiconductor. In addition to his deep financial and semiconductor expertise, Wissam also has technical expertise, and importantly, shares Western Digital\u2019s values of collaboration and innovation. You can read more about his background in the press release issued today. I\u2019d like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of the entire Board and management team to Bob for his dedication and hard work at the service of Western Digital. During my tenure as CEO, I\u2019ve greatly benefited from his friendship and expertise. He\u2019s been an essential part of our leadership team, guiding key aspects of our strategy. Among many other contributions, Bob drove a capital allocation strategy that has led to significant repayment of our debt, marked this quarter by Western Digital\u2019s second investment-grade corporate rating. Bob\u2019s insight was also instrumental in helping us navigate COVID uncertainty and execute other strategic changes at the company to position us for growth and value creation. Next quarter, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to hear from Wissam. I know he\u2019s looking forward to it. With that, Peter, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to dive into, obviously, the hard disk drive results. I mean, by my math, it looks like your capacity shift in nearline declined by about high teens or even 20% sequential. Can you help dissect the impact of your larger cloud customers having their own supply constraints relative to the comment of your own component availability? And then on top of that, gross margin in this next quarter, I know you alluded to, but how much COVID costs are you factoring into the gross margin expectation with 2 to 3 percentage points decline? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. I\u2019ll take a crack at it. Aaron thanks for the question and thanks for joining us, as always. So I don\u2019t think it was quite down quite as much as you said. I think we\u2019re kind of like mid-teens. A big piece of that is, we talked about it last quarter, we have one very, very large customer that\u2019s going through some challenges of their own. And now we have issues with our own supply chain. So I would say in the last quarter, it was primarily on the customer side. And as we went through the quarter, it started to creep in on our own components. And as we move into the next quarter, it\u2019s much more of a component issue as the rest of the market normalizes out or the customer normalizes out. On the COVID costs, you saw they are going up, and I\u2019ll let Bob comment through this in more detail. But the health and safety and logistics costs continue to go up. We\u2019ve seen that over the last couple of quarters, and now we\u2019re seeing component costs that are almost approaching that same level of spend as far as increases. So I thought I\u2019d give you some idea of sizing it. But Bob, you want to...\nBob Eulau: Yes. I can add a little more detail. I think that the COVID costs we\u2019ve been reporting, which are the logistics costs and the costs in the factory associated with keeping our employees safe, probably peaked in the second fiscal quarter at the $70 million. I think it will come down some in the third quarter, and hopefully, continue to come down from there. The logistics costs, as you know, have been elevated for probably at least six quarters now. The thing that\u2019s different as we look at the next quarter or two are the component costs, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of inflationary pressures on the component costs. We think those are transitory, a lot of expedite fees, a lot of expenses associated with trying to get the parts in so we can get the products built and delivered. So I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s different as we look forward the next quarter or two.\nDavid Goeckeler: The other thing, Aaron, I\u2019ll just wrap up by saying, I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter, we\u2019re expecting right about on seasonality for our hard drive business. I would say earlier \u2013 midway through last quarter, we were hoping to do better than that because we saw the demand there. But there is a significant amount of unmet demand that we just can\u2019t meet given the component constraints. But even with all that included, we believe we\u2019re back on a more seasonal number.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess to follow-up on Aaron\u2019s question, can you speak to when you expect these constraints to no longer be a headwind? And as part of the higher component costs, is there a point in time where you can \u2013 where contracts can be renegotiated and you can increase those higher input costs in terms of your pricing?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So there is \u2013 first of all, thanks for the question and thanks for joining us again. There is a lot to unpack in that question. Let me take a bit of a crack at it. So the component constraints are not necessarily new. We\u2019ve been dealing with them for a long time. I think early in the pandemic, we were able to qualify additional component suppliers, diversify. And then as things went on, we would always remix and do what we could to get the most out of the components we could get. It\u2019s just gotten to the point now where it\u2019s getting even more constrained. And quite frankly, a little bit more surprises that orders that we thought were going to show up get either delayed or canceled. So we continue to work through that. So to your point, there is a number of dynamics about why it gets better. One, we stay very close to our suppliers, and we will obviously work many quarters into the future. And we can see as we get through the first half of the year, things get better. We also \u2013 the technology moves forward. And in some cases, we just move on to different nodes in the semiconductor business that have more availability on them. So we know as the portfolio shifts, things are going to free up. And then to your point, the longer it goes, we can negotiate longer contracts and kind of look at the relationship with all of our suppliers to get back to a position where we have more predictability both on the supply side and on the pricing side of it.\nC.J. Muse: That\u2019s very helpful. And as my follow-up on the NAND side of things, I think you\u2019ve historically talked about the transactional market kind of as a leading indicator. And so curious, as you look into March, how are you thinking about pricing? And I know you don\u2019t guide pricing, but curious, is there a larger headwind like-for-like or on a blended basis as you sit here today and consider the likely mix?\nDavid Goeckeler: I would say pricing is \u2013 look, I mean, I said it in the script. Pricing has stabilized in the more transactional markets. I think there was a little bit \u2013 I think the narrative in the industry given some of the shutdowns that are going on, would it flow through immediately? We haven\u2019t seen that. But we did see a stabilization. Also it\u2019s worth noting that majority of the portfolio is priced before we go into the quarter, and that happened before any of the events of the shutdowns in China. So that\u2019s not going to show up for another quarter or two. But I would say we\u2019re seeing more stabilization. Our view, I think, has been that we will see better pricing in the second half, and that\u2019s pretty much the way it\u2019s playing out. Depending on kind of the impacts of some of the shutdowns, that may move forward a little bit. But I think mainly the impacts of what we\u2019ve seen \u2013 impact on NAND pricing is going to be more second half favorable, including some of the stuff we\u2019re seeing now on even the tool vendors, the component issues hitting them. So we\u2019re watching that very closely. I would say right now, we\u2019ve got a more stable environment over the last 2, 3 weeks.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Just following up on the NAND question, you guys have been going through this BiCS5 transition, and I know part of that has sort of \u2013 as you\u2019re waiting for controllers and qualifications that you end up in those more transactional markets. Where are you from a mix standpoint? Is that still a negative impact in the March quarter? And do you see that at some point reversing as you start to get traction in other markets with BiCS5?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Joe, thanks for the question. So definitely, as we go through the year, the mix gets better on BiCS5. It starts out in more transactional markets. Consumer, it\u2019s moved into mobile, it\u2019s into gaming. This quarter, we will start to ramp client and then more of that as we go through the year. And then in the second half of the year, we will ramp BiCS5 into enterprise SSD. And that\u2019s really where the whole enterprise SSD story comes together. We\u2019ve got \u2013 this year, we went through all the qualifications. That\u2019s BiCS4 material right now, which is in shorter supply. And then as we ramp that into BiCS5 throughout the year, the mix gets better as we go throughout the year. So it\u2019s a really important point and one of the reasons why when we talk about the setup for 2022, as we go forward, the portfolio gets stronger.\nJoe Moore: Great. And then in NAND, I don\u2019t know if you mentioned because I\u2019ve been on multiple calls, but have you had constraints from SSD controllers as well as HDD and power management, anything else that\u2019s constraining on the NAND side of the business?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I would say the NAND \u2013 the business we\u2019re leaving on the table in the NAND business is higher than in the drive business. It\u2019s significant in the drive business, in the order of $100 million to $150 million in the third quarter there. But in the Flash business, it\u2019s basically twice that. So yes, it\u2019s controllers, it\u2019s power ICs, it\u2019s a number of different parts on enterprise SSDs and embedded as well.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. It\u2019s great to see crossover of BiCS5 this quarter. But may you discuss the timing of ramping BiCS6? I ask given your plans to reduce cash CapEx and expectations for a moderation in NAND cost declines. And I have a follow-up, please.\nDavid Goeckeler: So we expect \u2013 so first of all, let me talk about how we think about ramping different nodes. I mean the main thing we\u2019re looking at is the cost side of it. So the cost numbers, good again this quarter. We expect that to revert closer to the $15 million that we always talk about modeling. It\u2019s been above it, I think, for nine quarters in a row now. But still, the nodes are producing, and we\u2019re getting the cost we need as we go forward. We \u2013 BiCS4 was a great node for us on yields, record yields. We expect BiCS5 to be \u2013 that BiCS5 is the most capital-efficient node the team has ever built. And so at this point, we expect BiCS6 to be in FY \u201823 type of ramp. We\u2019ve got lots of runway on BiCS5.\nKarl Ackerman: I appreciate that. For my follow-up, there have been some investor concerns that channel inventory has been increasing for non-enterprise hard drives and retail areas of the NAND market. I\u2019m curious whether that\u2019s the case for you. It doesn\u2019t appear that way given the constraints you are seeing from a component perspective. But if you could just discuss the level of visibility and the amount of channel inventory you see or the leanness of that, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything noteworthy that\u2019s particularly out of the norm across the portfolio. We talked a little bit about some stuff last quarter that\u2019s normalized. So there is really nothing to call out. I don\u2019t know Bob, is there anything to come to mind from your perspective?\nBob Eulau: No. I think we\u2019re within normal ranges in every region.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Karl.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. I want to go back to the supply chain dynamics for HDD. And now, that \u2013 two follow-ups here, now that you\u2019re actually impacted by component shortages, is that \u2013 if you were willing to pay a higher premium, would you actually be able to procure the components you needed? Is that just holding going on in the supply chain or just the parts are not available, no matter how much a premium you\u2019re willing to pay? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I think there is a premium to get them. And so we have good contracts with our suppliers. So \u2013 but there are premiums to get the pieces. But like I said, there is just more variability on timing, especially in the fact that orders that have been placed many, many, many quarters in advance, then we get push-outs. I think your question is, are we just not paying for them? Are they available? And I think it\u2019s a mix. I mean we\u2019re definitely \u2013 we definitely have to pay more to get what we need, and there are some pieces that are just getting delayed and \u2013 especially later in the planning cycle where it\u2019s more difficult to mitigate the impacts.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. And a follow-up to that, when I look at your December quarter, you were impacted by one particular customer, and now it\u2019s a supply chain issue. Does that mean that we should expect a step-function in your HDD shipment, especially into the September quarter, or is the recovery in recouping these loss shipment and revenue is going to be more gradual?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Well, look, let\u2019s talk about it. I mean I think we are back on seasonality as we go into Q1. We obviously have a margin impact. We expect the revenue \u2013 Q3 to be the bottom on the revenue in that business. I think the margin will probably hit the bottom in the next quarter, but we will see some sequential growth. What I can say is when we look at calendar Q2, calendar Q3 through the end of the year, the demand signals from our customers are very strong. So, assuming we get the parts and like I said, especially in the drive business, as the portfolio transitions, we move on to different nodes that are freer as far as getting the controllers. That\u2019s why we have more confidence in the second half of the year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And Bob, good \u2013 best of luck in your next endeavor.\nBob Eulau: Alright. Thanks, Mehdi.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Mehdi.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I have got two as well. Dave, I guess you have been focused on, I guess shifting your ACD business from a more kind of transactional business to one that\u2019s more perhaps a little bit more strategic and longer term in terms of how you engage with your customers. Any progress on the LTA front over the past couple of quarters?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think the business is definitely changing. I mean we have talked about this for a couple of years. And let me just frame it up as a kind of where we were when we walked into 2021 and where are we when we walk into 2022. And so as we go into \u201822, we are clearly \u2013 we clearly have strong customer demand. I mean in the first quarter, we have more demand than we can meet. We have customers asking us for upsides. And we get good demand signals as we move through the year. The LTA percentage to your point, are multi-quarter agreements. I am starting to say a little more precise. On the drive business, when we walked into \u201821, we had \u2013 we knew were maybe a low to mid-single percent of our exabytes were going to go through agreements. And as we walk into \u201822, that\u2019s more like a third of the portfolio. So, you have seen a dramatic \u2013 we have seen a dramatic difference in what we understand about how much our customers are going to take, especially the biggest of the big customers, what their demand is going to look like, what are they committing to. That obviously helps us plan, that helps us work on pricing. So, it\u2019s a very, very different situation. From a portfolio point of view, we walked into calendar year \u201821 when we were talking about commercializing energy-assist. We walk into \u201822 not only having commercialized energy-assist and got the areal density gains from it, we have also launched OptiNAND. We got back on our front foot with 18 and ramped that. Now we are ramping 20. Something we talked about in the script, which has evolved over the year is we are seeing much more interest now from the big customers in SMR. That\u2019s something we have been investing in for many years. We have always thought it\u2019s been good technology. OptiNAND helps deliver a better SMR drive and better areal density. And we expect by the end of the year, we are going to have multiple cloud titans deploying SMR at scale. On the flash side of the business, we talked about BiCS5 and kind of where we are there and how that portfolio gets stronger throughout the year. And then I think as we go through \u201822, we are just in a better financial situation than we were before. To the \u2013 and as we talked about on the call, getting back to a shareholder return policy, which we are all very much looking forward to as we move into FY \u201823. So, maybe a little broader than your question, sorry, but we \u2013 LTAs in the drive business have become a meaningful increase in the percent of our exabytes and where they are going to be placed throughout the year.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, Dave, you mentioned at the very end of your response on the shareholder return aspect of the business, it\u2019s next fiscal year, which is great. What\u2019s sort of the internal debate when you think about dividend versus share repurchases? And just given the evolving macro backdrop and sort of the rate backdrop, any change in how you think about and how you approach capital allocation at a high level? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think we will have more to say about that as we get a little bit closer. I mean one of the things we are going to do is talk to our shareholders and get their input on that question, and then we will have more to say about it. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an internal debate just yet, but we are just really looking forward to getting to that point. We have spent 18 months now paying down well over $2 billion worth of debt. We have the ability \u2013 we have made a lot of changes in our execution in the portfolio to generate more cash, and we are looking forward to returning that to our shareholders.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks a lot. This is Jason Park on for Tim Arcuri. So, just I have one question. My question is on HDD. So, we just wanted to ask how your 20 terabyte is ramping throughout this calendar year. As you guys know, your competitor provided some color on this last night, saying there is 20 terabyte will be one of the fastest ramp ever. So, if you guys could provide any details on how your 18 terabyte and 20 terabyte ramp is going this year, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. 20 is \u2013 I guess what I would say is 20 terabyte is ramping. It\u2019s not going to ramp. It is ramping. I mean if I look at units shipped in the last quarter, we are up to a high-single digit percent already of units that are going out at 20 terabyte. And like I said, we see high interest because we have some very, very large customers going to SMR. And so you are going to get more bang for your buck there with the gains you get on SMR. And OptiNAND is a technology that makes that even more efficient. So, we feel really good about where 20 terabyte is. We feel good about where the technology is. And we think it\u2019s going to be a very successful ramp. I will just leave it at that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVijay Rakesh: Hi Dave and Bob. Just a question here, on your March quarter flash guide, I think you talked about price might be a little bit \u2013 pricing will be a little bit softer. Wondering, mix should be more positive for you guys, right, because mobile probably comes in and you have a better mix of, it might be retail and enterprise, etcetera. So, I was wondering why margins wouldn\u2019t be more stable in the flash side in the March quarter. And also, I think you mentioned component cost inflation. I was wondering if this is actual component costs or logistics costs, or what exactly the component cost inflation was? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: So, on the second one, it\u2019s actual component cost. Like what the suppliers mix of cost is a different thing. I mean obviously, wafers are going up. But for us, it\u2019s just the cost of the component itself. On your mix question, yes, mix gets better as we go forward because we go more into BiCS5 and more parts of the portfolio. I guess what I will say is the component impact on the portfolio \u2013 I mean one of the places the component impact on flash is hitting the portfolio is on enterprise HDD, which is\u2026\nPeter Andrew: Enterprise SSD.\nDavid Goeckeler: Enterprise SSD. Thank you, Peter. Enterprise SSD. So anyway, the component impact on the portfolio is a \u2013 component shortage impact on the portfolio is part of the equation there as well.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tom O\u2019Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTom O\u2019Malley: Hi. Good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my question. I just had two on the HDD business. One, I think, David, you have talked about seasonality or a more seasonal march. You have obviously seen some marches over the past 2 years that I would classify as less seasonal. Could you remind us what seasonality traditionally looks like in that business? And then the second one is you talked about gross margins over the next two quarters, going down 200 basis points to 300 basis points in the HDD business. Could you give us any color on the cadence there? Do you see a sharp fall off in March and a flattening in June, or is it a step-function for both quarters? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: First question\u2026\nBob Eulau: Was on seasonality.\nDavid Goeckeler: Right, seasonality, about 4%, right?\nBob Eulau: For the company overall, yes, usually down about 4% in the March quarter.\nDavid Goeckeler: And then, Bob, do you want to comment on gross margin, what it looks like in\u2026\nPeter Andrew: HDD.\nDavid Goeckeler: In HDD fiscal Q3, fiscal Q4?\nBob Eulau: Yes. Well, as I mentioned, we have two big headwinds right now. The one we have had for a while, which are the COVID costs, and we hope they peaked in the December quarter. We think they peaked in the December quarter at about $70 million, and it will come down some from there. The logistics costs have been persistent for quite a while. So, I think it really comes down to when we see more passenger traffic coming out of Asia, which will be able to get the cargo rates down. So, that\u2019s one headwind we continue to have. And then on the component costs, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we are really expecting those to persist through the fourth quarter. And we expect them to get better as we go through the year, as Dave mentioned, as some of the controllers get on different nodes and we are able to see more supply available. But I think through the fourth quarter, we will continue to have a challenge.\nTom O\u2019Malley: Thanks for the color.\nBob Eulau: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Probably a question for Bob, but when you talk about those COVID costs kind of peaking, I think you said December quarter peaking. Can they come off pretty quickly if the COVID pandemic ends up for spring and summer kind of going away and critical mass of people overcome it? Just kind of curious about how quick they can go away, or is that too optimistic to think that they could go away, hopefully as fast as warmer temperatures come around?\nBob Eulau: Yes. I mean I think that \u2013 as I mentioned, the real driver is there is very little passenger traffic coming out of Asia right now. And so there is a lot of cargo on those flights in normal times. So, obviously, we are seeing good indications. A lot of the countries are starting to open up and say they are going to open up in the spring. Then you have to see the passenger travel come back and then obviously, you have to negotiate with the carriers and see the rates come down. So, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to be super quick, but I think that it will come down over the course of the year.\nJim Suva: Great. Thanks so much.\nBob Eulau: Sure.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Just a basic one from me. I understand how different nodes on the controller side can help, and some things are out of your control in terms of freight costs, as you just mentioned. But I am just struggling to \u2013 with the idea that in a couple of quarters, you feel that some of these supply chain issues will be more manageable. Is there anything else you guys are doing to control your own destiny that makes it sort of a little bit different in terms of your outlook, say, out into September, December? And Bob, congratulations, and I always appreciate working with you. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So, I think we are doing everything we can. I mean we are \u2013 I mean we always look to diversify our supply chain, especially in this kind of environment. We are staying very close to our suppliers to understand exactly they understand what we need, and we understand what they can provide. Like I said, there has been more variability in that lately. We are redoubling our efforts there to get close to it. And I think when we look \u2013 we plan many, many quarters in the future. And so when we look at where we are at, if we can get the surprises out of there, which we think will get better as more of the nodes in the fab start to free up, we will be able to be in a better position. And like I said, there are some big issues. When you roll the portfolio forward, you change the bomb of the product, and that gives you a different set of components that you are using. So, when you look at that planning is what gives us confidence on the second half.\nSteven Fox: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much.\nBob Eulau: And thanks, Steve. Appreciate your comments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon guys and appreciate you guys taking the question. And Bob, yes, really enjoyed working with you as well.\nBob Eulau: Thank you.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. I guess my question is sticking with 20 terabytes. Guys, do the component constraints, do those impede the velocity of the ramp through the year? And I believe in the past, you had talked about maybe reaching kind of 20 TB crossover sometime midyear and is that still the case? Thanks a lot.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. The component situation is better on 20, I mean is maybe a better way of saying what I said earlier. But \u2013 so I mean, at this point, there is no impeding of that roadmap, right, and that ramp. Where we are running into problems is controllers on 18s because that\u2019s where 75% to 80% of the portfolio is right now, and that\u2019s the sweet spot of what customers are deploying. So, I think as we move through the year and we move into 20, I mean we will get things to free up. We will get closer to our suppliers and get more capacity on the current products as well. But as we move forward, we also have some other dynamics that help us.\nAnanda Baruah: That\u2019s super helpful. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Just a follow-up to one of the previous questions on, I guess the cost side of things. Obviously, some of the costs are transitory when it comes to supply chain. But it\u2019s no secret that the semiconductor pricing, IC pricing, has gone up, perhaps on a permanent basis. So, I am just curious, Dave, as you kind of talk to your customers, what sort of conversations are you having with your customers? And I am trying to understand your ability to pass through some of these permanent cost increases as we go through the next few quarters.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So, we work \u2013 I mean I think this goes back to the conversation we had earlier on multi-quarter agreements. I mean we have been working with our customers quite a bit on what their future looks like and what they are planning. That gives us more certainty in the process. And quite frankly, that\u2019s helped to stabilize pricing in this environment. I mean \u2013 the first order of business is to be as close to our customers and mitigate these costs through staying aligned with them. If it gets to the point where there is \u2013 we think they are going to be long-term, then of course, well, the economics of the industry will have to reset to drive the continued investment to drive the exabyte growth. So, it\u2019s a little bit of how we are thinking about it right now. It\u2019s \u2013 we see them subsiding as the supply chain loosens up and we drive the technology forward. If our calculation is off on that, then we will look at all the other levers we have in the business.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. And Bob, thank you for all your help, and good luck.\nBob Eulau: Thank you. Appreciate it, Srini.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nNik Todorov: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me and thanks for taking the question. We talked about the LTAs on the HDD side. I wonder what is the appetite from customers for doing LTAs on the NAND side, particularly on the enterprise SSD business and maybe on the client SSD side, as supply is obviously impacting?\nDavid Goeckeler: I would say \u2013 I mean, definitely LTAs are the routine way the NAND market works with OEMs and anybody that\u2019s buying on a consistent basis. So, that\u2019s been a part of the market for a long time. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we are borrowing some of those ideas and moving over to the drive business. Again, I talked about earlier why I am more confident in \u201822 as we walk into the year and as we go forward. On the NAND side, the percentage of the portfolio under LTAs has gone up as well. I mean when we walked into last year, it was over \u2013 it was already over half of the portfolio. We walk into this year, it\u2019s more like two-thirds. And realize we have a big percentage of our portfolio in consumer markets in the channel. So, those are not things where you think about multi-quarter agreements with your customers. But in the NAND market, it\u2019s just the way business is done is to negotiate share for different products with customers and then of course, on a quarterly basis, negotiate price within that share envelope. And then there is always the opportunity for upsides beyond that share amount. And we are seeing a fair amount of that right now in the NAND business. There is a lot of customers coming to us PC customers, enterprise SSD customers looking for upside in NAND. So, that \u2013 again, that makes us optimistic. When we talk about strong demand signals that\u2019s one of them that gives us confidence in the year. We will manage through the component issues. And we feel super good about where the roadmap is, where the technology that\u2019s underpinning this is. We feel good about the customer relationships and demand signals. And again, to wrap it all up, we spent 1.5 years getting the company in a much stronger financial position. And we look forward to getting back to a shareholder return policy. So \u2013 but again, to summarize your question, LTAs, much, much more prevalent in the NAND business.\nNik Todorov: Got it. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you. Alright. Is that it, Peter?\nPeter Andrew: Yes.\nDavid Goeckeler: Alright. Thanks. Look, everyone, we really appreciate you joining us today. We will be talking throughout the quarter, and we will look forward to engaging then. Thank you very much.\nBob Eulau: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2022 results. We delivered strong results for the fiscal second quarter, with revenue of $4.8 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 33.6%, both of which are within the guidance range we provided last quarter. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, which was ahead of our expectations. I am proud of the team as this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding guidance amid a continuously increasingly challenged supply chain. Before I go over the detailed results and business trends, I want to offer some important key takeaways coming out of calendar year 2021. First, we have made significant progress in strengthening our product portfolio. We delivered on our goals of qualifying our enterprise SSD products at 3 cloud titans and 2 OEMs, commercializing energy-assisted hard drives as well as commencing shipments of 20-terabyte hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. These products address the large and fast growing opportunities within the cloud for storage. Second, demand for Western Digital storage solutions across cloud, client and consumer end markets remains consistently strong. We are optimistic about our outlook for calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate solid demand across the end markets we serve. I will share more about that demand and other macro factors later. Third, we are continuing to navigate an increasingly complex supply chain, which is impacting both our customers' ability to ship products as well as our ability to build products. In order to meet our end customers' demand, we are incurring additional costs that will weigh primarily on our hard drive gross margins through the first half of calendar year 2022. These issues are transitory in nature, affecting both revenue and gross margin and we expect them to subside as the supply chain normalizes. We remain confident that the long-term growth and profitability opportunity in front of us has not changed. Lastly, we received an investment grade corporate rating from Fitch in December, which represents Western Digital's second investment grade corporate rating. This marks an important milestone as we have worked hard over the last 18 months to strengthen our financial position, providing us with greater financial flexibility in the future. As we approach our targeted debt levels, we look forward to reengaging in a capital return program in fiscal year 2023. Turning to our results, this past quarter, demand remained strong across our end markets and our customers and the Western Digital teams continue to work diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. In particular, cloud revenue for the fiscal second quarter increased by 89% from the same period last year. We continue to anticipate strength in storage demand, which is bolstered by our ability to continue to bring innovative new products to market to meet the needs of the digital economy. The potential of what can be accomplished through the creation of content and the ability to access digital information easily has never been greater. With our technology, we are enabling businesses, creators and innovators to think bigger and push their limits even further. Western Digital has built a great position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to innovate and develop a balanced portfolio, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a strong position to capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead of us. I will now recap our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, overall cloud end-market product demand remained high, with revenue increasing 50% year-over-year led by capacity enterprise hard drives. Although we were up strongly year-over-year, capacity enterprise hard drives declined sequentially after two quarters of strong shipments, partly due to some of our customers' supply chain challenges. As both Western Digital earned customers continue to face supply chain challenges, we will experience some near-term visibility issues. However, our overall demand signals continue to be very good as we move through the calendar year and we will be in a stronger position once these headwinds subside. During the fiscal second quarter, we commenced volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. We are very excited about OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the control plane to further increase areal density. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in customer interest in adopting SMR technology and expect multiple cloud titans to deploy SMR drives in high volume later in this calendar year. In Flash, revenue grew in the second fiscal quarter due to seasonal strength in mobile and consumer. Within mobile, shipments of our BiCS5 products into leading 5G smartphones increased over 60% sequentially and 50% year-over-year, led by strong content growth. BiCS5 shipments represented over 40% of total revenue and BiCS5 production crossover took place during the quarter as expected. The successful ramp of BiCS5 helped accelerate our overall year-over-year bit shipment growth to 37% in the quarter. Our WD_BLACK premium SSD product line optimized for the best gaming experience continues to gain momentum, with revenue increasing about 50% sequentially and doubling in calendar year 2021. Along with flash products for gaming consoles, revenue has grown from 0 to over 10% of our flash portfolio over the last 2 years. As consumers demand more ways to access, generate and store content, whether via gaming or the now emerging Metaverse, our strong and growing flash portfolio will be integral to enable all of these applications. In line with the guidance we provided last quarter, our client SSD business declined sequentially due to supply chain disruptions at some of our PC customers and pricing pressure in the more transactional markets. So far, within the current quarter, we are starting to see pricing in the more transactional markets stabilize. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise SSD products are qualified at 3 cloud titans and 2 major storage OEMs, marking significant progress compared to 1 cloud titan a year ago. As you know, this has been one of my top priorities. Building upon the early success of ramping BiCS5 into mobile and gaming consoles, we are further strengthening our product portfolio as we move through calendar year 2022. In client SSD, the bedrock of Western Digital's flash portfolio, we have launched and are ramping BiCS5-based products in the fiscal third quarter, with BiCS5 enterprise SSD products later in the year. For our next-generation 3D flash, we began initial commercial shipment of consumer flash devices based on our 162-layer BiCS6. Furthermore, we qualified and commenced revenue shipment of client SSDs based on QLC and BiCS5 technology in the fiscal second quarter. While still early in its evolution, we are starting to pave the way for the industry's adoption of QLC in the future and our next-generation BiCS6 node will play an important role in that evolution. Let me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. The accelerated digital transformation in the last 2 years has created a world that is more technology-enabled and technology-dependent than ever before. We anticipate these trends will continue to drive data storage growth across each end market we serve: cloud, client and consumer. Our customers remain optimistic about demand trends in calendar 2022, driven by capital investment for the cloud build-out, continued recovery in enterprise spending, growth in smart video applications, increased adoption in 5G phones, consumer gaming and emerging trends such as VR/AR devices. In cloud, our customers have announced a 36% year-over-year increase in capital investment for the cloud build-out. This coupled with an increase in enterprise spending and continued growth in smart video applications, is expected to drive growth for our flash and HDD products into this growing end market. In client, PC end demand has remained strong. Our customers are driving more consistent demand than the past several quarters and we see continued stabilization in 2022. PC unit shipment forecasts continue to be robust and significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we anticipate an eventual return to site to drive a mix shift towards commercial PCs, which tend to offer richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs. In mobile, the latest 5G phones have doubled NAND content from prior generation smartphones. We expect mobile device content to benefit as ongoing 5G adoption and new 5G-enabled applications are expected to drive the storage demand in both endpoints in the cloud. In consumer, the highlight of this end market is our WD_BLACK SSD line of products optimized for gaming enthusiasts. Revenue more than doubled in calendar year 2021. The consumer recognition of the strength and value of WD_BLACK, along with the SanDisk and SanDisk Professional brands, drove a 34% year-over-year growth in average capacity per unit in consumer flash. While end customer demand in calendar 2022 looks promising, supply chain challenges are increasing. This both limits our ability to source components to meet customer demand and increases component costs. These costs are on top of the ongoing elevated logistics and health and safety COVID costs. While we believe these incremental costs are transitory and will subside as the supply chain conditions normalize, they will impact our results through the first half of this calendar year. Let me now turn the call over to Bob who will discuss our fiscal second quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for calendar year 2022. Bob? Thanks Bob. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook in calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. Despite the transitory issues we discussed earlier, it is clearer than ever that we have the right foundation for long-term growth and the right technology portfolio in place to ensure that we are successful in scaling our business. Over the last couple of years, we have made significant changes necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I'm excited that we are starting to see the fruits of those changes. Before I finish today, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the CFO transition we announced earlier this afternoon. As you may have seen, we announced that Wissam Jabre will be joining Western Digital as Chief Financial Officer effective the week of February 7. Wissam was most recently Chief Financial Officer at Dialog Semiconductor. In addition to his deep financial and semiconductor expertise, Wissam also has technical expertise, and importantly, shares Western Digital's values of collaboration and innovation. You can read more about his background in the press release issued today. I'd like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of the entire Board and management team to Bob for his dedication and hard work at the service of Western Digital. During my tenure as CEO, I've greatly benefited from his friendship and expertise. He's been an essential part of our leadership team, guiding key aspects of our strategy. Among many other contributions, Bob drove a capital allocation strategy that has led to significant repayment of our debt, marked this quarter by Western Digital's second investment-grade corporate rating. Bob's insight was also instrumental in helping us navigate COVID uncertainty and execute other strategic changes at the company to position us for growth and value creation. Next quarter, you'll have an opportunity to hear from Wissam. I know he's looking forward to it. With that, Peter, let's begin the Q&A. Okay. I'll take a crack at it. Aaron thanks for the question and thanks for joining us, as always. So I don't think it was quite down quite as much as you said. I think we're kind of like mid-teens. A big piece of that is, we talked about it last quarter, we have one very, very large customer that's going through some challenges of their own. And now we have issues with our own supply chain. So I would say in the last quarter, it was primarily on the customer side. And as we went through the quarter, it started to creep in on our own components. And as we move into the next quarter, it's much more of a component issue as the rest of the market normalizes out or the customer normalizes out. On the COVID costs, you saw they are going up, and I'll let Bob comment through this in more detail. But the health and safety and logistics costs continue to go up. We've seen that over the last couple of quarters, and now we're seeing component costs that are almost approaching that same level of spend as far as increases. So I thought I'd give you some idea of sizing it. But Bob, you want to... The other thing, Aaron, I'll just wrap up by saying, I mean, as we look forward into the next quarter, we're expecting right about on seasonality for our hard drive business. I would say earlier \u2013 midway through last quarter, we were hoping to do better than that because we saw the demand there. But there is a significant amount of unmet demand that we just can't meet given the component constraints. But even with all that included, we believe we're back on a more seasonal number. Sure, thanks. Yes. So there is \u2013 first of all, thanks for the question and thanks for joining us again. There is a lot to unpack in that question. Let me take a bit of a crack at it. So the component constraints are not necessarily new. We've been dealing with them for a long time. I think early in the pandemic, we were able to qualify additional component suppliers, diversify. And then as things went on, we would always remix and do what we could to get the most out of the components we could get. It's just gotten to the point now where it's getting even more constrained. And quite frankly, a little bit more surprises that orders that we thought were going to show up get either delayed or canceled. So we continue to work through that. So to your point, there is a number of dynamics about why it gets better. One, we stay very close to our suppliers, and we will obviously work many quarters into the future. And we can see as we get through the first half of the year, things get better. We also \u2013 the technology moves forward. And in some cases, we just move on to different nodes in the semiconductor business that have more availability on them. So we know as the portfolio shifts, things are going to free up. And then to your point, the longer it goes, we can negotiate longer contracts and kind of look at the relationship with all of our suppliers to get back to a position where we have more predictability both on the supply side and on the pricing side of it. I would say pricing is \u2013 look, I mean, I said it in the script. Pricing has stabilized in the more transactional markets. I think there was a little bit \u2013 I think the narrative in the industry given some of the shutdowns that are going on, would it flow through immediately? We haven't seen that. But we did see a stabilization. Also it's worth noting that majority of the portfolio is priced before we go into the quarter, and that happened before any of the events of the shutdowns in China. So that's not going to show up for another quarter or two. But I would say we're seeing more stabilization. Our view, I think, has been that we will see better pricing in the second half, and that's pretty much the way it's playing out. Depending on kind of the impacts of some of the shutdowns, that may move forward a little bit. But I think mainly the impacts of what we've seen \u2013 impact on NAND pricing is going to be more second half favorable, including some of the stuff we're seeing now on even the tool vendors, the component issues hitting them. So we're watching that very closely. I would say right now, we've got a more stable environment over the last 2, 3 weeks. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Joe, thanks for the question. So definitely, as we go through the year, the mix gets better on BiCS5. It starts out in more transactional markets. Consumer, it's moved into mobile, it's into gaming. This quarter, we will start to ramp client and then more of that as we go through the year. And then in the second half of the year, we will ramp BiCS5 into enterprise SSD. And that's really where the whole enterprise SSD story comes together. We've got \u2013 this year, we went through all the qualifications. That's BiCS4 material right now, which is in shorter supply. And then as we ramp that into BiCS5 throughout the year, the mix gets better as we go throughout the year. So it's a really important point and one of the reasons why when we talk about the setup for 2022, as we go forward, the portfolio gets stronger. Yes. I would say the NAND \u2013 the business we're leaving on the table in the NAND business is higher than in the drive business. It's significant in the drive business, in the order of $100 million to $150 million in the third quarter there. But in the Flash business, it's basically twice that. So yes, it's controllers, it's power ICs, it's a number of different parts on enterprise SSDs and embedded as well. Sure. Thanks. So we expect \u2013 so first of all, let me talk about how we think about ramping different nodes. I mean the main thing we're looking at is the cost side of it. So the cost numbers, good again this quarter. We expect that to revert closer to the $15 million that we always talk about modeling. It's been above it, I think, for nine quarters in a row now. But still, the nodes are producing, and we're getting the cost we need as we go forward. We \u2013 BiCS4 was a great node for us on yields, record yields. We expect BiCS5 to be \u2013 that BiCS5 is the most capital-efficient node the team has ever built. And so at this point, we expect BiCS6 to be in FY \u201823 type of ramp. We've got lots of runway on BiCS5. Yes. I don't think it's anything noteworthy that's particularly out of the norm across the portfolio. We talked a little bit about some stuff last quarter that's normalized. So there is really nothing to call out. I don't know Bob, is there anything to come to mind from your perspective? Thank you, Karl. Well, I think there is a premium to get them. And so we have good contracts with our suppliers. So \u2013 but there are premiums to get the pieces. But like I said, there is just more variability on timing, especially in the fact that orders that have been placed many, many, many quarters in advance, then we get push-outs. I think your question is, are we just not paying for them? Are they available? And I think it's a mix. I mean we're definitely \u2013 we definitely have to pay more to get what we need, and there are some pieces that are just getting delayed and \u2013 especially later in the planning cycle where it's more difficult to mitigate the impacts. Yes. Well, look, let's talk about it. I mean I think we are back on seasonality as we go into Q1. We obviously have a margin impact. We expect the revenue \u2013 Q3 to be the bottom on the revenue in that business. I think the margin will probably hit the bottom in the next quarter, but we will see some sequential growth. What I can say is when we look at calendar Q2, calendar Q3 through the end of the year, the demand signals from our customers are very strong. So, assuming we get the parts and like I said, especially in the drive business, as the portfolio transitions, we move on to different nodes that are freer as far as getting the controllers. That's why we have more confidence in the second half of the year. Thanks, Mehdi. Yes. I think the business is definitely changing. I mean we have talked about this for a couple of years. And let me just frame it up as a kind of where we were when we walked into 2021 and where are we when we walk into 2022. And so as we go into \u201822, we are clearly \u2013 we clearly have strong customer demand. I mean in the first quarter, we have more demand than we can meet. We have customers asking us for upsides. And we get good demand signals as we move through the year. The LTA percentage to your point, are multi-quarter agreements. I am starting to say a little more precise. On the drive business, when we walked into \u201821, we had \u2013 we knew were maybe a low to mid-single percent of our exabytes were going to go through agreements. And as we walk into \u201822, that's more like a third of the portfolio. So, you have seen a dramatic \u2013 we have seen a dramatic difference in what we understand about how much our customers are going to take, especially the biggest of the big customers, what their demand is going to look like, what are they committing to. That obviously helps us plan, that helps us work on pricing. So, it's a very, very different situation. From a portfolio point of view, we walked into calendar year \u201821 when we were talking about commercializing energy-assist. We walk into \u201822 not only having commercialized energy-assist and got the areal density gains from it, we have also launched OptiNAND. We got back on our front foot with 18 and ramped that. Now we are ramping 20. Something we talked about in the script, which has evolved over the year is we are seeing much more interest now from the big customers in SMR. That's something we have been investing in for many years. We have always thought it's been good technology. OptiNAND helps deliver a better SMR drive and better areal density. And we expect by the end of the year, we are going to have multiple cloud titans deploying SMR at scale. On the flash side of the business, we talked about BiCS5 and kind of where we are there and how that portfolio gets stronger throughout the year. And then I think as we go through \u201822, we are just in a better financial situation than we were before. To the \u2013 and as we talked about on the call, getting back to a shareholder return policy, which we are all very much looking forward to as we move into FY \u201823. So, maybe a little broader than your question, sorry, but we \u2013 LTAs in the drive business have become a meaningful increase in the percent of our exabytes and where they are going to be placed throughout the year. Yes. I think we will have more to say about that as we get a little bit closer. I mean one of the things we are going to do is talk to our shareholders and get their input on that question, and then we will have more to say about it. So, I don't know if it's an internal debate just yet, but we are just really looking forward to getting to that point. We have spent 18 months now paying down well over $2 billion worth of debt. We have the ability \u2013 we have made a lot of changes in our execution in the portfolio to generate more cash, and we are looking forward to returning that to our shareholders. Thank you. Yes. 20 is \u2013 I guess what I would say is 20 terabyte is ramping. It's not going to ramp. It is ramping. I mean if I look at units shipped in the last quarter, we are up to a high-single digit percent already of units that are going out at 20 terabyte. And like I said, we see high interest because we have some very, very large customers going to SMR. And so you are going to get more bang for your buck there with the gains you get on SMR. And OptiNAND is a technology that makes that even more efficient. So, we feel really good about where 20 terabyte is. We feel good about where the technology is. And we think it's going to be a very successful ramp. I will just leave it at that. So, on the second one, it's actual component cost. Like what the suppliers mix of cost is a different thing. I mean obviously, wafers are going up. But for us, it's just the cost of the component itself. On your mix question, yes, mix gets better as we go forward because we go more into BiCS5 and more parts of the portfolio. I guess what I will say is the component impact on the portfolio \u2013 I mean one of the places the component impact on flash is hitting the portfolio is on enterprise HDD, which is... Enterprise SSD. Thank you, Peter. Enterprise SSD. So anyway, the component impact on the portfolio is a \u2013 component shortage impact on the portfolio is part of the equation there as well. Thank you. First question... Right, seasonality, about 4%, right? And then, Bob, do you want to comment on gross margin, what it looks like in... In HDD fiscal Q3, fiscal Q4? Thanks Jim. Yes. So, I think we are doing everything we can. I mean we are \u2013 I mean we always look to diversify our supply chain, especially in this kind of environment. We are staying very close to our suppliers to understand exactly they understand what we need, and we understand what they can provide. Like I said, there has been more variability in that lately. We are redoubling our efforts there to get close to it. And I think when we look \u2013 we plan many, many quarters in the future. And so when we look at where we are at, if we can get the surprises out of there, which we think will get better as more of the nodes in the fab start to free up, we will be able to be in a better position. And like I said, there are some big issues. When you roll the portfolio forward, you change the bomb of the product, and that gives you a different set of components that you are using. So, when you look at that planning is what gives us confidence on the second half. Yes. The component situation is better on 20, I mean is maybe a better way of saying what I said earlier. But \u2013 so I mean, at this point, there is no impeding of that roadmap, right, and that ramp. Where we are running into problems is controllers on 18s because that's where 75% to 80% of the portfolio is right now, and that's the sweet spot of what customers are deploying. So, I think as we move through the year and we move into 20, I mean we will get things to free up. We will get closer to our suppliers and get more capacity on the current products as well. But as we move forward, we also have some other dynamics that help us. Yes. So, we work \u2013 I mean I think this goes back to the conversation we had earlier on multi-quarter agreements. I mean we have been working with our customers quite a bit on what their future looks like and what they are planning. That gives us more certainty in the process. And quite frankly, that's helped to stabilize pricing in this environment. I mean \u2013 the first order of business is to be as close to our customers and mitigate these costs through staying aligned with them. If it gets to the point where there is \u2013 we think they are going to be long-term, then of course, well, the economics of the industry will have to reset to drive the continued investment to drive the exabyte growth. So, it's a little bit of how we are thinking about it right now. It's \u2013 we see them subsiding as the supply chain loosens up and we drive the technology forward. If our calculation is off on that, then we will look at all the other levers we have in the business. I would say \u2013 I mean, definitely LTAs are the routine way the NAND market works with OEMs and anybody that's buying on a consistent basis. So, that's been a part of the market for a long time. I think it's \u2013 we are borrowing some of those ideas and moving over to the drive business. Again, I talked about earlier why I am more confident in \u201822 as we walk into the year and as we go forward. On the NAND side, the percentage of the portfolio under LTAs has gone up as well. I mean when we walked into last year, it was over \u2013 it was already over half of the portfolio. We walk into this year, it's more like two-thirds. And realize we have a big percentage of our portfolio in consumer markets in the channel. So, those are not things where you think about multi-quarter agreements with your customers. But in the NAND market, it's just the way business is done is to negotiate share for different products with customers and then of course, on a quarterly basis, negotiate price within that share envelope. And then there is always the opportunity for upsides beyond that share amount. And we are seeing a fair amount of that right now in the NAND business. There is a lot of customers coming to us PC customers, enterprise SSD customers looking for upside in NAND. So, that \u2013 again, that makes us optimistic. When we talk about strong demand signals that's one of them that gives us confidence in the year. We will manage through the component issues. And we feel super good about where the roadmap is, where the technology that's underpinning this is. We feel good about the customer relationships and demand signals. And again, to wrap it all up, we spent 1.5 years getting the company in a much stronger financial position. And we look forward to getting back to a shareholder return policy. So \u2013 but again, to summarize your question, LTAs, much, much more prevalent in the NAND business. Thank you. Alright. Is that it, Peter? Alright. Thanks. Look, everyone, we really appreciate you joining us today. We will be talking throughout the quarter, and we will look forward to engaging then. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were better than our expectations, marking the seventh consecutive quarter that we have met or exceeded guidance. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 4% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Please note that this figure includes $70 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I will provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of ongoing supply chain issues and COVID-related challenges. In addition to this solid financial performance, we hit a major milestone this quarter in receiving an investment grade corporate rating from Fitch. This marks the company's second investment grade corporate rating. We are pleased to see that our work to build a stronger financial foundation is being recognized and is providing us with greater financial flexibility for the future. Additionally, we closed a public debt offering last December and amended our loan agreement with lenders in January, bringing the maturity of over 85% of our debt balance to 2026 and beyond. For more details, please refer to our earnings presentation. Turning to our end markets, cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.9 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 89% from a year ago. Supply chain disruptions impacted cloud hard drive deployments at certain customers, which led to a sequential decline in exabyte shipments in the fiscal second quarter. However, healthy overall demand for capacity enterprise drives, along with Western Digital's leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point, drove a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in exabyte shipments. The client end market represented 38% of total revenue at $1.9 billion flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. The continued ramp of 5G phones helped offset decline in both client SSD and client hard drive revenue, enabling total client revenue to stay flat. Client hard drives represent less than 15% of our HDD revenue. Lastly, consumer represented 22% of revenue at $1.1 billion, up 9% sequentially and flat year-over-year. With a strong holiday season, retail flash led the sequential growth in consumer. On a year-over-year basis, growth in consumer flash was offset by a decline in consumer HDD. Turning now to revenue by segment, we reported flash revenue of $2.6 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 6% sequentially due to a seasonal increase in shipments to mobile and retail. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially. Flash bit shipments increased by 13% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments decreased by 14%, while the average price per hard drive decreased by 5% to $97. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 27%. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 33.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. As noted earlier, the COVID-related impact was $10 million higher than we anticipated at $70 million. Our flash gross margin was 36.1%, down 0.9 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $10 million or approximately 0.4 percentage points. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $60 million or approximately 2.7 percentage points. Operating expenses of $741 million were below our guidance range due to prudent cost control and lower variable compensation expense. Operating income was $882 million, representing a 7% decrease from the prior quarter and 157% increase year-over-year, highlighting our ability to drive profitable growth. Earnings per share, was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $666 million, and free cash flow was $407 million. Despite a slight increase in inventory due to supply chain disruption, we maintained strong cash flow generation in the quarter. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, with a cash outflow of $259 million. We remain prudent in investing in manufacturing capacity and continue to expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $3 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be around $1.5 billion as we actively manage our overall spending. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we fully repaid our Term Loan B in the amount of $943 million last October. In addition, last December, we closed a public offering of $1 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $1.3 billion on our Term Loan A, bringing our gross debt outstanding to $7.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. On top of that, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to revise the terms of our loan agreement to reflect our improved credit ratings and to extend the maturity of our term loan and revolving credit facility from 2023 to 2027. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5x. This compares to 3.0x in the third fiscal quarter of 2020, when we announced the plan to focus on debt repayment to achieve greater financial flexibility. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Considering the transitory supply chain challenges we discussed earlier, I would like to provide a bit more color on our view of both hard drive and Flash businesses in calendar 2022. Within our hard drive segment, we expect hard drive revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the third fiscal quarter. While the supply chain disruptions at some of our customers are expected to remain, the larger issue of late has been our ability to source components to meet customer demand. We expect revenue to return to sequential growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While overall hard drive pricing is expected to remain relatively stable, we expect gross margins to decline 2 to 3 percentage points from the fiscal second quarter through the fiscal fourth quarter due primarily to component cost inflation. Within our Flash segment, we expect Flash revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the fiscal third quarter driven by ASP. We expect Flash revenue to return to growth in the second half of calendar year 2022. Furthermore, we anticipate downward pressure on gross margins for the first half of this calendar year as cost reductions revert towards our long-term target of 15%. In regard to our fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.65 billion with a sequential revenue decline for both Flash and hard drive businesses. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect operating expenses to be between $750 million and $770 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the third quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.80 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 318 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave. Yes. I can add a little more detail. I think that the COVID costs we've been reporting, which are the logistics costs and the costs in the factory associated with keeping our employees safe, probably peaked in the second fiscal quarter at the $70 million. I think it will come down some in the third quarter, and hopefully, continue to come down from there. The logistics costs, as you know, have been elevated for probably at least six quarters now. The thing that's different as we look at the next quarter or two are the component costs, and we're seeing a lot of inflationary pressures on the component costs. We think those are transitory, a lot of expedite fees, a lot of expenses associated with trying to get the parts in so we can get the products built and delivered. So I think that's really what's different as we look forward the next quarter or two. No. I think we're within normal ranges in every region. Alright. Thanks, Mehdi. Was on seasonality. For the company overall, yes, usually down about 4% in the March quarter. Yes. Well, as I mentioned, we have two big headwinds right now. The one we have had for a while, which are the COVID costs, and we hope they peaked in the December quarter. We think they peaked in the December quarter at about $70 million, and it will come down some from there. The logistics costs have been persistent for quite a while. So, I think it really comes down to when we see more passenger traffic coming out of Asia, which will be able to get the cargo rates down. So, that's one headwind we continue to have. And then on the component costs, I mean it's \u2013 we are really expecting those to persist through the fourth quarter. And we expect them to get better as we go through the year, as Dave mentioned, as some of the controllers get on different nodes and we are able to see more supply available. But I think through the fourth quarter, we will continue to have a challenge. Sure. Yes. I mean I think that \u2013 as I mentioned, the real driver is there is very little passenger traffic coming out of Asia right now. And so there is a lot of cargo on those flights in normal times. So, obviously, we are seeing good indications. A lot of the countries are starting to open up and say they are going to open up in the spring. Then you have to see the passenger travel come back and then obviously, you have to negotiate with the carriers and see the rates come down. So, I don't know it's going to be super quick, but I think that it will come down over the course of the year. Sure. And thanks, Steve. Appreciate your comments. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it, Srini. Thanks, everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Mr. Peter Andrew. Thank you. Please go ahead. \nT. Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.\n Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements.\n Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to David for his introductory remarks. \nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 results. We reported revenue of $5.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49, all within the guidance ranges we provided in August. This marks the sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding guidance, a point that we are particularly proud of as we continue to navigate uncertainty and volatility in the market.\n Strong demand across diverse end markets, particularly for our cloud products, combined with Western Digital's strong innovation, broad routes to market and sharpened execution enabled us to deliver results within our guidance range despite significant COVID impacts and supply chain disruptions. While these disruptions are transitory, the long-term opportunities for Western Digital remain unchanged as the world's digital transformation continues to accelerate.\n During the quarter, we shipped a record level of exabytes, while also improving non-GAAP gross margins across both flash and HDD and generating profitable growth. We saw strong demand for our latest generation hard drives and flash products in the cloud end market as well as strong consumer demand for new 5G-based mobile phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 flash solutions. The strong demand for these products were partially offset by pressure in the commercial channel within the client end market and certain portions of the consumer end market, particularly retail. This was attributable to component issues impacting our customers' ability to ship products, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.\n Our continued focus on innovation and a more agile business unit structure enabled us to quickly adapt to these dynamics. When combined with an industry-leading portfolio and a strong go-to-market operation, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to continue to generate improved operational performance for all of our stakeholders. Before I get into the business trends, I want to highlight a few changes we made to our end market breakdown, which, we believe, will help you understand why Western Digital is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the increasing value and importance of data.\n We now split our end markets into cloud, client and consumer. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital, and we are uniquely positioned to address customer storage needs as the only provider of both hard drive and flash products. During the first quarter, cloud represented a record 44% of total revenue, led by record capacity enterprise hard drive revenue and nearly 30% sequential growth in enterprise SSD revenue.\n We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive growth in this end market and continue to shift our business mix towards the cloud. As we ramp our new innovative products and continue leveraging the benefits of the organization structure we put into place last September, I am confident we will capture opportunities to achieve a more stable and profitable growth profile over the long term.\n The client end market represented 37% of revenue in the first quarter. Here, we are providing a broad array of high-performance flash and hard drive solutions to our OEM and channel customers across PC, mobile, gaming, automotive, VR headsets, at-home entertainment devices and industrial spaces.\n Lastly, the consumer end market accounted for 19% of revenue in the first quarter. The highlight of this end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and the WD_BLACK brand of storage products for gaming enthusiasts, which is strong and growing. The brand recognition and infinity, combined with our unmatched reach with nearly 400,000 points of presence across the world is a great setup for Western Digital as we enter a seasonally stronger part of the year.\n With that, I'll now provide a recap of our HDD and flash businesses as it relates to our first quarter results. In HDD, continued strong demand for our latest generation energy-assisted drives among our cloud and enterprise customers drove record revenue and exabyte shipments in our cloud end market. In addition, we experienced strong revenue growth in our smart video product line, and we're unable to meet demand.\n During the quarter, we announced OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the HDD control plane to further increase aerial density. With this leading architecture, we achieved 20-terabyte capacity using our field-proven 9-disk mechanical platform and ePMR technology. Next month will commence volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technology. In flash, revenue grew in the quarter due to continued strong demand within the cloud and client end markets for our latest generation of our enterprise SSD products and the ramp of new 5G phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 node.\n Within enterprise SSD, we experienced continued success in the cloud with another successful quarter of qualifications. We are now qualified at 3 cloud titans and have made excellent progress working our way through the qualification process in the enterprise and distribution channels. We expect these qualifications to start to drive accelerated revenue growth in 2022 as our customers begin to deploy these products into their networks.\n The ramp of next-generation 5G phones incorporating our latest generation of BiCS5 products accelerated in the quarter, with revenue growing over 20% sequentially. We expect this migration to 5G, combined with a continued increase in the amount of storage per phone to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter. Gaming was strong in the quarter with a solid lineup of products for game consoles along with a growing brand recognition of WD_BLACK based products in the channel and retail.\n Heading into the second fiscal quarter, we are well positioned to take advantage of seasonal strength and grow in a wide variety of gaming channels. As I noted earlier, the client PC OEMs' distribution channel and retail were impacted by our customers' ability to ship product, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. Demand was solid, but these transitory issues impacted our ability to realize this demand in our results.\n In total, bit growth accelerated to 30% year-over-year in the first quarter as we ramp BiCS5 to 17% of flash revenue. This quarter, we expect year-over-year bit growth to further accelerate to the mid-30s range with BiCS5 bit crossover to happen later in the quarter.\n Our long-term goal is to grow bits in line with the market, taking advantage of our product and end market breadth to shift our bits to optimize profitability. As we look into calendar year 2022, we are optimistic as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. We have industry-leading technology, the right product portfolio and investments and the organizational agility to fundamentally drive improved profitability regardless of market condition.\n We have a great position in 2 large and growing markets in flash and HDD, and we have proven our ability to drive innovation throughout our portfolio and deliver industry-leading products to a broad and loyal customer base. We believe that the migration to the cloud and demand for storage solutions throughout the client and consumer markets will drive a huge opportunity for Western Digital and our customers.\n I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results. \nRobert Eulau: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance.\n Total revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.49. Please note that EPS included $56 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I'll provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to deliver such good results in the face of this unanticipated headwind and other supply chain issues.\n From a disclosure perspective, in addition to the change in our end market breakdown that Dave discussed, this quarter, we moved to segment reporting for our flash and hard drive businesses. For more details, please refer to our earnings deck.\n Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 44% of revenue at $2.2 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 72% from a year ago. This represented the second quarter in a row of record revenue. What is encouraging about this cloud revenue growth is the strength and breadth of our revenue streams across product areas. There was growth on a sequential basis in both the flash and hard drive business units as well as across every product category within the cloud, including capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, smart video and platforms. As the cloud continues to grow as a percentage of our revenue, we see an opportunity to reduce volatility in revenue and profitability. Over the last 3 quarters, we have successfully ramped our 18-terabyte energy-assisted drive to our highest volume mainstream product within the cloud end market.\n Overall, cloud HDD exabyte shipments grew 9% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year and comprised over 80% of total HDD exabyte shipments. Client represented 37% of revenue at $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. A highlight within the client end market was growth within our flash business unit, specifically in mobile, gaming, automotive, IoT and industrial applications. Our strength here was more than offset by pressure in desktop and notebook hard drives due to supply disruptions at our customers and within our own operations.\n Finally, consumer represented 19% of revenue at $973 million, down 6% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Both our flash and hard drive business units declined on a sequential basis due to similar supply disruptions in addition to uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.\n Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially, primarily due to mix and pricing within our transactional markets. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were flat. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.6 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 4%, while the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $102.\n As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 33.9%, up 1 percentage point sequentially. As noted earlier, this included $56 million in COVID-related costs or a 1.1 percentage point impact. These were highest COVID-related costs in over a year.\n Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our flash gross margin by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 37%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.9%, up 60 basis points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $51 million or approximately 2 percentage points.\n Operating expenses were $761 million, within our guidance range. Operating income was $952 million, representing a 15% increase from the prior quarter and tripling year-over-year, highlighting our profitable growth. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal first quarter was 11%.\n Earnings per share was $2.49, toward the top of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $521 million, and free cash flow was $224 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was a cash outflow of $297 million. We continue to expect gross CapEx for this fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion.\n In the fiscal first quarter, we paid off $213 million in debt, including a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.6 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, as a result of our strong financial results and free cash flow generation, last week, we repaid the remaining balance of our term Loan B in the amount of $943 million, bringing total gross debt outstanding to $7.7 billion.\n Our adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.2 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.0x, down from 2.7 a year ago and was the lowest in 3 years. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\n Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion and we expect flash revenue to increase sequentially and hard drive revenue to decline sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the second quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.95 and $2.25 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 316 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Dave. \nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Bob. I want to conclude by thanking the Western Digital team for their hard work and commitment to our customers throughout a challenging quarter. Despite the transitory issues we have been able to successfully navigate, it is clearer than ever Western Digital's innovative technology portfolio is foundational to the rapid digital transformation and transition to the cloud that the world is experiencing. With our deep roots in a broad range of end markets and a sharp focus on execution, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to capture this massive opportunity, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the fiscal year.\n Let's now begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. \nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, Aaron? \nAaron Rakers: Yes. Sorry guys. Can you hear me? \nRobert Eulau: No problem. We hear you. \nAaron Rakers: Sorry about that. Yes, so I've got 2 quick questions, if I can. I guess, first of all, it seems like there's a lot of moving parts in the quarter and more importantly, into the guidance outlook for fiscal 2Q. Bob, I'm just wondering if you can help quantify to your best estimate of how much impact you're carrying in revenue expectations relative to some of these \"transitory effect\"? \nRobert Eulau: Yes, it's difficult to quantify, right, because there's impact in terms of our own execution, which, I think, we worked our way through pretty well during the quarter. And then we have customers who have supply chain challenges as well where they're trying to get match sets and build out their environments. And then, of course, we have supplier challenges as well, where we're working like everybody else, pretty hard to get components in. So it's difficult to give you a definitive answer in terms of what the impact was in the quarter, we just closed or even obviously, in the next quarter. But it's certainly somewhere in the couple of hundred million dollar range and potentially a little worse in the December quarter. \nDavid Goeckeler: Aaron, this is Dave. First of all, thanks for the question. I guess the one thing I would say as well is, whereas maybe a quarter or 2 ago, we were seeing it in maybe certain parts of the business, some of the OEMs, PC OEMs. Now we're seeing it more broadly, even the big data center players are having their demand impact. Our demand from them is being impacted by their ability to get other components. So it's really become a much more broad-based issue across the portfolio. \nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then if I can follow up real quickly, one of the things that stands out to me is that I think you reported a blended ASP decline of about 3% sequential in the flash business. So I believe the mix of enterprise actually went up to the positive. So when I look at that ASP erosion relative to actually some of your peers in the NAND market, it seems to be a bit of a disconnect. Can you help me understand the pricing dynamics you're seeing in NAND right now? \nRobert Eulau: Yes, I can start, and then Dave can fill in. Yes, I mean, the blended ASP, as we started the quarter, we indicated we expected it to be down. And it was based on the mix we were anticipating. The mix came in essentially the way we had expected. And it was -- I don't want to get into every little detail of the mix. But one of the things we said at the beginning of the quarter was we expected more mobile volume in the September quarter, and that is what we saw. We actually think we'll see even more mobile as a percentage of the total in the December quarter. So mix is definitely a bit of a headwind for us. But really, ASPs are not going down that much. And we're really pleased with the cost reductions we've been able to achieve both in the quarter we just finished as well as what we're expecting to do this quarter. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I guess, Aaron, Bob right on the money on that. I guess the only thing I would add is a little bit of softness in some of the transactional and consumer markets, but that we're already seeing that level out a little bit. And we're really seeing this bifurcation where the qualified bits in the market are strong and unqualified are a little bit weaker. I guess that's not surprising given all the nodal transitions the industry is going through. But the primary issue, I would say that's the issue in mix, as Bob pointed out. And we expected that walking into the quarter. \nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess if I look at your revenue guide and kind of the commentary on NAND bits, it sounds like the implied HDD revenue guide is roughly down 15% sequentially. So I guess, A, is the math right there? And B, I guess, what's causing the severity of decline? Can you kind of help us understand what's digestion versus some of the transitory supply chain issues that you spoke to? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think that's probably a little -- we don't guide each individual business, but I think your number is probably a little heavy. You hit on some of the issues. Some of it is mix. We've actually got one of our very, very big customers that has their own supply chain issues that's pushing out some orders. So that's a bit of an idiosyncratic thing that's happening there. There's some supply chain issues with, especially in kind of mid-cap and the ability to build all of that supply we want. We talked about that even in this past quarter in the smart video market, which is strong and there's some unmet demand there.\n And then we've got -- we're seeing a little bit of an inventory issue, quite frankly, in China, where there's a lot of high-cap inventory there, and that's kind of pulling the number down a little bit for the next quarter. But we -- so we expect all those things are transitory issues. We're really happy about the portfolio. I think the fact that AT&T was now -- the majority of the portfolio, we talked about shipping 20-t on a 9-disk platform and OptiNAND is out there and in customers' hands. So we feel really good about the innovation that was delivered in the quarter and about where the road map is going in the drive business and the new technology has been very well received. \nChristopher Muse: That's great. And I guess as my follow-up, Bob, could you speak to how we should be thinking about gross margins into the first half of '22? Obviously, there's certain unknowns in terms of revenues and NAND pricing. But would love to hear perhaps some of the other puts and takes that we should be thinking about as well as the timing of when you think some of the COVID-related costs may abate? \nRobert Eulau: Yes, C.J., you're right. It's difficult to say exactly what's going to happen over the next few quarters. But -- and as you know, we only give guidance 1 quarter at a time. Now having said that, we're pretty optimistic on 2022. Again, we think a lot of the challenges in the quarter we closed, in the quarter we're in now are really supply chain related. We think the underlying demand situation is very positive. We really believe, as I said in our cost reduction plans, and we think we'll be able to deliver solid margins. So I don't want to get into giving guidance for next year, but we're definitely optimistic. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could update us on where you are with BiCS5 qualification? I assume saying you'll be mobile heavy this quarter. It means you're kind of still getting qualified across the SSD markets? And I had a follow-up. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I think that's right. I mean it's early in the node. We are happy with the ramp this quarter. We ended at, I think, 17% BiCS5, and we expect to get crossover before we exit the year. But like any new node, you're in more of the mobile components market as the rest of the products get qualified, but that's all work underway. And our customers are definitely pulling us in that direction. They want BiCS5 on the SSD products and the engineers are hard at work at getting that work done. That will be an evolving story as we work through '22. \nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. And then I think you referenced some of the segments in client SSD maybe being a little weaker. Can you separate out? Is there a Chi effect there where it was good for a while and then it was less good versus just overall client SSD being oversupplied because of other issues in the supply chain. Like how do you sort that out? And what do you see happening in the client SSD market? \nDavid Goeckeler: I don't think we see it as a Chi effect. I mean, I was just talking to our sales team this morning, and I think the channel has now kind of normalized and back on seasonality after the Chi disruption. I think we just see this issue with people not able to get all the components they need to put together the full kit for what they want to ship, and that's causing some softness in the channel. So I think it's more related to that than it is anything Chi related, at least in my view. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. \nKarl Ackerman: Bob, earlier in a response to a question, you had indicated some of the impact or challenge in your enterprise, I believe, HDD business and SSD business was a result of a push out by a customer. My question there is if we isolate that customer, how do you see the demand trajectory of cloud in mass capacity markets not just into the December quarter, but also into the second half of your fiscal year? Certainly, as you begin to ramp some of these 20 terabyte drives and other higher capacity drives in HDDs as well as some of these new design wins you have in enterprise SSD. \nRobert Eulau: Do you want me to take that or you? \nDavid Goeckeler: I can start. \nRobert Eulau: Okay. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So I think as a general statement, we're seeing continued very strong demand from our data center customers, especially we've very big data center customers. They're giving us good signals about next year and what they plan to do. It's hard to pin that down to a certain quarter right now, but we continue to see very strong demand there. Like I said, we're starting to see the supply chain impact show up there as well. But I'm sure that will all get worked through as we go through the year. But we look into '22, and we have our customers telling us, it continues to be a strong demand environment. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I don't think I have anything to add. I mean we believe in the cloud demand. I think it's strong, and there just is a lot of supply chain dislocation right now. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nUnknown Executive: This is actually [ John ] on behalf of Wamsi. Just curious, there has been a lot of media focus on Kioxia. And in the past, Western Digital has expressed interest in the asset. Do you think that consolidation still make sense? And do you still have an appetite for it? \nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean I think I'll speak in general about Kioxia. They're a tremendous JV partner. And we've spoken a lot about the JV and what the benefits of that are. And all the -- I think one of the highlights of the quarter is the continued production of the flash road map and BiCS5 and the cost situation that, that's driving. I mean I think it's always been a very big focus of the Western Digital and Kioxia team to very focus on capital efficiency and cost downs in the portfolio. Those -- the seeds for BiCS5 performance that we're seeing now were shown many years ago. That continues to be a great focus of the joint teams. And I think the fact that we have a joint road map with another supplier as big as Kioxia gives us a lot of investment in our road map.\n And then, of course, we produce together as well and have a lot of synergies there as well. So it's a great partnership. We -- it's been going for over 20 years now. It's going to go for -- we're signed up for at least another decade. And we always look at that as we continue to invest in fabs, and we're really happy with the partnership, and we're going to continue to get the best out of it. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Two questions. The first one is for the team. Obviously, there is a long lead time associated with the equipment procurement. So at this point, I would think that you have a pretty good feel for a bit, NAND, bit supply growth in calendar year '22. Is there any color you can share with us? And I have a follow-up. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I mean we do have good visibility, and you saw our bit growth came back up again this quarter. We expect it to be a bit higher year-over-year next quarter. Our long-term goal continues to be to grow at the rate the market is growing, and we won't get that perfectly every quarter, but that's our objective. And we think that, again, with Kioxia, we've got the right plans in place for next year. \nMehdi Hosseini: But what is the target for next year, calendar year? \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I don't think we put a specific number out there yet. Some of the industry analysts suggesting industry demand growth in the low 30% range. \nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And given the fact that your enterprise and cloud customers are expressing a good solid demand in calendar year '22. Have you determined how to allocate, and perhaps I'm trying to better understand how you're thinking about the mix between cloud enterprise and client and consumer. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think we're certainly having those discussions with them. I mean, I think every quarter, we discussed the current quarter and out many quarters -- several quarters in advance at least, I mean, we don't lock in per se on those numbers exactly, but we think about share of their particular businesses and what that's going to look like and what that means to demand for us. So yes, we're having those conversations, and we're factoring them into the mix of bits for next year and how we allocate across the portfolio. Of course, there's a nodal mix equation of that as well as it's kind of referred to in the previous question, when are different products available on different nodes out of the fab. So we're working through all that right now. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: I want to go back to the HDD guidance and just maybe ask around what the normalized base of revenue is. I mean, obviously, your peer guided flat, you're down kind of like low teens. It sounds like something in the range of $2.25 billion in that range. It sounds like part of that is a push out and some of that some company-specific issues on the supply side. So can you help us bridge the gap there? Is it -- is 2.6% kind of flat like the normalized level if you adjust for all that? Or is it something that's slightly down Q-on-Q, but not down low teens? \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I mean, again, it's hard to quantify exactly what the supply chain impacts were, and we're actually not giving guidance by segment, but we definitely believe the hard drive business is a growth business and it will continue to grow over the next few quarters. We think 2022 will be a strong year. And yes, this is a bit of an aberration in the December quarter, but it's -- the business is really solid. The underlying demand is very good. And you're right. I mean we already commented that there are some supply chain issues that are impacting us right now. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: Dave, I wanted to ask about enterprise SSDs. You talked about now being qualified 3 cloud titans, which is great. You also talked about some of these wins translating into revenue growth and potentially driving an acceleration and growth in '22. Can you help us kind of shape the ramp into '22? Could it be more first half weighted, second half weighted? I know these projects can move around a little bit. But any help there would be really, really helpful. And then related to that, the impact on profitability as you ramp that business, initially, would it be a headwind and then eventually a tailwind? Or should it be fairly margin neutral from the get-go? \nDavid Goeckeler: Toshi Hari, so first of all, yes, we are really happy with the progress of the portfolio. I remember sitting here a year ago, and we were just trying to get over the hump on the first one, and now we're over 3 of them, and we continue to work at the OEMs, which the enterprise OEMs, which tend to be longer call cycles, and we're making good progress there as well. And you're right. We'll -- we got the calls done. We'll start to see some -- a little bit of deployment next quarter and then start to ramp it throughout '22. So I think it's an evolving story as we go throughout the year. From what is -- I think it's a very attractive TAM. I think with good margins, and that's why we're investing in the products. And I think as we mix more into that and have more supply into that, it's a tailwind for the overall portfolio. That's definitely a true statement. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. \nAnanda Baruah: Yes, I guess my question would be for whatever it is that you guys consider to be the revenue impact to the December quarter guide, could you just sort of anecdotally map out for us, how much is from the flash business relative to HDD? And then inside of HDD, how much would be from the impact of kind of the cloud type. It sounds like there's some component stuff on their side there? And then you had mentioned some channel dynamics and some WD dynamics as well on the PC business. That would be helpful. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I mean this is -- I'm trying to think how to answer this question differently. I mean we're actually not giving guidance by segment. However, we did say we expect revenue to be down a bit on the hard drive side. We expect it to be up sequentially on the flash side. There are supply chain challenges in -- with some cloud customers. There are supply chain challenges with some PC OEMs. We also mentioned that there seems to be a fair amount of inventory in China right now. So there's -- there definitely are some short-term challenges with respect to the hard drive business. But again, long term, the underlying growth is really good there. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. \nVijay Rakesh: Just had a couple of quick questions. On the client SSD side, as you look at next year, just wondering how you're thinking, what the outlook was. I know server looks pretty strong for next year. But on the client SSD side and on mobile too, how you are looking at next year's demand? \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We think the PC TAM is good next year. I mean we're obviously coming off of a blockbuster year with COVID. I mean we see the pre-COVID baseline is around 265 million, 270 million units. That went up to 340 million this year expected around that number, and we see somewhere around 320 million to 335 million next year. So definitely been -- we're going to come off this year a little bit. But we're -- we see basically the baseline has been reset, pre-COVID by a significant amount. So we feel good about that. We're hearing that from our customers. We're talking to those customers now about 2022 plans and what they plan to do and how much supply they're going to need and share conversations with each of them and those conversations are going well.\n The smartphone market, again, we continue to see this past quarter and the quarter in, we're seeing really good strength in that market. So I think this is -- there's a larger point here about the flash market is that the number of end markets is just more diverse now, especially with enterprise SSD growing and getting to be such a big market that there's a much better mix of demand that we play across in the market. And so we see strength in PC. We see strength in smartphones. We see strength in data center.\n Like we said, the more transactional markets this past quarter is more nodal transitions going on. There was more bits available in those markets, and we definitely saw that. But again, we're heading into a seasonally strong quarter on retail. So as we go through the quarter, we'll get a very strong idea about how retail is going to play out as well as we go through the holiday season. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: Relates to hard drive business, earlier, you talked about inventory issues in China. Can you add a little color to that? How much are -- how much excess inventory are there? Do you think that will get back to normalized levels exiting the year? And any other geography you're watching out right now? \nDavid Goeckeler: That's the main geography we're watching, and it's mainly high capacity, and we think it will get worked through in the next quarter. But it's definitely in the channel and it's some of the big customers. So it's just something that's going to impact the amount of business that goes -- that flows through that part of the market, which is a pretty big market for all of us, but we don't see it more than a quarter, maybe a little bit more of impact. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel. \nPatrick Ho: Bob, on the prepared remarks, you talked about the different variables in terms of the supply chain shrink and the suppliers, your own manufacturing efficiencies as well as the customers. Can you for both September and December give kind of a qualitative commentary on which were the biggest impacts in both September and December? \nRobert Eulau: Yes. I think what I said earlier is we're actually expecting December to be a little more challenging than what we saw in September and the September quarter was not easy. And starting with our own teams, I think we did a really good job given what was going on with COVID in Southeast Asia. We did mention our COVID costs were up to $56 million this quarter. And we've done a really excellent job in terms of working with local governments to try and get as many employees vaccinated as possible and to really do the best we can to assure supply in terms of our own factories.\n Now as we mentioned, like everyone else, we have challenges in terms of getting components as well, particularly, obviously, the controllers on both the hard drive and the flash side, and that has an impact on the business. I don't know quarter-to-quarter, which quarter is worse, but it's a challenge in both of them. And it's a challenge that's not going to go away soon in terms of the semiconductor availability. I mean we're getting some lead times of 50 weeks right now. So it's definitely a very real issue in terms of getting components in.\n And then we've already talked a fair amount about the customer challenges. And I would say it feels to me and Dave can comment like there are more customers impacted by the supply chain in the December quarter than there were in the September quarter. It seems a little more broad-based. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I don't think there's any doubt about that. I think when we talk to our sales teams and we talk to our customers, I mean it's -- I think just over the last month or so, the number of places where we're hearing, they are not able to meet their own true demand or they can't pull the demand from us if they're building their own infrastructure because the supply chain components has definitely broadened. And it's -- I think it started in some of the PC makers. I think that's where we heard the most about it, if you go back a couple of quarters. And now, like I said, we're hearing more about it in other segments, including the big data center providers. So it's definitely an impact of the business, and we just navigate through it.\n I mean, I think when you talk to our customers and we talk to our own sales teams and we look at what everybody is telling us, the end demand continues to be very, very strong. And everybody is just trying to figure out how to meet that and how to get enough components and get the right components to build the right kit, whether it's for something they're going to sell or it's building their own infrastructure to build what they need. And as Bob said, we see that ourselves. And our ability to get components and our ability to make sure our factories continue to run. And I will say I'll be a little bit selfish here and complement our own teams. But the Delta variant in Asia was a very big impact. And this quarter was probably one of the most difficult since COVID started. There were points where we had thousands of employees in quarantine and still kept everything going. So when you see what's happening on the ground and what the impact has been, it's not hard to understand how all the discussions around supply chain impacts.\n I think the good news is that we're working very, very hard, as Bob said, with governments to get vaccines distributed and get things back on track. And as we exit the quarter, and we sit here today, things were in a much, much better shape than they were a couple of months ago. So it makes us optimistic as we go through 2022 that this will get worked out and that will all be able to meet the true demand that's out there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: So on your client business, you guys talked about the PC market being weak in September due to supply disruptions at customers. We all know about the match set challenges on component shortages, that's been pretty well telegraphed. But you also mentioned the WD sort of specific supply chain disruptions on client HDD as well. Is the primary impact the shortage of HDD controllers and preamps or is the primary impact on the COVID-19 related sort of operations disruptions? And given your semiconductor suppliers' lead times, when do you expect to see your client HDD specific chip supply issues start to ease? \nDavid Goeckeler: I'll take a crack and then Bob can add some color as well. I mean it depends on how you look at it. I mean, certainly, our COVID costs are up significantly this quarter. I think nearly 50% or more, 60% on what they were last quarter. We had been steady state for probably 3, 4 quarters in a row, and now we've bumped up significantly. So a lot of that is cost going into managing our own infrastructure and work that's going on with our own teams. Of course, a lot of it is logistics as well. That's always a big component of it. So those costs are going up.\n Our own supply is mainly around controllers. I think it's fair to say. And as Bob said, we're planning a year out on lead times and working with our own suppliers on how we, number one, make sure we get everything we need to meet our demand, which has been challenging and then get it in a time frame that we need. But we're working through it. And like I said, I think that there's no doubt, if you go back a couple of quarters, we've been talking about this about how we were not able to meet all the demand that we saw out there. I think the thing that we see different walking into this quarter is there's -- we're seeing even a greater impact across all of our customer base, and it's spreading to places where we hadn't seen it before. And that's both raising the uncertainty and also just depressing the demand because customers can't get all the pieces they need, so they don't need everything from us.\n So we're starting to see some hints in some markets, starting to clear up a little bit, super early days. But again, if you look at what's going on in the ground in Asia, things are getting better, at least from our perspective, our narrow perspective, although we have 40,000, 50,000 people there. Things are getting better on the ground and that gives us optimism that the situation will improve from here as we go through '22. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. \nThomas O'Malley: I had another one on the HDD business. You guys have done a really good job of improving profitability over the last year plus. My question is, as related to supply issues, clearly, there's a revenue headwind here. Could you talk about the impact to gross margins? Do you expect that you see a greater impact there because of the supply issues? Or is this more of a revenue issue with gross margins kind of hanging in? Any help there would be nice. \nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Let me start and then turn it over to Bob. I mean I think there are some headwinds. I mean one of them would be a little bit of mix because at least for a 1 quarter impact because we've got such a big customer pushing out some demand. And then you've got pricing going up on components. So you've got inflation in the supply chain is a bit of a headwind as well.\n All that said, we appreciate your comments. The team has worked extremely hard. We've rolled out a lot of innovation in the drive business and driven the gross margins. 30.9% this quarter, we thought was a great result. And on top of that, we had couple of points of COVID headwind on top of it. So it all starts with making sure we deliver a great product to our customers. It starts with innovation. You guys have heard me say this many, many times, and I think the innovation engine is alive and well.\n Another big step forward this quarter with OptiNAND. And I think as the team continues to drive innovation and we drive great products to our customers, we'll have the opportunity to continue to have a better conversation with our customers around profitability. All that said, there are some headwinds, I would say, in the near term. \nRobert Eulau: Yes, there are definitely headwinds. But like you said, the team has done a great job in terms of the product portfolio, and we think the gross margins will be down a little. We are going to have probably COVID costs in the same ballpark as we have this quarter. So that's a couple of points. But I think we've got a really good chance of having gross margins above 30%, again, on the hard drive business. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. \nJim Suva: I just have one question, and it sounds like the December outlook is truly in aberration. So the people will push back and say, well, why is it truly an aberration and not simply the new norm. So maybe if you can walk us through around why December is so unique because whether it'd be supply chain or shipping costs, they look quite prolonged. So if you could just kind of lay out the reasons about why December is so unique for such aberration? \nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean, first of all, we're in a very unique time and we're still. I think as we talked about the supply chain disruptions that have been brought by COVID and especially the Delta variant that really pushed through Asia over the last quarter or more have been very, very significant and very severe. And to the people that were managing the situation on the ground there, they did a tremendous job, they had an enormous amount of work just to keep everything running.\n So I think that just leads to a very unique environment, Jim, that we're navigating through. Like I said, when we look at demand and we look at what our customers are telling us about demand in the market, we hear very good things. We -- they're very positive and very bullish. We just have -- you just have different customers in different states of their own ability to build what they need to build or want to build and that's constantly shifting. And when you add it all up in any particular quarter, you're going to get a result and that's what we got, and that's what we'll manage to. But we think that as the supply chain issues get worked out, the demand trends in the business are very, very strong, and we're on the right side of where the world is going from a technology point of view.\n Now I thought it was significant this quarter to 44%, record percent of our quarter was in the cloud. And hopefully, you guys react positively to our simpler decomposition of our revenue across cloud, client and consumer, but we expect to see more growth in cloud, 72% year-over-year growth in that part of the business, and we continue to have the portfolio pivoting in that direction and expect it to be -- expect to participate in that growth as it goes forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. \nSteven Fox: So I guess I'm just trying to understand the idea that none of the demand pushouts are perishable because this is the seasonally strongest quarter of the year. How do we have confidence around that maybe not necessarily that it's perishable, but maybe spending that would have occurred in December, it doesn't occur in March, even if there's availability just because of timing around -- usual timing around spending? \nDavid Goeckeler: Well, again, I think it goes back to -- if you're talking to a very large cloud provider that's trying to build out their infrastructure, I think they're going to catch up on building it out to what their demand is. If they can't do it this quarter, they'll get the components in the next quarter. So again, we see very good demand environment. And I think that as our customers are able to get all the components they need, they will continue to come back to us and adjust their demand to us. That's what we see. We have very close relationships with them. And so I don't expect that the demand from our customers' point of view is not like kind of a 1-quarter thing. It's like -- it's just -- it's a demand curve that goes on, and I don't see it as being perishable demand. I see it as everybody is trying to figure out how they can get as many components as they can to build complete kits for what they need to do. And as they do that, they come back to us and change their demand signal. And we've seen that.\n Maybe a good example is on some of the PC manufacturers, where 1 quarter, they'll drop their demand significantly. In the next quarter, they'll come back and raise it significantly when they've got their own supply chain issues worked out. So as I said, we've seen this in other parts of the market, and we've dealt with it, and we know how to deal with it. Now we're just seeing it across -- the broader cross-section of our business. And quite frankly, some really big customers across that are in that mix now. And we'll -- we've been working through this now for the last several quarters, and we'll work through it this quarter. \nRobert Eulau: Yes. And the most seasonal business is the consumer business, and we are expecting to have a sequential increase in the consumer business. So I think that's probably where it might be perishable demand. But we think that will be pretty solid this quarter. \nOperator: And today's final question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. \nSrinivas Pajjuri: Dave, I had a question about your pricing strategy going forward, especially given the cost inflation we are seeing in the supply chain. I guess some of the cost increases are temporary and some may be permanent. I'm just curious as to hear your thoughts in your conversations with your customers, what kind of feedback you're getting as you kind of look to pass through some of these costs to your customers? And also I want to hear about your -- what you think your ability is in terms of passing through some of these incremental costs if these costs continue to, I guess, remain permanent? \nDavid Goeckeler: I think you hit on the answer in your first part of your question set up, which is these are broad and long relationships with our customers, and they don't go up and down quite so fast. So we certainly have conversations with our customers when our costs increase, but it's not as simple as just passing it along. It's got to persist for a while before we would have that conversation. And quite frankly, we participate in a market. It's -- and so it's more about the market price. I think the overwhelming issue with pricing is around innovation, and making sure we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio.\n And as I look back on last quarter, the 2 things that -- 2 really big things that stand out to me from last quarter is, one, is just the execution of the team in a really, really difficult environment, especially the -- as I've talked a lot about the factories in Asia; and two is the innovation road map and the fact we're transitioning aggressively to BiCS5. We introduced OptiNAND. Those are the things. We introduced a 20-terabyte drive and are going to be shipping that in volume now here in the next month. That's with our energy assist technology 9-platter, 9 disk drive, 2.2 terabytes per platter. So that's the primary issue where it's going to drive an innovation-led discussion with our customers about pricing.\n In the cost side of it, of course, as if they're going to be very long term, we're going to have those conversations. But I would say they're long and substantial relationships, and we manage through the quarter-to-quarter stuff with them really in both directions. But really, the focus is on that -- on driving innovation. If you drive innovation, you're going to get a better return for it. And quite frankly, I think we've seen that over the last 3 or 4 quarters as we brought energy assist in our 18-terabyte drive, the 30.9% gross margin this quarter in HDD is a multiyear high. So we feel very good about that. \nOperator: And speakers, that was our final question. I'll turn it over to you for any closing remarks. \nDavid Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We really appreciate it. It's always good to talk to everyone. Thank you for all your questions, and we look forward to talking to all of you throughout the quarter. Take care. \nRobert Eulau: Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 results. We reported revenue of $5.1 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49, all within the guidance ranges we provided in August. This marks the sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding guidance, a point that we are particularly proud of as we continue to navigate uncertainty and volatility in the market.\n Strong demand across diverse end markets, particularly for our cloud products, combined with Western Digital's strong innovation, broad routes to market and sharpened execution enabled us to deliver results within our guidance range despite significant COVID impacts and supply chain disruptions. While these disruptions are transitory, the long-term opportunities for Western Digital remain unchanged as the world's digital transformation continues to accelerate.\n During the quarter, we shipped a record level of exabytes, while also improving non-GAAP gross margins across both flash and HDD and generating profitable growth. We saw strong demand for our latest generation hard drives and flash products in the cloud end market as well as strong consumer demand for new 5G-based mobile phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 flash solutions. The strong demand for these products were partially offset by pressure in the commercial channel within the client end market and certain portions of the consumer end market, particularly retail. This was attributable to component issues impacting our customers' ability to ship products, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.\n Our continued focus on innovation and a more agile business unit structure enabled us to quickly adapt to these dynamics. When combined with an industry-leading portfolio and a strong go-to-market operation, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to continue to generate improved operational performance for all of our stakeholders. Before I get into the business trends, I want to highlight a few changes we made to our end market breakdown, which, we believe, will help you understand why Western Digital is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the increasing value and importance of data.\n We now split our end markets into cloud, client and consumer. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital, and we are uniquely positioned to address customer storage needs as the only provider of both hard drive and flash products. During the first quarter, cloud represented a record 44% of total revenue, led by record capacity enterprise hard drive revenue and nearly 30% sequential growth in enterprise SSD revenue.\n We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive growth in this end market and continue to shift our business mix towards the cloud. As we ramp our new innovative products and continue leveraging the benefits of the organization structure we put into place last September, I am confident we will capture opportunities to achieve a more stable and profitable growth profile over the long term.\n The client end market represented 37% of revenue in the first quarter. Here, we are providing a broad array of high-performance flash and hard drive solutions to our OEM and channel customers across PC, mobile, gaming, automotive, VR headsets, at-home entertainment devices and industrial spaces.\n Lastly, the consumer end market accounted for 19% of revenue in the first quarter. The highlight of this end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and the WD_BLACK brand of storage products for gaming enthusiasts, which is strong and growing. The brand recognition and infinity, combined with our unmatched reach with nearly 400,000 points of presence across the world is a great setup for Western Digital as we enter a seasonally stronger part of the year.\n With that, I'll now provide a recap of our HDD and flash businesses as it relates to our first quarter results. In HDD, continued strong demand for our latest generation energy-assisted drives among our cloud and enterprise customers drove record revenue and exabyte shipments in our cloud end market. In addition, we experienced strong revenue growth in our smart video product line, and we're unable to meet demand.\n During the quarter, we announced OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the HDD control plane to further increase aerial density. With this leading architecture, we achieved 20-terabyte capacity using our field-proven 9-disk mechanical platform and ePMR technology. Next month will commence volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technology. In flash, revenue grew in the quarter due to continued strong demand within the cloud and client end markets for our latest generation of our enterprise SSD products and the ramp of new 5G phones incorporating our latest BiCS5 node.\n Within enterprise SSD, we experienced continued success in the cloud with another successful quarter of qualifications. We are now qualified at 3 cloud titans and have made excellent progress working our way through the qualification process in the enterprise and distribution channels. We expect these qualifications to start to drive accelerated revenue growth in 2022 as our customers begin to deploy these products into their networks.\n The ramp of next-generation 5G phones incorporating our latest generation of BiCS5 products accelerated in the quarter, with revenue growing over 20% sequentially. We expect this migration to 5G, combined with a continued increase in the amount of storage per phone to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter. Gaming was strong in the quarter with a solid lineup of products for game consoles along with a growing brand recognition of WD_BLACK based products in the channel and retail.\n Heading into the second fiscal quarter, we are well positioned to take advantage of seasonal strength and grow in a wide variety of gaming channels. As I noted earlier, the client PC OEMs' distribution channel and retail were impacted by our customers' ability to ship product, greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns. Demand was solid, but these transitory issues impacted our ability to realize this demand in our results.\n In total, bit growth accelerated to 30% year-over-year in the first quarter as we ramp BiCS5 to 17% of flash revenue. This quarter, we expect year-over-year bit growth to further accelerate to the mid-30s range with BiCS5 bit crossover to happen later in the quarter.\n Our long-term goal is to grow bits in line with the market, taking advantage of our product and end market breadth to shift our bits to optimize profitability. As we look into calendar year 2022, we are optimistic as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. We have industry-leading technology, the right product portfolio and investments and the organizational agility to fundamentally drive improved profitability regardless of market condition.\n We have a great position in 2 large and growing markets in flash and HDD, and we have proven our ability to drive innovation throughout our portfolio and deliver industry-leading products to a broad and loyal customer base. We believe that the migration to the cloud and demand for storage solutions throughout the client and consumer markets will drive a huge opportunity for Western Digital and our customers.\n I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results. Thanks, Bob. I want to conclude by thanking the Western Digital team for their hard work and commitment to our customers throughout a challenging quarter. Despite the transitory issues we have been able to successfully navigate, it is clearer than ever Western Digital's innovative technology portfolio is foundational to the rapid digital transformation and transition to the cloud that the world is experiencing. With our deep roots in a broad range of end markets and a sharp focus on execution, I'm confident in Western Digital's ability to capture this massive opportunity, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the fiscal year.\n Let's now begin the Q&A. Hey, Aaron? Aaron, this is Dave. First of all, thanks for the question. I guess the one thing I would say as well is, whereas maybe a quarter or 2 ago, we were seeing it in maybe certain parts of the business, some of the OEMs, PC OEMs. Now we're seeing it more broadly, even the big data center players are having their demand impact. Our demand from them is being impacted by their ability to get other components. So it's really become a much more broad-based issue across the portfolio. Yes, I guess, Aaron, Bob right on the money on that. I guess the only thing I would add is a little bit of softness in some of the transactional and consumer markets, but that we're already seeing that level out a little bit. And we're really seeing this bifurcation where the qualified bits in the market are strong and unqualified are a little bit weaker. I guess that's not surprising given all the nodal transitions the industry is going through. But the primary issue, I would say that's the issue in mix, as Bob pointed out. And we expected that walking into the quarter. Yes. I think that's probably a little -- we don't guide each individual business, but I think your number is probably a little heavy. You hit on some of the issues. Some of it is mix. We've actually got one of our very, very big customers that has their own supply chain issues that's pushing out some orders. So that's a bit of an idiosyncratic thing that's happening there. There's some supply chain issues with, especially in kind of mid-cap and the ability to build all of that supply we want. We talked about that even in this past quarter in the smart video market, which is strong and there's some unmet demand there.\n And then we've got -- we're seeing a little bit of an inventory issue, quite frankly, in China, where there's a lot of high-cap inventory there, and that's kind of pulling the number down a little bit for the next quarter. But we -- so we expect all those things are transitory issues. We're really happy about the portfolio. I think the fact that AT&T was now -- the majority of the portfolio, we talked about shipping 20-t on a 9-disk platform and OptiNAND is out there and in customers' hands. So we feel really good about the innovation that was delivered in the quarter and about where the road map is going in the drive business and the new technology has been very well received. Yes, I think that's right. I mean it's early in the node. We are happy with the ramp this quarter. We ended at, I think, 17% BiCS5, and we expect to get crossover before we exit the year. But like any new node, you're in more of the mobile components market as the rest of the products get qualified, but that's all work underway. And our customers are definitely pulling us in that direction. They want BiCS5 on the SSD products and the engineers are hard at work at getting that work done. That will be an evolving story as we work through '22. I don't think we see it as a Chi effect. I mean, I was just talking to our sales team this morning, and I think the channel has now kind of normalized and back on seasonality after the Chi disruption. I think we just see this issue with people not able to get all the components they need to put together the full kit for what they want to ship, and that's causing some softness in the channel. So I think it's more related to that than it is anything Chi related, at least in my view. I can start. Yes. So I think as a general statement, we're seeing continued very strong demand from our data center customers, especially we've very big data center customers. They're giving us good signals about next year and what they plan to do. It's hard to pin that down to a certain quarter right now, but we continue to see very strong demand there. Like I said, we're starting to see the supply chain impact show up there as well. But I'm sure that will all get worked through as we go through the year. But we look into '22, and we have our customers telling us, it continues to be a strong demand environment. Well, I mean I think I'll speak in general about Kioxia. They're a tremendous JV partner. And we've spoken a lot about the JV and what the benefits of that are. And all the -- I think one of the highlights of the quarter is the continued production of the flash road map and BiCS5 and the cost situation that, that's driving. I mean I think it's always been a very big focus of the Western Digital and Kioxia team to very focus on capital efficiency and cost downs in the portfolio. Those -- the seeds for BiCS5 performance that we're seeing now were shown many years ago. That continues to be a great focus of the joint teams. And I think the fact that we have a joint road map with another supplier as big as Kioxia gives us a lot of investment in our road map.\n And then, of course, we produce together as well and have a lot of synergies there as well. So it's a great partnership. We -- it's been going for over 20 years now. It's going to go for -- we're signed up for at least another decade. And we always look at that as we continue to invest in fabs, and we're really happy with the partnership, and we're going to continue to get the best out of it. Yes. I think we're certainly having those discussions with them. I mean, I think every quarter, we discussed the current quarter and out many quarters -- several quarters in advance at least, I mean, we don't lock in per se on those numbers exactly, but we think about share of their particular businesses and what that's going to look like and what that means to demand for us. So yes, we're having those conversations, and we're factoring them into the mix of bits for next year and how we allocate across the portfolio. Of course, there's a nodal mix equation of that as well as it's kind of referred to in the previous question, when are different products available on different nodes out of the fab. So we're working through all that right now. Toshi Hari, so first of all, yes, we are really happy with the progress of the portfolio. I remember sitting here a year ago, and we were just trying to get over the hump on the first one, and now we're over 3 of them, and we continue to work at the OEMs, which the enterprise OEMs, which tend to be longer call cycles, and we're making good progress there as well. And you're right. We'll -- we got the calls done. We'll start to see some -- a little bit of deployment next quarter and then start to ramp it throughout '22. So I think it's an evolving story as we go throughout the year. From what is -- I think it's a very attractive TAM. I think with good margins, and that's why we're investing in the products. And I think as we mix more into that and have more supply into that, it's a tailwind for the overall portfolio. That's definitely a true statement. Yes. We think the PC TAM is good next year. I mean we're obviously coming off of a blockbuster year with COVID. I mean we see the pre-COVID baseline is around 265 million, 270 million units. That went up to 340 million this year expected around that number, and we see somewhere around 320 million to 335 million next year. So definitely been -- we're going to come off this year a little bit. But we're -- we see basically the baseline has been reset, pre-COVID by a significant amount. So we feel good about that. We're hearing that from our customers. We're talking to those customers now about 2022 plans and what they plan to do and how much supply they're going to need and share conversations with each of them and those conversations are going well.\n The smartphone market, again, we continue to see this past quarter and the quarter in, we're seeing really good strength in that market. So I think this is -- there's a larger point here about the flash market is that the number of end markets is just more diverse now, especially with enterprise SSD growing and getting to be such a big market that there's a much better mix of demand that we play across in the market. And so we see strength in PC. We see strength in smartphones. We see strength in data center.\n Like we said, the more transactional markets this past quarter is more nodal transitions going on. There was more bits available in those markets, and we definitely saw that. But again, we're heading into a seasonally strong quarter on retail. So as we go through the quarter, we'll get a very strong idea about how retail is going to play out as well as we go through the holiday season. That's the main geography we're watching, and it's mainly high capacity, and we think it will get worked through in the next quarter. But it's definitely in the channel and it's some of the big customers. So it's just something that's going to impact the amount of business that goes -- that flows through that part of the market, which is a pretty big market for all of us, but we don't see it more than a quarter, maybe a little bit more of impact. Yes, I don't think there's any doubt about that. I think when we talk to our sales teams and we talk to our customers, I mean it's -- I think just over the last month or so, the number of places where we're hearing, they are not able to meet their own true demand or they can't pull the demand from us if they're building their own infrastructure because the supply chain components has definitely broadened. And it's -- I think it started in some of the PC makers. I think that's where we heard the most about it, if you go back a couple of quarters. And now, like I said, we're hearing more about it in other segments, including the big data center providers. So it's definitely an impact of the business, and we just navigate through it.\n I mean, I think when you talk to our customers and we talk to our own sales teams and we look at what everybody is telling us, the end demand continues to be very, very strong. And everybody is just trying to figure out how to meet that and how to get enough components and get the right components to build the right kit, whether it's for something they're going to sell or it's building their own infrastructure to build what they need. And as Bob said, we see that ourselves. And our ability to get components and our ability to make sure our factories continue to run. And I will say I'll be a little bit selfish here and complement our own teams. But the Delta variant in Asia was a very big impact. And this quarter was probably one of the most difficult since COVID started. There were points where we had thousands of employees in quarantine and still kept everything going. So when you see what's happening on the ground and what the impact has been, it's not hard to understand how all the discussions around supply chain impacts.\n I think the good news is that we're working very, very hard, as Bob said, with governments to get vaccines distributed and get things back on track. And as we exit the quarter, and we sit here today, things were in a much, much better shape than they were a couple of months ago. So it makes us optimistic as we go through 2022 that this will get worked out and that will all be able to meet the true demand that's out there. I'll take a crack and then Bob can add some color as well. I mean it depends on how you look at it. I mean, certainly, our COVID costs are up significantly this quarter. I think nearly 50% or more, 60% on what they were last quarter. We had been steady state for probably 3, 4 quarters in a row, and now we've bumped up significantly. So a lot of that is cost going into managing our own infrastructure and work that's going on with our own teams. Of course, a lot of it is logistics as well. That's always a big component of it. So those costs are going up.\n Our own supply is mainly around controllers. I think it's fair to say. And as Bob said, we're planning a year out on lead times and working with our own suppliers on how we, number one, make sure we get everything we need to meet our demand, which has been challenging and then get it in a time frame that we need. But we're working through it. And like I said, I think that there's no doubt, if you go back a couple of quarters, we've been talking about this about how we were not able to meet all the demand that we saw out there. I think the thing that we see different walking into this quarter is there's -- we're seeing even a greater impact across all of our customer base, and it's spreading to places where we hadn't seen it before. And that's both raising the uncertainty and also just depressing the demand because customers can't get all the pieces they need, so they don't need everything from us.\n So we're starting to see some hints in some markets, starting to clear up a little bit, super early days. But again, if you look at what's going on in the ground in Asia, things are getting better, at least from our perspective, our narrow perspective, although we have 40,000, 50,000 people there. Things are getting better on the ground and that gives us optimism that the situation will improve from here as we go through '22. Yes. Let me start and then turn it over to Bob. I mean I think there are some headwinds. I mean one of them would be a little bit of mix because at least for a 1 quarter impact because we've got such a big customer pushing out some demand. And then you've got pricing going up on components. So you've got inflation in the supply chain is a bit of a headwind as well.\n All that said, we appreciate your comments. The team has worked extremely hard. We've rolled out a lot of innovation in the drive business and driven the gross margins. 30.9% this quarter, we thought was a great result. And on top of that, we had couple of points of COVID headwind on top of it. So it all starts with making sure we deliver a great product to our customers. It starts with innovation. You guys have heard me say this many, many times, and I think the innovation engine is alive and well.\n Another big step forward this quarter with OptiNAND. And I think as the team continues to drive innovation and we drive great products to our customers, we'll have the opportunity to continue to have a better conversation with our customers around profitability. All that said, there are some headwinds, I would say, in the near term. Well, I mean, first of all, we're in a very unique time and we're still. I think as we talked about the supply chain disruptions that have been brought by COVID and especially the Delta variant that really pushed through Asia over the last quarter or more have been very, very significant and very severe. And to the people that were managing the situation on the ground there, they did a tremendous job, they had an enormous amount of work just to keep everything running.\n So I think that just leads to a very unique environment, Jim, that we're navigating through. Like I said, when we look at demand and we look at what our customers are telling us about demand in the market, we hear very good things. We -- they're very positive and very bullish. We just have -- you just have different customers in different states of their own ability to build what they need to build or want to build and that's constantly shifting. And when you add it all up in any particular quarter, you're going to get a result and that's what we got, and that's what we'll manage to. But we think that as the supply chain issues get worked out, the demand trends in the business are very, very strong, and we're on the right side of where the world is going from a technology point of view.\n Now I thought it was significant this quarter to 44%, record percent of our quarter was in the cloud. And hopefully, you guys react positively to our simpler decomposition of our revenue across cloud, client and consumer, but we expect to see more growth in cloud, 72% year-over-year growth in that part of the business, and we continue to have the portfolio pivoting in that direction and expect it to be -- expect to participate in that growth as it goes forward. Well, again, I think it goes back to -- if you're talking to a very large cloud provider that's trying to build out their infrastructure, I think they're going to catch up on building it out to what their demand is. If they can't do it this quarter, they'll get the components in the next quarter. So again, we see very good demand environment. And I think that as our customers are able to get all the components they need, they will continue to come back to us and adjust their demand to us. That's what we see. We have very close relationships with them. And so I don't expect that the demand from our customers' point of view is not like kind of a 1-quarter thing. It's like -- it's just -- it's a demand curve that goes on, and I don't see it as being perishable demand. I see it as everybody is trying to figure out how they can get as many components as they can to build complete kits for what they need to do. And as they do that, they come back to us and change their demand signal. And we've seen that.\n Maybe a good example is on some of the PC manufacturers, where 1 quarter, they'll drop their demand significantly. In the next quarter, they'll come back and raise it significantly when they've got their own supply chain issues worked out. So as I said, we've seen this in other parts of the market, and we've dealt with it, and we know how to deal with it. Now we're just seeing it across -- the broader cross-section of our business. And quite frankly, some really big customers across that are in that mix now. And we'll -- we've been working through this now for the last several quarters, and we'll work through it this quarter. I think you hit on the answer in your first part of your question set up, which is these are broad and long relationships with our customers, and they don't go up and down quite so fast. So we certainly have conversations with our customers when our costs increase, but it's not as simple as just passing it along. It's got to persist for a while before we would have that conversation. And quite frankly, we participate in a market. It's -- and so it's more about the market price. I think the overwhelming issue with pricing is around innovation, and making sure we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio.\n And as I look back on last quarter, the 2 things that -- 2 really big things that stand out to me from last quarter is, one, is just the execution of the team in a really, really difficult environment, especially the -- as I've talked a lot about the factories in Asia; and two is the innovation road map and the fact we're transitioning aggressively to BiCS5. We introduced OptiNAND. Those are the things. We introduced a 20-terabyte drive and are going to be shipping that in volume now here in the next month. That's with our energy assist technology 9-platter, 9 disk drive, 2.2 terabytes per platter. So that's the primary issue where it's going to drive an innovation-led discussion with our customers about pricing.\n In the cost side of it, of course, as if they're going to be very long term, we're going to have those conversations. But I would say they're long and substantial relationships, and we manage through the quarter-to-quarter stuff with them really in both directions. But really, the focus is on that -- on driving innovation. If you drive innovation, you're going to get a better return for it. And quite frankly, I think we've seen that over the last 3 or 4 quarters as we brought energy assist in our 18-terabyte drive, the 30.9% gross margin this quarter in HDD is a multiyear high. So we feel very good about that. All right, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We really appreciate it. It's always good to talk to everyone. Thank you for all your questions, and we look forward to talking to all of you throughout the quarter. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal first quarter were within the guidance ranges provided in August, marking the sixth quarter in a row that we've met or exceeded guidance.\n Total revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.49. Please note that EPS included $56 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I'll provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to deliver such good results in the face of this unanticipated headwind and other supply chain issues.\n From a disclosure perspective, in addition to the change in our end market breakdown that Dave discussed, this quarter, we moved to segment reporting for our flash and hard drive businesses. For more details, please refer to our earnings deck.\n Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 44% of revenue at $2.2 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 72% from a year ago. This represented the second quarter in a row of record revenue. What is encouraging about this cloud revenue growth is the strength and breadth of our revenue streams across product areas. There was growth on a sequential basis in both the flash and hard drive business units as well as across every product category within the cloud, including capacity enterprise drives, enterprise SSDs, smart video and platforms. As the cloud continues to grow as a percentage of our revenue, we see an opportunity to reduce volatility in revenue and profitability. Over the last 3 quarters, we have successfully ramped our 18-terabyte energy-assisted drive to our highest volume mainstream product within the cloud end market.\n Overall, cloud HDD exabyte shipments grew 9% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year and comprised over 80% of total HDD exabyte shipments. Client represented 37% of revenue at $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. A highlight within the client end market was growth within our flash business unit, specifically in mobile, gaming, automotive, IoT and industrial applications. Our strength here was more than offset by pressure in desktop and notebook hard drives due to supply disruptions at our customers and within our own operations.\n Finally, consumer represented 19% of revenue at $973 million, down 6% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Both our flash and hard drive business units declined on a sequential basis due to similar supply disruptions in addition to uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.\n Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially, primarily due to mix and pricing within our transactional markets. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were flat. Flash bit shipments increased 8% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Hard drive revenue was $2.6 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 4%, while the average price per hard drive increased 5% to $102.\n As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 33.9%, up 1 percentage point sequentially. As noted earlier, this included $56 million in COVID-related costs or a 1.1 percentage point impact. These were highest COVID-related costs in over a year.\n Our broad routes to market and ability to proactively shift bits to the most attractive end markets enabled us to expand our flash gross margin by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 37%. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.9%, up 60 basis points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $51 million or approximately 2 percentage points.\n Operating expenses were $761 million, within our guidance range. Operating income was $952 million, representing a 15% increase from the prior quarter and tripling year-over-year, highlighting our profitable growth. With our improving profitability, our tax rate in the fiscal first quarter was 11%.\n Earnings per share was $2.49, toward the top of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $521 million, and free cash flow was $224 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was a cash outflow of $297 million. We continue to expect gross CapEx for this fiscal year to be approximately $3 billion and cash CapEx to be around $2 billion.\n In the fiscal first quarter, we paid off $213 million in debt, including a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $8.6 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, as a result of our strong financial results and free cash flow generation, last week, we repaid the remaining balance of our term Loan B in the amount of $943 million, bringing total gross debt outstanding to $7.7 billion.\n Our adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.2 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.0x, down from 2.7 a year ago and was the lowest in 3 years. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\n Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion and we expect flash revenue to increase sequentially and hard drive revenue to decline sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the second quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.95 and $2.25 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 316 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Dave. No problem. We hear you. Yes, it's difficult to quantify, right, because there's impact in terms of our own execution, which, I think, we worked our way through pretty well during the quarter. And then we have customers who have supply chain challenges as well where they're trying to get match sets and build out their environments. And then, of course, we have supplier challenges as well, where we're working like everybody else, pretty hard to get components in. So it's difficult to give you a definitive answer in terms of what the impact was in the quarter, we just closed or even obviously, in the next quarter. But it's certainly somewhere in the couple of hundred million dollar range and potentially a little worse in the December quarter. Yes, I can start, and then Dave can fill in. Yes, I mean, the blended ASP, as we started the quarter, we indicated we expected it to be down. And it was based on the mix we were anticipating. The mix came in essentially the way we had expected. And it was -- I don't want to get into every little detail of the mix. But one of the things we said at the beginning of the quarter was we expected more mobile volume in the September quarter, and that is what we saw. We actually think we'll see even more mobile as a percentage of the total in the December quarter. So mix is definitely a bit of a headwind for us. But really, ASPs are not going down that much. And we're really pleased with the cost reductions we've been able to achieve both in the quarter we just finished as well as what we're expecting to do this quarter. Yes, C.J., you're right. It's difficult to say exactly what's going to happen over the next few quarters. But -- and as you know, we only give guidance 1 quarter at a time. Now having said that, we're pretty optimistic on 2022. Again, we think a lot of the challenges in the quarter we closed, in the quarter we're in now are really supply chain related. We think the underlying demand situation is very positive. We really believe, as I said in our cost reduction plans, and we think we'll be able to deliver solid margins. So I don't want to get into giving guidance for next year, but we're definitely optimistic. Do you want me to take that or you? Okay. Yes. I don't think I have anything to add. I mean we believe in the cloud demand. I think it's strong, and there just is a lot of supply chain dislocation right now. Yes. I mean we do have good visibility, and you saw our bit growth came back up again this quarter. We expect it to be a bit higher year-over-year next quarter. Our long-term goal continues to be to grow at the rate the market is growing, and we won't get that perfectly every quarter, but that's our objective. And we think that, again, with Kioxia, we've got the right plans in place for next year. Yes. I don't think we put a specific number out there yet. Some of the industry analysts suggesting industry demand growth in the low 30% range. Yes. I mean, again, it's hard to quantify exactly what the supply chain impacts were, and we're actually not giving guidance by segment, but we definitely believe the hard drive business is a growth business and it will continue to grow over the next few quarters. We think 2022 will be a strong year. And yes, this is a bit of an aberration in the December quarter, but it's -- the business is really solid. The underlying demand is very good. And you're right. I mean we already commented that there are some supply chain issues that are impacting us right now. Yes. I mean this is -- I'm trying to think how to answer this question differently. I mean we're actually not giving guidance by segment. However, we did say we expect revenue to be down a bit on the hard drive side. We expect it to be up sequentially on the flash side. There are supply chain challenges in -- with some cloud customers. There are supply chain challenges with some PC OEMs. We also mentioned that there seems to be a fair amount of inventory in China right now. So there's -- there definitely are some short-term challenges with respect to the hard drive business. But again, long term, the underlying growth is really good there. Yes. I think what I said earlier is we're actually expecting December to be a little more challenging than what we saw in September and the September quarter was not easy. And starting with our own teams, I think we did a really good job given what was going on with COVID in Southeast Asia. We did mention our COVID costs were up to $56 million this quarter. And we've done a really excellent job in terms of working with local governments to try and get as many employees vaccinated as possible and to really do the best we can to assure supply in terms of our own factories.\n Now as we mentioned, like everyone else, we have challenges in terms of getting components as well, particularly, obviously, the controllers on both the hard drive and the flash side, and that has an impact on the business. I don't know quarter-to-quarter, which quarter is worse, but it's a challenge in both of them. And it's a challenge that's not going to go away soon in terms of the semiconductor availability. I mean we're getting some lead times of 50 weeks right now. So it's definitely a very real issue in terms of getting components in.\n And then we've already talked a fair amount about the customer challenges. And I would say it feels to me and Dave can comment like there are more customers impacted by the supply chain in the December quarter than there were in the September quarter. It seems a little more broad-based. Yes, there are definitely headwinds. But like you said, the team has done a great job in terms of the product portfolio, and we think the gross margins will be down a little. We are going to have probably COVID costs in the same ballpark as we have this quarter. So that's a couple of points. But I think we've got a really good chance of having gross margins above 30%, again, on the hard drive business. Yes. And the most seasonal business is the consumer business, and we are expecting to have a sequential increase in the consumer business. So I think that's probably where it might be perishable demand. But we think that will be pretty solid this quarter. Thanks, everyone."

Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analyst and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, spending and cost reductions, business plans and performance, market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and/or our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. Western Digital's fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded expectations as our access to broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to capture demand upsides in both client and consumer end-markets, reaffirming our strength in a challenging market environment. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.7 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Before diving into the specifics of the quarter and the full fiscal year, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments in fiscal year 2023. Importantly, we continued to optimize our operations and successfully executed our innovative product roadmap, priming ourselves for greater profitability when demand rebounds across hard drives and flash. Throughout the fiscal year, we were focused on enhancing our product leadership and reinforcing our business agility. In HDD, we have successfully qualified our latest family of capacity enterprise hard drives that all major customers and are shipping our 26-terabyte Ultra SMR drive in high volume. In Flash, we pioneered the use of wafer bonding and advanced 3D NAND manufacturing and introduced the groundbreaking technology in BiCS8, which sets the foundation for future 3D NAND scaling. On the expense front, we streamlined investments across our HDD and Flash portfolio, which enabled us to significantly reduce quarterly operating expense, while continuing to deliver innovative products and technologies that address customers\u2019 growing storage needs. Further, we have reduced our cash capital expenditure run rate by over 50% in the fiscal second-half and consolidated our hard drive manufacturing footprint. These efforts enabled Western Digital to preserve capital, while effectively executing on product strategies and aligning our supply with post-pandemic demand environment. Notably, we reduced our inventory by nearly $300 million sequentially and exited fiscal year 2023 at a much healthier level than a few quarters ago. And in June, we successfully completed amendments to our credit agreements, which provide Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility as we navigate macro dynamics. In summary, we continue to proactively take action to bolster our agility, enhance our liquidity position, optimize our inventory levels across HDD and Flash, and strengthened our position as an industry and market leader. We exited fiscal year 2023 well-positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and capture long-term growth opportunities in data storage, spanning from client to edge to cloud. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the strategic review is ongoing. We continue to make progress on this process and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Turning to the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue in both client and consumer end-markets returned to sequential growth led by normalized end-market demand and higher average capacity per unit in Flash. In consumer, retail flash exceeded our expectations across all major product categories. We saw similar results in client with upside in both HDD and Flash and across almost all major product categories, including client SSD, gaming console, embedded flash and client hard drives. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remained subdued. I'll now turn to a business update, starting with HDD. In the fiscal fourth quarter, ongoing cloud weakness drove the overall decline in HDD revenue. However, demand for both client and consumer hard drives has stabilized and exceeded our expectations. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have successfully qualified all variance of our 22 terabyte CMR and 26 terabyte Ultra SMR hard drive platforms at all major cloud customers, setting the stage to improve shipments and profitability. In addition, we are about to begin product sampling of our 28 terabyte Ultra SMR drive. This cutting-edge product is built upon the success of our ePMR and Ultra SMR technologies with features and reliability trusted by our customers worldwide. We are staging this product for quick qualification and ramp as demand improves. Turning to Flash, revenue increased sequentially led by growth in both client and consumer flash bit shipments, which exceeded our expectations with total bit shipments returning to year-over-year growth. The stronger-than-expected bit growth is attributable to normalizing PC and consumer demand, as well as content growth. Average capacity per consumer and client SSD increased over 40% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. Moving to technology developments, we continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 based on a chip, bonded to array architecture. BiCS8 solidifies Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost capital efficiency and I/O performance into the future. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspective on our outlook. In HDD, as we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect overall demand to remain stable. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both improving demand and new product ramps to drive growth in revenue and profitability. In Flash, we are encouraged by several indicators signaling improving market dynamics. Notably, our two largest end markets, client and consumer are returning to growth, inventories are normalizing, content per unit is increasing and price declines have been moderating. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded our expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, down 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Looking at end markets for the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 37% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 18% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to a decrease in capacity enterprise drive shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 59 exabytes, down 26% sequentially, driven by ongoing weakness at cloud customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in both hard drive and flash product shipments. Client represented 39% of total revenue at $1 billion, up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by growth in bit shipments for gaming consoles. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in flash pricing and lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Consumer represented 24% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 19% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher retail SSD shipments. The year-over-year decrease was driven by price declines in flash and lower retail hard drive shipments. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12.3 billion, down 34% from fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 17.2 percentage points to 15.7%, and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 21.8 percentage points to negative 4.8%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $3.59. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2023, cloud revenue decreased 34% year-over-year, primarily due to reduced shipments of capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs. Client revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in flash pricing, as well as lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Lastly, consumer revenue decreased 26% for the year as growth in retail SSD bit shipments was more than offset by broad-based flash price decline and lower consumer hard drive shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, HDD revenue was $1.3 billion, down 13% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 18% and average price per unit decreased 9% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, HDD exabyte shipments decreased 38% and average price per unit decreased 17%. Flash revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 43% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 6% on a blended basis and 9% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 15% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 3.9%, down 6.7 percentage points sequentially and 28.4 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $272 million in costs or 10.2 percentage points for manufacturing underutilization, flash inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 3.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.5 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to lower capacity enterprise volume, as well as higher underutilization-related charges. Underutilization charges were $76 million, or 5.9 percentage points. Flash gross margin was negative 11.9%, down 6.9 percentage points sequentially and 47.8 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges due to the reduced manufacturing volumes were $135 million, and inventory write-downs were $27 million, resulting in 11.8 percentage point reduction. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses of $582 million for the quarter, down $20 million sequentially and $178 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $478 million, driven mainly by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling $272 million. Income tax expense was $57 million for fiscal fourth quarter and $237 million for fiscal year 2023. Despite a consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal fourth quarter loss per share was $1.98, inclusive of $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was an outflow of $68 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $219 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, planning and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement were $151 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal fourth quarter. Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth-quarter as defined in our credit agreement, was $1.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 4.5 times, compared to 2.8 times in the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, the credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation add back associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in the cash-flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we executed an amendment to our credit agreements. These amendments include modifications to the leverage ratio requirements applicable through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which provide additional financial flexibility in the near-term. We also extended the commitment under the delayed-draw term-loan agreement to August 14th, 2023. Please refer to our earnings presentation for details. At the end-of-the quarter, total liquidity was $4.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion, and an unused delayed draw term-loan facility of $600 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal first quarter, I'll discuss our business outlook. For fiscal first quarter, sequentially, we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be relatively stable. In fiscal first quarter, we are continuing to adjust production to better match demand and anticipate underutilization charges to impact both HDD and Flash gross margins along with product mix pressures on Flash ASP. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both HDD and Flash revenue to improve through the remainder of fiscal year 2024, driven by normalizing demand in storage, as well as higher average content per unit in Flash. Gross margin is expected to gradually improve driven by higher HDD volume and lower underutilization charges in both Flash and HDD. We will continue to tightly manage our cost structure and expenses as we navigate the challenging environment. For fiscal year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to decline significantly. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.75 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 2.5% and 4.5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $200 million to $220 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $570 million to $590 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal first quarter and $130 million to $170 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect the loss per share of $1.80 to $2.10, assuming approximately 323 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up. Fiscal year 2023 marked a period of exceptional progress and strategic planning for Western Digital. We diligently optimized our operations and executed our innovative product roadmap, priming ourselves for greater profitability as demand inevitably rebounds across hard drives and flash. As we move forward, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities and deliver continued success. Before opening up for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to recognize Siva Sivaram, our esteemed President of Technology and Strategy. Siva will be leaving Western Digital to pursue a great leadership opportunity in a different technology domain. Siva has made significant contributions to Western Digital and SanDisk over the past 10-years and he is a wonderful friend. We wish him all the best going forward. Peter, let's start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to NAND in the current quarter looks like the underutilization charges are similar. Does that mean your utilization is unchanged? And I guess it seems like you're able to make some inventory progress. Does that mean that you can at some point have a line-of-sight to bring that back up?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. NAND in the current quarter, as we said, we saw a good, I guess good market reaction in consumer and in the client business, both returned to growth on an exabyte basis. They both were sequential grower, so we saw incremental upside there, so we were happy about that. We are still underutilizing the fab. I'll let Wissam talk about that in a little bit more detail. We do plan to underutilize for another couple of quarters, but we feel good about the overall -- the signs in the overall market, price declines are moderating, our inventory is down, bit shipments are up and we expect bit shipments to be up again double-digits next quarter. So not quite where we want to be yet, but the market is stabilizing and we see a lot of good things -- a lot of metrics going in the right direction.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, Joe. And with respect to underutilization, we saw similar type of underutilization charges in fiscal Q4 versus Q3. For the Flash side, and when you look at HDD, we had a bit of more underutilization. But sticking with the Flash, also in our guidance, we've noted similar levels into fiscal Q1. Albeit, if you look at, sort of, the range of $200 million to $220 million, I would say it is split 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And also we're -- if I think of, let's say, the fiscal Q2, I anticipate more or less similar levels of underutilization from where we stand today.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. And if I could ask the follow-up. In terms of the uses of cash in the next few quarters, I know you've got the convert that comes due early next year. I think there's still some issues about a potential tax payment. Can you just update us there and sort of do you need to raise money to pay those out?\nWissam Jabre: So with respect to uses of cash, as you noted, we do have the convert that matures in February \u201824, and we plan to address that this quarter or the next one. We also have the IRS settlement that is coming up and we expect also this payment to be very likely this quarter. But with respect to liquidity, exiting fiscal Q4, we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity. And so if you recall the delayed-draw term loan was put in place in the event we need to address the IRS settlement. So that will be drawn down to take care of the IRS settlement when it happens. And with respect to the convert, I mentioned we'd address it in the coming two quarters.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you very much.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.\nWissam Jabre: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. [Technical Difficulty] Good question, I guess this question [Technical Difficulty] supply perspective, we haven't seen any [Technical Difficulty] realization aggressively as we've seen. So how would you think about the current impact of supply-demand normalization in the next six, nine, 12-months?\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. Hey, C.J., right? C.J., that was very -- it was a little tough to hear you there, but I think we got the gist of the question, which was supply demand normalization. Is that right in Flash?\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Sorry about that. Yes.\nDavid Goeckeler: No, that's right. Okay. So look, I think as I said, there are a number of things we saw in the market. This quarter we saw sequential bit growth overall, we saw clients and consumer returning to exabyte growth on a year-over-year basis, with consumer SSD content up 40%, client SSD up 20%. We saw our inventory down. We think in the client -- in the consumer and client markets, PC markets basically shipping to demand at this point. We expect our -- for the fiscal year, we saw our bits about flat year-over-year. For the calendar year, we see them down low-single-digits. We probably see the industry down a little lower than that. So we're taking the actions to bring supply and demand better into balance, and I think we're seeing that across our markets. Cloud is still -- there's still a couple of quarters ago, there that's a larger story, but in our two biggest markets for Flash, we're seeing that supply-demand balance start to move closer together, put it that way.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you. And my second question. [Technical Difficulty] you announced [Technical Difficulty] I think there was a hope that maybe -- there might be some underlying deposits underneath that thing [Technical Difficulty] How should we be thinking about training and hearing about [Technical Difficulty]\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. I think that was the strategic review and timing, C.J. So as the process is active, we look forward to talking more about it when we reach a conclusion.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you, guys. This is [Michael] (ph) on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask, how are you guys thinking with the recent uptick in AI investment in the data center? How do you think that impacts the mix of Flash relative to HDD capacity being deployed, or maybe how that would impact you going forward? And then kind of related to that, how -- are you guys -- can you guys just give us an update on where you stand with your enterprise SSD qualifications? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I've been thinking a lot about generative AI. It's clearly a big topic these days and obviously, a lot of spend going on to build out the infrastructure in the cloud, which I think, quite frankly, is a great thing. The cloud distribution model of new technology is something that is pretty amazing. That's been built out over the last decade, so we all get access to this technology very rapidly. And when I think about this in the storage domain, clearly, the compute infrastructure is being built out now, but what we're all going to be enabled with there are like incredible tools to automate data creation at many different levels, whether it's text data, video data. Whatever it happens to be, I think that we're essentially going to really accelerate our ability all of us to create information that needs to be stored. So I see this is kind of a catalyst for just a profound increase in the amount of data creation. I think that once those tools get distributed and we all start using them, I think that drives incremental growth across SSDs and hard drives. I mean hard drives are the foundational storage in the cloud. It's going to be that way for a very long-time. So while Gen AI may have some disruptions on the business in the near-term, as the compute infrastructure gets built out, very optimistic that this is a - as I said, I think it's a profound -- it's a catalyst for a profound increase in the rate of data creation. So quite excited about that. We don't know exactly what -- how you model that just yet, except that there is new innovation drives new data creation, which drives the need for storage. So we look forward as these -- as this infrastructure gets built out and rapidly adopted, the impact it's going to have on our business. Now on enterprise SSD, we still have the qualifications. We've recently qualified BiCS5 in some of these places. That market along with nearline HDD or capacity enterprise HDD is depressed right now or subdued. So we're not seeing a lot of growth in that. But we fully expect that when that market comes back and that part of cloud in structured spending comes back that we'll be in a good position. We're still investing in the products and feel good about the position we have with the major cloud vendors.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTom O'Malley: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I just -- I wanted to narrow in on the HDD side. There's been a variance of timing of recovery across the industry. Could you just give us your latest -- on when you think the cloud portion of your HDD business is going to recover? I know you previously have said the fourth quarter, has there been any push out in that expectation? And could you also just comment on the health? I know it's down this quarter, but just the health of that HDD business as you're seeing it today. So just the timing of the recovery and how it's been today?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I think as we moved, you know, so first of all, we think we're going to see sequential exabyte growth in capacity enterprise HDD throughout the fiscal year, but it's going to be towards the end of the year, end of the first quarter where we start to get line of sight to all of the customers coming back. I think we're having discussions across all of our customers about what they're -- we always have conversations, but some of the big ones have been in inventory digestion for quite a while. So we're getting better line of sight to the end of that. But I think we still have a couple of quarters to go, but improving I think next quarter things will be stable. It will be a bit of mix impact there. We expect client to be a little bit more challenged in this quarter. But I think as we move throughout the year, things will get better. And I think your timing of a couple more quarters of getting through phase and as we get into early next year, we expect things to look better.\nTom O'Malley: Helpful. And then also in the HDD business, your competitor, kind of, talked about being more aggressive in certain areas on pricing. Have you guys also looked to be more aggressive on pricing and any comments that you have on just your strategy with clients on the pricing side? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Pricing really starts with innovation. I mean, I think that's where we -- we're staging our 28 T Ultra SMR product. We're really happy with where Ultra SMR is at. EPMR opting in and we're already staging our next product for growth there. That's the underpinnings of where we're able to bring a better TCO proposition to our customers. And as we do that, we're able to share in the benefits of that as those drives gets deployed. The rest of the market is more market driven pricing. We have a lot of different channels, a lot of different markets we sell into. And that type of pricing is just is more of what you would typically think in any big market around supply and demand.\nTom O'Malley: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I told them personally with some Flash side [Technical Difficulty] and June was [Technical Difficulty]. Just so that the pricing should improve after or revenue should improve after December. Is that a function of overall NAND pricing getting better, or your specific exposure to retail and PCs above BU? And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: I missed the first part of the question\u2026\nPeter Andrew: Yes. Sorry. Sorry, Krish. Could you please repeat?\nA \u2013 David Goeckeler: Sorry, Krish. You know, we never agreed. There was a little bit of static on the line.\nQ \u2013 Krish Sankar: I apologize. I was just trying to figure out the pricing [Indiscernible] in June. We spoke about the revenue improvement. Is it a function of NAND pricing improving or just statistic [Indiscernible] your targeted retail and PC is going to get better?\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. I think I got it at that time. So NAND pricing, so first of all, in the last quarter, NAND price -- you saw like-for-like pricing down 9%, blended down 6%, so moderating from the quarter before. Next quarter, we expect volume to pick up, which will drive -- volume pick up margin to be impacted a little bit more from where it is today. So continue to moderate, but volume picking up. Does that help answer your question? I don't know. I didn't get all of your questions, Krish. so I'm sorry if I'm not answering it.\nKrish Sankar: No, no. I think it does. It does. I was just trying to figure out the specific and verticals, which is PCs and retail.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I got you. So as we said, we saw the client and consumer markets return to growth -- exabyte growth and sequential revenue growth. So we see those markets have kind of through their inventory digestion and more shipping to end demand so that -- we expect that to continue as we go forward.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks David. And then a quick follow-up on hard drive. You said that you're sampling the 8-terabyte ePMR. Is the 32 terabyte ePMR still on your road map? And are you like doing that by increasing the number of disks per drive? And how do you think about the gross margin [Technical Difficulty] to terabyte?\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. So let me -- again. I think I got most of the questions. So we're not adding more disks I mean, Ultra SMR is -- it's a combination of our ePMR, OptiNAND and Ultra SMR technology. So the next step on the roadmap, I think we've talked a lot over the last year, plus about this driving from 20 to 30 plus with a set of technologies around ePMR, OptiNAND, Ultra SMR. And this is the next step in that roadmap. We still have a couple of more steps to go. So we'll announce the products one at a time, but we're happy with where we are and continue to drive innovation. And as demand comes back, we'll be ramping into a great set of products. And these are products that can be staged quickly and ramp in volumes very quickly, very established technology. And the 26-terabyte drive, Ultra SMR drive, we really -- that sold at scale this quarter and we expect a significant growth in that in the next quarter as well.\nKrish Sankar: Awesome. Very good update. Very helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. So we've had a few head fakes on phone recovery on the cloud side, particularly in HDDs. And wondering as you think through, sort of, this improvement starting in fiscal 2Q, what's underpinning some of the confidence? You noted demand recovery. Are you seeing particular signs from customers that are pointing to that? And your primary competitor also noted taking some changes, including a build-to-order philosophy. Curious if you guys are contemplating any such changes. And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, Wamsi. So first of all, yes, I mean, you hit it. I mean we have ongoing and very significant conversations with our customers on a -- many quarters out, so that's what gives us -- that's what underpins the view we have. To your point, things can change, but that's the current view and the conversations are productive and positive. On the build, the order comment, look, I think the industry is going to come out of -- well, let me speak about us. So Western Digital will come out of this downturn. It's a pretty severe downturn in a cyclical industry, but we've done a lot of things that I think the business is going to be different on the other side of this. So first of all, we've taken a significant amount of capacity out-of-the system. We've talked about the shifts from client to capacity enterprise, at least as long as I've been here and it's been going on for many, many years before that. I think that transition is going to be essentially done. There is a long tail on any technology, but if you look on a unit basis, we'll come out of this with significant less spending on our infrastructure. We'll have the lowest fixed-cost we've had in a decade-plus in our HDD infrastructure, and we'll really be focused exclusively on that client enterprise business going forward. That's not a -- we still have a client business. Don't get me wrong. It's still going to be there. Like I said, there's a long-tail of technology. But I think as part of that, the industry will come out and we will come out of this as more of a build-the-order, if you will, as opposed to a build to forecast. So that's why we're having these conversations with our customers because it is a it is a long build time on an HDD, and we want to make sure that we've got the infrastructure in place. We've got the components in place, and we're running the right process to deliver what our customers need at the right time. So I think that maybe the short answer to your question is yes, Western Digital will be -- is going to more of that kind of process.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Dave, and just a clarification on the underutilization charges, which look roughly flattish quarter-on-quarter. Are those charges roughly similar in flash and HDD this past quarter? Or are there different moving pieces underlying that for September?\nWissam Jabre: Sure, Wamsi. So when you look at the September quarter, the guide at $200 million to $220 million of underutilization charges and they're split roughly 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And I would -- just to clarify also to add with respect probably to the following quarter. I expect -- sorry, underutilization related charges to be let's say, 5% to 10% down and most of the -- if not all of the decrease would be coming from HDD.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you, Wissam.\nWissam Jabre: You\u2019re welcome.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wamsi.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the cloud weakness again. I understand the cloud things could be lumpy. But curious about your conversations with the large hyperscale guys. How has that changed around a quarter ago? Are they giving you signals about when inventory will start stabilizing? Are they worried about supply in the second half given production cuts by all the suppliers? And are they more receptive to purchase commitments?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. What I would say is the it's always a very robust conversation given the amount of business we do with the hyperscalers. It's clear that some of them have been in a very severe inventory digestion phase and kind of took a pause on buying anything, but we're back to having conversations with those customers. I mean, they're still growing. And storage is still being created and growing. So we expect those conversations in those businesses to the buying will reemerge and we're having the conversations on when that will happen and in what magnitude just to make sure that we've got all of our capacity aligned to deliver that. I think we're getting very good reception on the product road map. As we talked about our 22, 24, 26 terabyte platform and products have now been qualified by all of the major cloud vendors. We're just -- we expect to ramp those significantly, especially the 26 T next quarter. That's really becoming a major capacity point for some of the biggest cloud builders. And right on the back of that, we're launching a 28 T UltraSMR drive. So the conversations are strong, and it's about making sure we have clear alignment on what their requirements are going to be and that we get the proper manufacturing in place to deliver on that.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Maybe a quick follow-up on the Hard Drive side. Clearly, you guys have been better than the competitor last quarter. But I just want to hone in on the SMR drives, which you said have qualified at all major cloud customers. Can you give us an idea what SMR adoption is today and where you think it will be in a few quarters from now? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: SMR, it's very idiosyncratic. I mean the intersection of adoption and inventory digestion makes it very lumpy. And if you look at the current quarter or last quarter, but I can say going forward that several of the major cloud providers are standardizing on an SMR deployment, UltraSMR for us, and we expect have a significant ramp of that technology over the next several quarters.\nSidney Ho: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Sidney.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had one clarification and then a question. David, on NAND ASPs for the current quarter, I guess you talked about bids being up double digits sequentially, and you're kind of guiding revenue to flat sequentially. So I guess, the implied ASPs are down perhaps a little bit more than what they were down in the June quarter, but you talked about moderation. So is the sharper price decline in September that's implied in guidance or embedded in guidance, primarily a function of mix? Or am I missing something there?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. It may be a little bit -- sequentially, maybe a little bit lower than what you're modeling. So I think that's where it is. Toshiya, we can follow up with you on kind of more details, but I think that's probably the clarification.\nToshiya Hari: Okay. Got it. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Wissam. You mentioned that for fiscal '24, you plan to cut CapEx significantly. Curious if it's purely impacting your capacity decisions in NAND? Or are there any changes or shifts to how you think about the road map? And related to that, I think on a bit shipments, David, you mentioned for calendar \u201824, you guys are going to be, I think, down low single digits. But how should we think about bit production in calendar '24, given the CapEx and production cuts that you're going through right now?\nWissam Jabre: Well, maybe let me first start with the first part of the question on CapEx, Toshiya. The comment on CapEx is -- well, when you look at calendar -- sorry, fiscal '23, we've taken quite a bit of CapEx out from our plans as we continue to preserve cash. I mean you can see that we've spent, I think, year-on-year, we're down roughly 30% to 35%. And it's almost $1 billion lower than -- at the gross CapEx level, almost $1 billion lower than what our plan was at the beginning of the year for fiscal '23. For fiscal '24, we're projecting to be significantly lower. It's mostly in line -- it doesn't impact necessarily our product road map. It is more or less what we see today relative to what our NAND or basically other types of investments, meaning no other transitions or other types of investments planned. And so I wouldn't say there's any major change relative to what we've already been planning. But given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in, we will continue to monitor, just like we've done in fiscal '23 on a quarterly basis and adjust as needed.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, Toshiya.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering, you have any unique perspective having both HDDs and SSDs. There's commentary coming out of Pure, and I'm hearing more from some of the other storage vendors of a growing use of or cloud within data -- or sorry, growing use of SSDs within cloud and data centers and almost like a potential secular shift. Again, Pure takes it kind of to the extreme. But I'm just wondering how you think about how the mix will trend over time, maybe layer in AI, if you want? And just think about [Technical Difficulty] we should worry about what are you hearing from your customers? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Hey Shannon, thanks for the question. We've talked about this a lot over the years. I think that both technologies are growing in the data center. HDD is the predominant storage mechanism in the data center we don't expect that to change. Our customers don't expect that to change. As long as we continue to drive the HCD road map forward, we just -- we're ramping 26 terabyte. We're already launching 28 terabytes. So we're moving forward with capacity points on HDD. And we expect robust growth of HDD storage in the data center going forward. We also expect growth of enterprise SSD storage in the data center going forward. It's probably growing a little bit faster than HDD, but not in a way where you're looking at one is a substitute for the other. They're highly complementary technologies, and we expect that to be the case for any useful planning horizon in the future. We look at a decade out. The cost differences are still significant, and that's certainly the way we talk to our customers about how they're building mass scale data centers.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Great. And Wissam, can you talk a little bit about OpEx? How you're thinking about it relative to maybe a more normalized level? And how much loan for the model as revenues come back before you have to start spending more from an OpEx perspective?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, sure. So on OpEx, you saw we continue to manage it very, very tightly in fiscal Q4. We ended at $582 million, which is around $180 million lower than the same quarter last year. As to your question, over the near term, I think we're within sort of the range where we expect to be. But as the business starts coming back, there could be some small increase as we start layering up some of the variable expenses on that. However, we should never -- we shouldn't expect the increase in OpEx to be faster than the increase in revenue. And so we would be monitoring that, and it will be gradual. And similarly, if there's a need for us to take additional action on OpEx to continue to manage very tightly. We also have some room to do that.\nDavid Goeckeler: Michelle, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We sure can. Just one moment. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had two, Wissam. The first one is on underutilization charges. And it's kind of like a two-part question. So the first is what's the current utilization in NAND? And then on the HDD side, is there kind of a mild post as to where these could start to go away? Because you're guiding $70 million for September for underutilization in HDD. It sounds like it goes to maybe 60 to 65 in December quarter. But when does it go away because you started to take underutilization charges. I think when HDD revenue went sub $2-billion per quarter. So do we have to get all the way back to $2 billion a quarter to have those HDD underutilization charges go away?\nWissam Jabre: Okay. So Tim, with respect to the Flash side, we continue to make these decisions on an ongoing basis. And from the numbers, you can tell the underutilization related charges were are projected to be roughly flat from Q4 to Q1. As for HDD, I think the math is -- your math on Q1 is close to where the guidance is. But I think in the December quarter, think of the underutilization charges going, let's say, from Q1 to Q2 going down 5% or 10% and all of that decrease coming from HDD, you start seeing some declines basically in the HDD underutilization in the December quarter. And based on what we see today, it's a bit too early to talk about the second-half of the fiscal year 2024. But to the point you were making around the $2 billion revenue mark, we don't need to get to the $2 billion revenue mark to really fully utilize our capacity. If you recall, we've restructured quite a bit of our manufacturing capacity in the Hard Drive business, and we continue to take and optimize that fixed cost aspect of the cost structure. And so we can be fully utilized at a lower level than $2 billion, given the current cost structure.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot for that, Wissam. And then just on the debt service cost. So you have the convert due in February. I think that's at a pretty good rate. I think it's at 1.5%. So the debt you're going to replace that with, I imagine, is going to be pretty expensive. So it seems sort of -- I guess my question is sort of where does that leave you in the cap structure? Obviously, it seems like debt service costs are going to go up maybe $20 million a quarter once you have to issue new debt for that. So can you just talk about sort of how you solve for all that? Thanks.\nWissam Jabre: So yes, the current rate on the convert is 1.5%. And given where the interest rate environment is today, I would expect that to be replaced by that -- when replaced by that to be roughly more expensive than that. So look, it's a little bit too early to talk about it in a lot of details, but this is something that is definitely a focus for us as we think through the various options that are available to us. With respect to refinancing, for instance, we look at the potential cost of capital and our goal is to make sure that we maintain a lower cost of capital to the extent possible. But I expect it to be slightly up from here, all said.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Wissam.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Thanks, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Thanks so much. Really just -- two quick ones, if I could. When would you expect 26 terabyte and maybe I'll even through 28 in there since you mentioned it, David, there each crossover. And then I just have a quick follow-up to that. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Crossover as -- look, let me say that -- there's a lot of -- there's multiple different capacity points. So I think we need to maybe talk about this a little bit different. It doesn't just move from 14, 16, 18, maybe like it did two, three years ago. Now there's a bit of distribution of different customers and what kind of technologies they're using, whether it's 20s or 22s or 26s or going to 28s or even some 24s. So as I look at where things are going to be in the next couple of quarters, you're going to see a pretty even distribution across three or four different capacity points, all of them shipping 0.5 million or more drive. So we expect a very substantial ramp of 26. I don't want to take away from the ramp that's going to happen there. It's going to be very quick and very rapid now that it's qualified and getting close to being a leading capacity point in the next couple of quarters.\nAnanda Baruah: Thanks for making the distinction. That's actually really helpful. And the follow-up is, do you guys have any view yet, any opinion, on when things normalize out in hard drives, if the hyperscalers return to what their classic utilization levels have been historically, how they run the capacity? Or do you think they settle in somewhat different on the utilization?\nDavid Goeckeler: Look, I think anytime you go through a period like this, there's some work done on optimization of the infrastructure and consolidation, I think that's happening. But I would expect things -- you go through that and you just incrementally get better. Like anything in technology, you're constantly improving, constantly getting more efficient. I think that, that is something that's always going to go on and we're still going to see the growth in exabytes on top of that. So I think we're still looking at 20%, 25% exabyte growth in the HDD business. And I think we clearly haven't seen that in the last year, but we know it's a cyclical business, and we expect to get back to those levels.\nAnanda Baruah: Right. That\u2019s awesome. Thanks a lot.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question is going to come from the line of Karl Ackerman before we have a short statement by our CEO.\nKarl Ackerman: Could you discuss how we should think about a recovery in nearline units and unit pricing as you and your peer implement a build-to-order process? And as you address that question, can you discuss how this build-to-order process may differ from long-term agreements signed in 2021 that were a bit challenging to implement over time?\nDavid Goeckeler: So units, I expect to recover, right? I mean we're going to get exabyte growth. We're at a low point on units. We expect units to recover and get back to where they were and eclipse that actually as we continue to get exabyte growth. I'll put in say, a once again, I am very excited about generative AI. I know everybody is. But I think it's going to come to our world on storage once all this gets deployed. And so I expect to see units recover. I think the build-to-order process is going to be a fairly straightforward process because we have deep relationships with set of customers here. It's a big market. It's a big relationship. And I think it's just getting the business model to a place where there's better alignment between the infrastructure we have in place. Again, we've been talking about this for many years now that in a lot of ways, cloud has significantly benefited from the reduction in client and there's been a consistent availability of infrastructure to build hard drives. And we're at the end of that transition now, so we have to just have more planning around that. I think the long-term agreements were a step into that. I think this is maybe the next step into how do we run our franchise to make sure we've got the best alignment between delivering a great product and value proposition to our customers, which is extremely important, the storage is an incredibly important part of the data center and making sure that we have the right infrastructure in place to fuel that growth. So I expect it to be a pretty natural change or evolution of the business model, and I expect it to be a very positive on all sides. Thank you, Karl. All right, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. Western Digital's fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded expectations as our access to broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to capture demand upsides in both client and consumer end-markets, reaffirming our strength in a challenging market environment. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.7 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Before diving into the specifics of the quarter and the full fiscal year, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments in fiscal year 2023. Importantly, we continued to optimize our operations and successfully executed our innovative product roadmap, priming ourselves for greater profitability when demand rebounds across hard drives and flash. Throughout the fiscal year, we were focused on enhancing our product leadership and reinforcing our business agility. In HDD, we have successfully qualified our latest family of capacity enterprise hard drives that all major customers and are shipping our 26-terabyte Ultra SMR drive in high volume. In Flash, we pioneered the use of wafer bonding and advanced 3D NAND manufacturing and introduced the groundbreaking technology in BiCS8, which sets the foundation for future 3D NAND scaling. On the expense front, we streamlined investments across our HDD and Flash portfolio, which enabled us to significantly reduce quarterly operating expense, while continuing to deliver innovative products and technologies that address customers' growing storage needs. Further, we have reduced our cash capital expenditure run rate by over 50% in the fiscal second-half and consolidated our hard drive manufacturing footprint. These efforts enabled Western Digital to preserve capital, while effectively executing on product strategies and aligning our supply with post-pandemic demand environment. Notably, we reduced our inventory by nearly $300 million sequentially and exited fiscal year 2023 at a much healthier level than a few quarters ago. And in June, we successfully completed amendments to our credit agreements, which provide Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility as we navigate macro dynamics. In summary, we continue to proactively take action to bolster our agility, enhance our liquidity position, optimize our inventory levels across HDD and Flash, and strengthened our position as an industry and market leader. We exited fiscal year 2023 well-positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and capture long-term growth opportunities in data storage, spanning from client to edge to cloud. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the strategic review is ongoing. We continue to make progress on this process and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Turning to the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue in both client and consumer end-markets returned to sequential growth led by normalized end-market demand and higher average capacity per unit in Flash. In consumer, retail flash exceeded our expectations across all major product categories. We saw similar results in client with upside in both HDD and Flash and across almost all major product categories, including client SSD, gaming console, embedded flash and client hard drives. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remained subdued. I'll now turn to a business update, starting with HDD. In the fiscal fourth quarter, ongoing cloud weakness drove the overall decline in HDD revenue. However, demand for both client and consumer hard drives has stabilized and exceeded our expectations. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have successfully qualified all variance of our 22 terabyte CMR and 26 terabyte Ultra SMR hard drive platforms at all major cloud customers, setting the stage to improve shipments and profitability. In addition, we are about to begin product sampling of our 28 terabyte Ultra SMR drive. This cutting-edge product is built upon the success of our ePMR and Ultra SMR technologies with features and reliability trusted by our customers worldwide. We are staging this product for quick qualification and ramp as demand improves. Turning to Flash, revenue increased sequentially led by growth in both client and consumer flash bit shipments, which exceeded our expectations with total bit shipments returning to year-over-year growth. The stronger-than-expected bit growth is attributable to normalizing PC and consumer demand, as well as content growth. Average capacity per consumer and client SSD increased over 40% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. Moving to technology developments, we continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 based on a chip, bonded to array architecture. BiCS8 solidifies Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost capital efficiency and I/O performance into the future. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspective on our outlook. In HDD, as we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect overall demand to remain stable. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both improving demand and new product ramps to drive growth in revenue and profitability. In Flash, we are encouraged by several indicators signaling improving market dynamics. Notably, our two largest end markets, client and consumer are returning to growth, inventories are normalizing, content per unit is increasing and price declines have been moderating. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam. Thanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up. Fiscal year 2023 marked a period of exceptional progress and strategic planning for Western Digital. We diligently optimized our operations and executed our innovative product roadmap, priming ourselves for greater profitability as demand inevitably rebounds across hard drives and flash. As we move forward, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities and deliver continued success. Before opening up for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to recognize Siva Sivaram, our esteemed President of Technology and Strategy. Siva will be leaving Western Digital to pursue a great leadership opportunity in a different technology domain. Siva has made significant contributions to Western Digital and SanDisk over the past 10-years and he is a wonderful friend. We wish him all the best going forward. Peter, let's start the Q&A. Yes. Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. NAND in the current quarter, as we said, we saw a good, I guess good market reaction in consumer and in the client business, both returned to growth on an exabyte basis. They both were sequential grower, so we saw incremental upside there, so we were happy about that. We are still underutilizing the fab. I'll let Wissam talk about that in a little bit more detail. We do plan to underutilize for another couple of quarters, but we feel good about the overall -- the signs in the overall market, price declines are moderating, our inventory is down, bit shipments are up and we expect bit shipments to be up again double-digits next quarter. So not quite where we want to be yet, but the market is stabilizing and we see a lot of good things -- a lot of metrics going in the right direction. Thanks, Joe. Okay. Hey, C.J., right? C.J., that was very -- it was a little tough to hear you there, but I think we got the gist of the question, which was supply demand normalization. Is that right in Flash? No, that's right. Okay. So look, I think as I said, there are a number of things we saw in the market. This quarter we saw sequential bit growth overall, we saw clients and consumer returning to exabyte growth on a year-over-year basis, with consumer SSD content up 40%, client SSD up 20%. We saw our inventory down. We think in the client -- in the consumer and client markets, PC markets basically shipping to demand at this point. We expect our -- for the fiscal year, we saw our bits about flat year-over-year. For the calendar year, we see them down low-single-digits. We probably see the industry down a little lower than that. So we're taking the actions to bring supply and demand better into balance, and I think we're seeing that across our markets. Cloud is still -- there's still a couple of quarters ago, there that's a larger story, but in our two biggest markets for Flash, we're seeing that supply-demand balance start to move closer together, put it that way. Okay. I think that was the strategic review and timing, C.J. So as the process is active, we look forward to talking more about it when we reach a conclusion. Thank you. Yes. I've been thinking a lot about generative AI. It's clearly a big topic these days and obviously, a lot of spend going on to build out the infrastructure in the cloud, which I think, quite frankly, is a great thing. The cloud distribution model of new technology is something that is pretty amazing. That's been built out over the last decade, so we all get access to this technology very rapidly. And when I think about this in the storage domain, clearly, the compute infrastructure is being built out now, but what we're all going to be enabled with there are like incredible tools to automate data creation at many different levels, whether it's text data, video data. Whatever it happens to be, I think that we're essentially going to really accelerate our ability all of us to create information that needs to be stored. So I see this is kind of a catalyst for just a profound increase in the amount of data creation. I think that once those tools get distributed and we all start using them, I think that drives incremental growth across SSDs and hard drives. I mean hard drives are the foundational storage in the cloud. It's going to be that way for a very long-time. So while Gen AI may have some disruptions on the business in the near-term, as the compute infrastructure gets built out, very optimistic that this is a - as I said, I think it's a profound -- it's a catalyst for a profound increase in the rate of data creation. So quite excited about that. We don't know exactly what -- how you model that just yet, except that there is new innovation drives new data creation, which drives the need for storage. So we look forward as these -- as this infrastructure gets built out and rapidly adopted, the impact it's going to have on our business. Now on enterprise SSD, we still have the qualifications. We've recently qualified BiCS5 in some of these places. That market along with nearline HDD or capacity enterprise HDD is depressed right now or subdued. So we're not seeing a lot of growth in that. But we fully expect that when that market comes back and that part of cloud in structured spending comes back that we'll be in a good position. We're still investing in the products and feel good about the position we have with the major cloud vendors. Thank you. Yes, I think as we moved, you know, so first of all, we think we're going to see sequential exabyte growth in capacity enterprise HDD throughout the fiscal year, but it's going to be towards the end of the year, end of the first quarter where we start to get line of sight to all of the customers coming back. I think we're having discussions across all of our customers about what they're -- we always have conversations, but some of the big ones have been in inventory digestion for quite a while. So we're getting better line of sight to the end of that. But I think we still have a couple of quarters to go, but improving I think next quarter things will be stable. It will be a bit of mix impact there. We expect client to be a little bit more challenged in this quarter. But I think as we move throughout the year, things will get better. And I think your timing of a couple more quarters of getting through phase and as we get into early next year, we expect things to look better. Yes. Pricing really starts with innovation. I mean, I think that's where we -- we're staging our 28 T Ultra SMR product. We're really happy with where Ultra SMR is at. EPMR opting in and we're already staging our next product for growth there. That's the underpinnings of where we're able to bring a better TCO proposition to our customers. And as we do that, we're able to share in the benefits of that as those drives gets deployed. The rest of the market is more market driven pricing. We have a lot of different channels, a lot of different markets we sell into. And that type of pricing is just is more of what you would typically think in any big market around supply and demand. Thanks, Tom. I missed the first part of the question... Okay. I think I got it at that time. So NAND pricing, so first of all, in the last quarter, NAND price -- you saw like-for-like pricing down 9%, blended down 6%, so moderating from the quarter before. Next quarter, we expect volume to pick up, which will drive -- volume pick up margin to be impacted a little bit more from where it is today. So continue to moderate, but volume picking up. Does that help answer your question? I don't know. I didn't get all of your questions, Krish. so I'm sorry if I'm not answering it. Yes. I got you. So as we said, we saw the client and consumer markets return to growth -- exabyte growth and sequential revenue growth. So we see those markets have kind of through their inventory digestion and more shipping to end demand so that -- we expect that to continue as we go forward. Okay. So let me -- again. I think I got most of the questions. So we're not adding more disks I mean, Ultra SMR is -- it's a combination of our ePMR, OptiNAND and Ultra SMR technology. So the next step on the roadmap, I think we've talked a lot over the last year, plus about this driving from 20 to 30 plus with a set of technologies around ePMR, OptiNAND, Ultra SMR. And this is the next step in that roadmap. We still have a couple of more steps to go. So we'll announce the products one at a time, but we're happy with where we are and continue to drive innovation. And as demand comes back, we'll be ramping into a great set of products. And these are products that can be staged quickly and ramp in volumes very quickly, very established technology. And the 26-terabyte drive, Ultra SMR drive, we really -- that sold at scale this quarter and we expect a significant growth in that in the next quarter as well. Thank you. Hey, Wamsi. So first of all, yes, I mean, you hit it. I mean we have ongoing and very significant conversations with our customers on a -- many quarters out, so that's what gives us -- that's what underpins the view we have. To your point, things can change, but that's the current view and the conversations are productive and positive. On the build, the order comment, look, I think the industry is going to come out of -- well, let me speak about us. So Western Digital will come out of this downturn. It's a pretty severe downturn in a cyclical industry, but we've done a lot of things that I think the business is going to be different on the other side of this. So first of all, we've taken a significant amount of capacity out-of-the system. We've talked about the shifts from client to capacity enterprise, at least as long as I've been here and it's been going on for many, many years before that. I think that transition is going to be essentially done. There is a long tail on any technology, but if you look on a unit basis, we'll come out of this with significant less spending on our infrastructure. We'll have the lowest fixed-cost we've had in a decade-plus in our HDD infrastructure, and we'll really be focused exclusively on that client enterprise business going forward. That's not a -- we still have a client business. Don't get me wrong. It's still going to be there. Like I said, there's a long-tail of technology. But I think as part of that, the industry will come out and we will come out of this as more of a build-the-order, if you will, as opposed to a build to forecast. So that's why we're having these conversations with our customers because it is a it is a long build time on an HDD, and we want to make sure that we've got the infrastructure in place. We've got the components in place, and we're running the right process to deliver what our customers need at the right time. So I think that maybe the short answer to your question is yes, Western Digital will be -- is going to more of that kind of process. Thanks, Wamsi. Yes. What I would say is the it's always a very robust conversation given the amount of business we do with the hyperscalers. It's clear that some of them have been in a very severe inventory digestion phase and kind of took a pause on buying anything, but we're back to having conversations with those customers. I mean, they're still growing. And storage is still being created and growing. So we expect those conversations in those businesses to the buying will reemerge and we're having the conversations on when that will happen and in what magnitude just to make sure that we've got all of our capacity aligned to deliver that. I think we're getting very good reception on the product road map. As we talked about our 22, 24, 26 terabyte platform and products have now been qualified by all of the major cloud vendors. We're just -- we expect to ramp those significantly, especially the 26 T next quarter. That's really becoming a major capacity point for some of the biggest cloud builders. And right on the back of that, we're launching a 28 T UltraSMR drive. So the conversations are strong, and it's about making sure we have clear alignment on what their requirements are going to be and that we get the proper manufacturing in place to deliver on that. SMR, it's very idiosyncratic. I mean the intersection of adoption and inventory digestion makes it very lumpy. And if you look at the current quarter or last quarter, but I can say going forward that several of the major cloud providers are standardizing on an SMR deployment, UltraSMR for us, and we expect have a significant ramp of that technology over the next several quarters. Thank you, Sidney. Yes. It may be a little bit -- sequentially, maybe a little bit lower than what you're modeling. So I think that's where it is. Toshiya, we can follow up with you on kind of more details, but I think that's probably the clarification. Yes. Hey Shannon, thanks for the question. We've talked about this a lot over the years. I think that both technologies are growing in the data center. HDD is the predominant storage mechanism in the data center we don't expect that to change. Our customers don't expect that to change. As long as we continue to drive the HCD road map forward, we just -- we're ramping 26 terabyte. We're already launching 28 terabytes. So we're moving forward with capacity points on HDD. And we expect robust growth of HDD storage in the data center going forward. We also expect growth of enterprise SSD storage in the data center going forward. It's probably growing a little bit faster than HDD, but not in a way where you're looking at one is a substitute for the other. They're highly complementary technologies, and we expect that to be the case for any useful planning horizon in the future. We look at a decade out. The cost differences are still significant, and that's certainly the way we talk to our customers about how they're building mass scale data centers. Michelle, can we have the next question please? Crossover as -- look, let me say that -- there's a lot of -- there's multiple different capacity points. So I think we need to maybe talk about this a little bit different. It doesn't just move from 14, 16, 18, maybe like it did two, three years ago. Now there's a bit of distribution of different customers and what kind of technologies they're using, whether it's 20s or 22s or 26s or going to 28s or even some 24s. So as I look at where things are going to be in the next couple of quarters, you're going to see a pretty even distribution across three or four different capacity points, all of them shipping 0.5 million or more drive. So we expect a very substantial ramp of 26. I don't want to take away from the ramp that's going to happen there. It's going to be very quick and very rapid now that it's qualified and getting close to being a leading capacity point in the next couple of quarters. Look, I think anytime you go through a period like this, there's some work done on optimization of the infrastructure and consolidation, I think that's happening. But I would expect things -- you go through that and you just incrementally get better. Like anything in technology, you're constantly improving, constantly getting more efficient. I think that, that is something that's always going to go on and we're still going to see the growth in exabytes on top of that. So I think we're still looking at 20%, 25% exabyte growth in the HDD business. And I think we clearly haven't seen that in the last year, but we know it's a cyclical business, and we expect to get back to those levels. Thank you. So units, I expect to recover, right? I mean we're going to get exabyte growth. We're at a low point on units. We expect units to recover and get back to where they were and eclipse that actually as we continue to get exabyte growth. I'll put in say, a once again, I am very excited about generative AI. I know everybody is. But I think it's going to come to our world on storage once all this gets deployed. And so I expect to see units recover. I think the build-to-order process is going to be a fairly straightforward process because we have deep relationships with set of customers here. It's a big market. It's a big relationship. And I think it's just getting the business model to a place where there's better alignment between the infrastructure we have in place. Again, we've been talking about this for many years now that in a lot of ways, cloud has significantly benefited from the reduction in client and there's been a consistent availability of infrastructure to build hard drives. And we're at the end of that transition now, so we have to just have more planning around that. I think the long-term agreements were a step into that. I think this is maybe the next step into how do we run our franchise to make sure we've got the best alignment between delivering a great product and value proposition to our customers, which is extremely important, the storage is an incredibly important part of the data center and making sure that we have the right infrastructure in place to fuel that growth. So I expect it to be a pretty natural change or evolution of the business model, and I expect it to be a very positive on all sides. Thank you, Karl. All right, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded our expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, down 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Looking at end markets for the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 37% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 18% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to a decrease in capacity enterprise drive shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 59 exabytes, down 26% sequentially, driven by ongoing weakness at cloud customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in both hard drive and flash product shipments. Client represented 39% of total revenue at $1 billion, up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by growth in bit shipments for gaming consoles. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in flash pricing and lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Consumer represented 24% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 19% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher retail SSD shipments. The year-over-year decrease was driven by price declines in flash and lower retail hard drive shipments. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12.3 billion, down 34% from fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 17.2 percentage points to 15.7%, and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 21.8 percentage points to negative 4.8%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $3.59. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2023, cloud revenue decreased 34% year-over-year, primarily due to reduced shipments of capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs. Client revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in flash pricing, as well as lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Lastly, consumer revenue decreased 26% for the year as growth in retail SSD bit shipments was more than offset by broad-based flash price decline and lower consumer hard drive shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, HDD revenue was $1.3 billion, down 13% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 18% and average price per unit decreased 9% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, HDD exabyte shipments decreased 38% and average price per unit decreased 17%. Flash revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 43% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 6% on a blended basis and 9% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 15% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 3.9%, down 6.7 percentage points sequentially and 28.4 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $272 million in costs or 10.2 percentage points for manufacturing underutilization, flash inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 3.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.5 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to lower capacity enterprise volume, as well as higher underutilization-related charges. Underutilization charges were $76 million, or 5.9 percentage points. Flash gross margin was negative 11.9%, down 6.9 percentage points sequentially and 47.8 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges due to the reduced manufacturing volumes were $135 million, and inventory write-downs were $27 million, resulting in 11.8 percentage point reduction. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses of $582 million for the quarter, down $20 million sequentially and $178 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $478 million, driven mainly by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling $272 million. Income tax expense was $57 million for fiscal fourth quarter and $237 million for fiscal year 2023. Despite a consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal fourth quarter loss per share was $1.98, inclusive of $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was an outflow of $68 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $219 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, planning and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement were $151 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal fourth quarter. Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth-quarter as defined in our credit agreement, was $1.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 4.5 times, compared to 2.8 times in the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, the credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation add back associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in the cash-flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we executed an amendment to our credit agreements. These amendments include modifications to the leverage ratio requirements applicable through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which provide additional financial flexibility in the near-term. We also extended the commitment under the delayed-draw term-loan agreement to August 14th, 2023. Please refer to our earnings presentation for details. At the end-of-the quarter, total liquidity was $4.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion, and an unused delayed draw term-loan facility of $600 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal first quarter, I'll discuss our business outlook. For fiscal first quarter, sequentially, we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be relatively stable. In fiscal first quarter, we are continuing to adjust production to better match demand and anticipate underutilization charges to impact both HDD and Flash gross margins along with product mix pressures on Flash ASP. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both HDD and Flash revenue to improve through the remainder of fiscal year 2024, driven by normalizing demand in storage, as well as higher average content per unit in Flash. Gross margin is expected to gradually improve driven by higher HDD volume and lower underutilization charges in both Flash and HDD. We will continue to tightly manage our cost structure and expenses as we navigate the challenging environment. For fiscal year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to decline significantly. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.75 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 2.5% and 4.5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $200 million to $220 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $570 million to $590 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal first quarter and $130 million to $170 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect the loss per share of $1.80 to $2.10, assuming approximately 323 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Yes, Joe. And with respect to underutilization, we saw similar type of underutilization charges in fiscal Q4 versus Q3. For the Flash side, and when you look at HDD, we had a bit of more underutilization. But sticking with the Flash, also in our guidance, we've noted similar levels into fiscal Q1. Albeit, if you look at, sort of, the range of $200 million to $220 million, I would say it is split 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And also we're -- if I think of, let's say, the fiscal Q2, I anticipate more or less similar levels of underutilization from where we stand today. So with respect to uses of cash, as you noted, we do have the convert that matures in February \u201824, and we plan to address that this quarter or the next one. We also have the IRS settlement that is coming up and we expect also this payment to be very likely this quarter. But with respect to liquidity, exiting fiscal Q4, we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity. And so if you recall the delayed-draw term loan was put in place in the event we need to address the IRS settlement. So that will be drawn down to take care of the IRS settlement when it happens. And with respect to the convert, I mentioned we'd address it in the coming two quarters. You're welcome. Sure, Wamsi. So when you look at the September quarter, the guide at $200 million to $220 million of underutilization charges and they're split roughly 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And I would -- just to clarify also to add with respect probably to the following quarter. I expect -- sorry, underutilization related charges to be let's say, 5% to 10% down and most of the -- if not all of the decrease would be coming from HDD. You're welcome. Well, maybe let me first start with the first part of the question on CapEx, Toshiya. The comment on CapEx is -- well, when you look at calendar -- sorry, fiscal '23, we've taken quite a bit of CapEx out from our plans as we continue to preserve cash. I mean you can see that we've spent, I think, year-on-year, we're down roughly 30% to 35%. And it's almost $1 billion lower than -- at the gross CapEx level, almost $1 billion lower than what our plan was at the beginning of the year for fiscal '23. For fiscal '24, we're projecting to be significantly lower. It's mostly in line -- it doesn't impact necessarily our product road map. It is more or less what we see today relative to what our NAND or basically other types of investments, meaning no other transitions or other types of investments planned. And so I wouldn't say there's any major change relative to what we've already been planning. But given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in, we will continue to monitor, just like we've done in fiscal '23 on a quarterly basis and adjust as needed. Thanks, Toshiya. Yes, sure. So on OpEx, you saw we continue to manage it very, very tightly in fiscal Q4. We ended at $582 million, which is around $180 million lower than the same quarter last year. As to your question, over the near term, I think we're within sort of the range where we expect to be. But as the business starts coming back, there could be some small increase as we start layering up some of the variable expenses on that. However, we should never -- we shouldn't expect the increase in OpEx to be faster than the increase in revenue. And so we would be monitoring that, and it will be gradual. And similarly, if there's a need for us to take additional action on OpEx to continue to manage very tightly. We also have some room to do that. Okay. So Tim, with respect to the Flash side, we continue to make these decisions on an ongoing basis. And from the numbers, you can tell the underutilization related charges were are projected to be roughly flat from Q4 to Q1. As for HDD, I think the math is -- your math on Q1 is close to where the guidance is. But I think in the December quarter, think of the underutilization charges going, let's say, from Q1 to Q2 going down 5% or 10% and all of that decrease coming from HDD, you start seeing some declines basically in the HDD underutilization in the December quarter. And based on what we see today, it's a bit too early to talk about the second-half of the fiscal year 2024. But to the point you were making around the $2 billion revenue mark, we don't need to get to the $2 billion revenue mark to really fully utilize our capacity. If you recall, we've restructured quite a bit of our manufacturing capacity in the Hard Drive business, and we continue to take and optimize that fixed cost aspect of the cost structure. And so we can be fully utilized at a lower level than $2 billion, given the current cost structure. So yes, the current rate on the convert is 1.5%. And given where the interest rate environment is today, I would expect that to be replaced by that -- when replaced by that to be roughly more expensive than that. So look, it's a little bit too early to talk about it in a lot of details, but this is something that is definitely a focus for us as we think through the various options that are available to us. With respect to refinancing, for instance, we look at the potential cost of capital and our goal is to make sure that we maintain a lower cost of capital to the extent possible. But I expect it to be slightly up from here, all said."

Western Digital\u2019s third quarter performance exceeded expectations with core metrics at the high-end of our guidance range, demonstrating the company's resilience in a challenging market environment. We reported third quarter revenue of 2.8 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 11% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.37. Over the last several years, our team is focused on enhancing business agility and delivering a range of innovative industry leading products that address the increasing data storage demands of our customers. The groundwork we laid combined with the actions we have taken since the beginning of this fiscal year to right size and refocus our business have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment. I am pleased that we delivered non-GAAP gross margin at the higher-end of our guidance range due to strong execution across both our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, our early actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and focus our product offerings on delivering the best value for our data center customers have resulted in gross margin upside and profitable market share gains in HDD. In Flash, our broad go to market strategy anchored on our enviable retail franchise in a strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to optimize bid placement and bolster gross margin. During the fiscal third quarter, we saw signs of demand stabilizing across various end markets. In consumer, Our flash and HD results were consistent with the expectations we shared in January. In client, demand for each major product area came in better than we expected across PC OEM, channel, mobile and gaming. In cloud, demand for capacity enterprise hard drives improved whereas the demand for flash drives was consistent with our expectations set in January. Before I jump into updates on our HDD and Flash businesses, I would like to reiterate that the strategic review process is ongoing and we will provide updates as we have them. I'll now turn to the business update starting with HDD. During the fiscal third quarter, our HDD revenue improved sequentially with growth in capacity enterprise offsetting seasonal declines in retail and client. During the quarter, our 22 terabyte CMR drive became the highest volume product among all of our 20 terabyte and above capacity points. Demonstrating our leadership position at this capacity point. In addition, we expect the complete qualification of our 26 terabyte Ultra SMR technology in the fiscal fourth quarter. These innovative products provide multi-generation benefits to our customers. Turning to Flash, total exabyte shipment came in higher than expected in consumer, mobile, PC OEM, and channel products. Despite the industry experiencing the worst downturn in over a decade, Western Digital delivered positive product gross margin, excluding underutilization charges, driven by our unique combination of premium retail brands, broad go to market channels, and low cost flash supply from our joint venture fab with Kioxia. Furthermore, we continue to see encouraging signs of price elasticity driven content growth in retail flash led by WD Black, SSD optimized for gaming, as well as mobile PC OEMs and channel within client. On the technology front, BiCS6 achieved its anticipated cost crossover during the quarter. Moreover, on March 30, Western Digital and Kioxia announced our next generation BiCS8 node, a groundbreaking technology that builds upon the success of BiCS5 and BiCS6. This new technology is based on circuit bonded to array architecture, which provides several benefits, including reduced cycle time faster yield ramp, better or lateral scaling, and industry leading IO performance when compared to products based on circuit under array architecture. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 for a broad range of applications, which will position Western Digital for success as business conditions improve. As we look to the fiscal fourth quarter, in hard drives, overall demand will be impacted by ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers and a sustained decline in client. However, we are beginning to experience improved demand at certain customers in China. In Flash, we are seeing signs of stabilization and content increase per unit. PC OEMs have emerged from inventory digest and are now shipping closer to end demand. Gaming will remain strong, while enterprise SSD for cloud applications will remain soft. We anticipate modest growth in bit shipments into the fiscal fourth quarter. Before I hand the call over to Wissam, I would like to thank the Western Digital team for the response efforts they made in addressing the network security incident we disclosed on April 2nd. Our team took proactive and precautionary measures to secure our operations and successfully executed on our business continuity plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results reflected the challenging market environment with continued pressure on revenue and profitability. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, down 10% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.37. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 43% of total revenue at 1.2 billion, down 2% sequentially, driven by an increase in capacity enterprise drive shipments, which was offset by a decrease in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 79 exabytes, up 31% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue declined 32%, primarily due to a decline in shipments of both hard drive and flash products, as well as price decreases in Flash. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 10% sequentially and 44% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decrease was driven by price declines across our flash products and lower client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC application. Finally, consumer represented 22% of total revenue at 0.6 billion, down 22% sequentially, and 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was due to a seasonal decline in shipments of both retail hard drive and flash products, as well as price declines in retail flash. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and price declines in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. HDD revenue was 1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased [50%]] and average price per hard drive increased 10% to $109. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 23%, and average price per unit increased 9%. Flash revenue was 1.3 billion, down 21% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 10% on a blended basis and 12% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses, please note that my comments would be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 10.6%, down 6.8 percentage points sequentially and 21.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $275 million of charges for manufacturing underutilization, inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was higher than anticipated at 24.3%, up 3.6 percentage points sequentially and down 3.4 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher capacity enterprise volume, as well as lower manufacturing costs and underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were less than projected at approximately $40 million or 2.7 percentage points, partially benefiting from the actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and offsetting other charges of $22 million. Flash gross margin was negative 5%, down 19.5 percentage points sequentially, and 40.6 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges associated with the reduced manufacturing volumes were approximately $160 million or 12.2 percentage points, less than expected as we focused on lowering manufacturing costs. During the quarter, we incurred $53 million of flash inventory write-down charges resulting from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were at $602 million for the quarter, down 57 million sequentially and 138 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $304 million, driven by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling 275 million. Income tax expense was $60 million. Despite a consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal third quarter loss per share was $1.37, inclusive of a $9 million dividend cost associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was an out flow of 381 million and free cash flow was an outflow of 527 million. Cash, capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement was $146 million. Gross debt outstanding was 7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement was 2.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.8x, compared to 2.1x in the fiscal second quarter. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation addback associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.  At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $5.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of 2.2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of 2.25 billion, and unused delayed draw term loan facility of 875 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. We expect HDD revenue to decrease sequentially, due to ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers. We expect Flash revenue to decrease sequentially as modest growth in bit shipments is more than offset by ASP declines. We expect Flash bit shipment growth to accelerate in the first half of fiscal year 2024. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin will be negatively impacted by underutilization charges and Flash pricing. We continue to tightly manage our cost structures through this dynamic environment and expect operating expenses to be below $600 million.  For fiscal year 2023, we project gross capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion, and cash capital expenditures to be approximately 0.8 billion. The projected cash capital expenditures represent more than a 50% reduction from our forecast as we entered fiscal year 2023 and approximately 35% reduction from fiscal year 2022. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 3% and 5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $220 million to $240 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $580 million to $600 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately 90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $60 million and $70 million. We expect loss per share of $2.20 to $1.90, assuming approximately 321 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Over the past few quarters, we have successfully ramped a series of industry-leading storage products and commercialized innovative technologies, while concurrently rightsizing our cost structure. Our proactive actions have positioned Western Digital favorably for the future as demand gradually returns to normal levels. In closing, I would like to thank our team members for their unwavering commitment in advancing innovative products and driving operational efficiency. Their exceptional efforts have allowed Western Digital to deliver in [Technical Difficulty] to the dedication and support of our people worldwide, and we remain committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all that we do. Okay. I look forward to your questions. Let's open it up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I'd love to get a sense for where you're seeing demand stabilize versus where you still see pockets of inventory? And as part of that, I guess embedded in your revenue guide, it looks like you're kind of suggesting HDD down maybe 10% to 15%, SSD down 5% to 10%. So, I guess is that kind of the right way to think about it? And then as part of that, where do you think we're seeing stabilization and where do you think we need to work down inventory some more?\nDavid Goeckeler: Inventory correction there is mostly behind us. Our channel business performed really well this past quarter, I think, above what our expectation was. The inventory issue is still very much in data center and it's very lumpy. We have some big cloud customers that are consuming. We have others that are really in a full inventory digestion and aren't taking anything. So that market is still where we see a lot of inventory digestion going on. And I expect that to be lumpy for the next couple of quarters. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in China. We talked about that. I think it's setting up for recovery in the second half of the year, a lot more activity around RFPs and discussions about what demand is going to look like the second half. So, that's a bit \u2013 an overview of where we see the market. I think on your numbers, you're probably down a little more than we are on HDD. I think that's probably more a single-digit kind of number on a sequential basis.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, can you kind of walk us through what you're thinking today in terms of underutilization charges beyond the June quarter?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Well, let's talk about for each business. I mean, I think in HDD and I'm sure Wissam will have a little bit to add here as well. HDD, which is the smaller part of the number, but still significant we're going to see a drop in volume next quarter. So, we'll see some underutilization there. On the Flash side, we continue to underutilize the fab. We're managing it in a very dynamic way, kind of week-to-week month-to-month to make sure we've fully understand demand and keep our inventory in a position where we want it. And so \u2013 but we will definitely see underutilization on both sides of the business next quarter.\nWissam Jabre: And just to add \u2013 C.J., sorry, just to add a bit more color, I think we \u2013 in our guide, we're estimating around [220 to 240] [ph], the range of underutilization charges. And by business, this is roughly two-thirds Flash, one-thirds HDD or one-third [SSD] [ph].\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, C.J.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. You mentioned that you're taking lower cost for market charges on NAND, can you talk about the methodology there? Is that \u2013 do you pool that and then take a charge overall or is it anytime any individual product falls below the market price you adjusted down? \nDavid Goeckeler: So, Joe with respect to our LCM charges, we do it at the finished good product level. It is not pulled.\nJoe Moore: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of the underutilization charges and things like that, do you know how the covenants are going to be defined? Are you going to be able to remove those charges from the EBITDA number as defined in the covenant?\nDavid Goeckeler: Those are typically allowed to be added back per our credit agreement to the EBITDA.\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thank you for taking the questions. Just to build on that last question, just to be safe. Your gross margin expectation in this current quarter, I'm guessing the commentary assumes that you're not expecting another inventory charge in the flash business? And if so why not?\nWissam Jabre: So Aaron, we typically factor into our guidance all the expectations. And when we exited Q3, like a typical quarter, we do our reserve reviews and we take the \u2013 we make sure that the balance sheet properly stated. And so based on our forecast, everything is baked into the guidance. Typically, we have a small amount in the guidance just like we did also in the past quarter.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question is on the hard disk drive business, I can appreciate you guys seeing some cloud customers, kind of \u2013 it sounds like purchased really no product this last quarter. I'm guessing from a competitive perspective how would you characterize the current environment? Have you seen increased price aggressiveness? How do you guys think about the discussion around HAMR and your roadmap going forward, etcetera?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I mean, I think there's always price pressure in this market Aaron, but we've been very disciplined about the value of our products. I think you \u2013 one of the things we feel very good about is, we've been investing in our HDD roadmap, things like OptiNAND, ePMR, UltraSMR, these products are really now starting to ship in volume. We talked about the 22-terabyte CMR drive was the highest volume drive at 20 and above. So, we feel very good about where the portfolio is, about where it's going. We've got a number of very large customers qualifying SMR right now. That's clearly the next step in the data center, our UltraSMR product there, the 2016, we talked about we'll finish up calls this quarter and start deploying next quarter. So, we feel like we've got a portfolio that is aligned with what the market needs. And that's showing up in, kind of how we're able to monetize that portfolio and not have to compete on price. So, future technologies like HAMR will be there. We're still are ways away before that product is going to be a volume type product. The volume products are the 22s going and then SMR are going to be the big volume products over the next couple of years and after that we'll get to HAMR. We feel confident about that technology. It's been in development for a long time. We're in the final stages of it as an industry and I think everybody is excited that it will be the roadmap for 30 and above when we need it.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the network security breach. Can you give us an update on the recovery there? Looks like your operations are back to normal levels, but have you experienced or do you expect any more issues with productions or your ability to ship products?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we've been very transparent about that incident. When we noticed it, we let folks know, we took our \u2013 we basically disconnected ourselves from the public Internet to protect ourselves and then restore the environment. We still have capabilities inside the companies and the factories were operational throughout that. Clearly, a tremendous amount of work by the team, but we feel like we're nearly all the way back now as far as operation. We got to bring the store online in here in another week or so, but it was really, really good to see our business continuity plans, you don't want to rely on them too often, but when we had two, they were there and they kept the company moving forward.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great. Thanks for that update.\nWissam Jabre: Sorry, Sidney. I just wanted to add that for fiscal Q3, we don't have any impact in the numbers to the network security.\nSidney Ho: Okay. That's great. Maybe my follow-up question is, Samsung [indiscernible] talk about their cutting production. I'm curious if your competition with the customers have changed since that announcement, and related to that, do you expect the June quarter to be the bottom of \u2013 for your margins for your Flash business? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: I would say, we have \u2013 I mean obviously we have very robust conversations with our customers all the time. I wouldn't pin the tone of conversations on to how any one particular player in the market is acting or what they're doing. We stay very focused on our business. As far as where is the bottom, I mean we expect the market to come into balance as we go through the second half of the year. I think we're clearly taking a lot of actions in our own business to closely manage it, supply and demand. Keep the utilization of the fab close to where demand is. So, we manage our inventory. Clearly, we're going through one of the most severe downturns in a while, but we think as we move through the second half of the year the market will come into balance.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. One near term and more to with inventory. Your inventories are \u2013 absolute dollar value keeps going higher. And I want to understand how the mix is changing between wafers, finished good, and other material? Is there any way you can give us a color how incremental changes are happening for different categories within inventory, and have a follow-up?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, we typically don't break that out as much on the call. This is a bit too much detail, Mehdi, for me to discuss here. The one comment I would make though, when we think of inventory, our operations team is really focused on minimizing where we can. So, we basically try to stage it in the places that makes the most sense from a demand perspective.\nMehdi Hosseini: Let me rephrase the question. How do you \u2013 how should we think about the risk of inventory write-down?\nWissam Jabre: I mean, the inventory write-down typically is, it's really based \u2013 the ones that was, for instance, I called out is based on basically the inventory value relative to where the market price is. And so, if \u2013 when prices decline by a lot, then we do have to take a closer look and see if there's any impact, but that's what I would say about that.\nMehdi Hosseini: So, would \u2013 are you assuming that the rate of price decline is moderating, so maybe that would minimize the downside risk?\nWissam Jabre: What I'm saying is, we \u2013 what I'm saying is, at the end of every quarter our balance sheet is properly stated because we do look at where the inventory value is versus where the demand is and the prices are most particularly at the finished good level. And so, where we see differences we have to adjust our inventory value, otherwise it is properly stated. I guess your question is more around trying to predict where the price is going and we typically don't necessarily do that.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you. And then the question for David, looking at longer-term more than just one quarter. I think there is some confusion or unknown factor how new type of AI would impact demand for HDD versus SSD, do you have any view how this incremental demand created. These are expensive working stations. How is it going to impact SSD versus HDD?\nDavid Goeckeler: We're doing analysis on that, Mehdi. What I would say is, to me \u2013 I'll even go a little longer-term, bigger picture. This just reinforces the value of stored data. I think that it just seems like there's this constant ways for people can figure out how to use all the data they've stored to do very productive things with it. And I think the latest is training these AI engines. And so, we just think it's another element of the long-term value of data storage and it's just a big secular tailwind for the HDD business and the enterprise SSD business. I mean, again, you know that they're both \u2013 they both have big TAMs in the data center, and they're both growing. And we think this is another reason why people will store more data is because they can monetize it in different ways in the future.\nMehdi Hosseini: But I guess I was hoping you would shed some light as to how the HDD CAGR would change? I don't think this is going to lift the TAM for each different types of stores at the same rate. Is there any thoughts that you can share with us?\nDavid Goeckeler: I think it will \u2013 HDD is the lion's share of storage in the cloud. So, you would expect that's where the bigger lift would be across those two technologies.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks Mehdi. It\u2019s good to talk to you as always.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first is, as you look at what you're doing on OpEx in terms of holding in cost, how do you think about the \u2013 how you're \u2013 where you're investing? And how are you making those decisions? And how should we think about potential impact to future projects at this point? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We've been very \u2013 obviously, we've been \u2013 one of the things we've been building into the business over the last several years as we've restructured the business is more agility and the ability to proactively respond to the market we're in. I think that's kind of the hallmark of the organization we're trying to build is agile and dynamic. But clearly, on top of that, Shannon, we went to a business unit structure for a reason. It's because we have two very, very focused organizations with very sophisticated leaders in them that is constantly doing the ROI analysis of where we put our OpEx, and we get the most out of it. And I think quite frankly, that's led to the portfolio we have today. I think we have the best portfolio we've ever had. And that's an effort that goes on constantly, continuously. And so, as we continue to draw down OpEx to resize the business to the realities of what the market is. We've built the capability over the last couple of years to do that in a way where we can make sure we're going to get \u2013 first of all, the OpEx we spend, we get the best ROI out of it, the best return and that we make sure that we're making \u2013 we're taking actions to the business that don't harm the long-term value of it, and we make the right decision on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month basis. So, I think this is really a capability we've built in the last three years, and I think it's serving us well right now to make sure that we're not cutting in ways that are going to impact the long-term health of the business.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. That was helpful. I'm curious \u2013 and maybe I'm trying to make lemonade out of lemons. But I'm just wondering, as you've cut capacity on the HDD side, and you've had these underutilization charges, are there things that you've learned in terms of maybe how you manufactured in the past ways to drive incremental productivity? I'm just thinking it's kind of \u2013 it's certainly a unique time to maybe take a step back and look how things are \u2013 how things have been done and what you can do in the future? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: So, I'll make a few comments. I suspect Wissam will have a few comments as well. I mean this is \u2013 there's been a lot of focus on this in the last year of how do we become more efficient, how do we automate more. Several of our factories have won World Economic Forum Lighthouse awards for automation. How do we rescale our employees? And how do we just \u2013 we've been very focused on driving a level of automation, driving productivity, and just lowering our fixed cost asset base in the HDD business. And I think our fixed \u2013 I don't think I know, our fixed costs in that business are now the lowest they've been in well over a decade. So, I think that's paying off in the way we're able to generate margin in the business at lower volume levels. And then as the volume starts to pick back up, we've got capacity to meet what the market needs, and I think we'll do that at a much lower cost basis.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. I mean the one thing I would add also, in addition to what David said, some of the activities that we drive in terms of the manufacturing side are taken back into the development organizations to think about things that come on platforms and the ability to improve on the way our products are designed for manufacturing efficiency, even increasing manufacturing efficiency going forward. And of course, with that comes a better cost structure.\nShannon Cross: Alright. Thank you very much.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Shannon. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for talking my question. David, first question is on your NAND ASP decline in March quarter, seems to be better than what your competitors had. I'm just kind of curious, any puts and takes if you talk about your specific pricing versus competition in March, how to think about it in June? And along the same path, you mentioned the supply-demand balance later this year and bit shipment for flash growing. Are you baking in some, kind of a mobile recovery that's going to help you drive that? And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think on pricing, it's kind of the same story all the time, right? Whether it's a down market, upmarket, mid-cycle market, which is really have a diverse portfolio. We've talked about this a lot from retail to the channel business, PC OEMs, enterprise SSD gaming has become a very nice part of the portfolio and growing part of the portfolio. And it's just that \u2013 mobile, obviously, is a big part of our portfolio. And it's just been mixing across that where we get the best return, right, putting our supply and our bits in the places where we can get the best return. I do think that, that is a \u2013 that go to \u2013 that breadth of go-to-market is in markets that we can reach literally from every single consumer to the largest technology companies in the world and kind of everything in between. And just the ability to mix across that with a strong portfolio and a strong set of brands as well, SanDisk, SanDisk Professional, WD_BLACK, puts us in a good position to get the best return on our supply. Next quarter, we don't really want to comment on future pricing. It's all into the guide. We've talked about the individual markets. What I would say is, we're pricing in or we're putting in what we think is going to do on an individual market-by-market basis and then how we'll mix that next quarter.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for the dividend. And then as a follow-up on the HDD side, it's kind of nice to see the 22 terabyte CMR is now bigger than 20 terabytes in terms of volume. How should we expect that to grow? And what is its impact on gross margin?\nDavid Goeckeler: I think that's our focus \u2013 on a CMR drive, that's our focused capacity point and it's significantly ahead of other CMR drives above 20. So \u2013 or above the 20 terabyte drive. We expect that to be our premier drive for the next \u2013 until we have a different CMR product in that part of the business. So, we expect that to be a very good growth engine, and we've talked a lot about that drive of \u2013 it provides a lot of value. It provides a lot of TCO value for our customers. And we \u2013 it contributes an appropriate amount of margin from that perspective as well.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks David.\nDavid Goeckeler : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It's [indiscernible] filling in for Wamsi today. David, I think maybe another pricing question for you. I think you talked about price elasticity. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what exactly you're seeing either in Flash or in HDD? And a related question to that is, there's some worry that maybe a lot of memory inventory might be built again this quarter from the likes of some OEMs like Apple because they want to maximize their favorable component pricing? So, do you think this could lead to a further elongation in the recovery of the market, even though in the near-term it might get a little bit tighter? So, just your thoughts on that? And what exactly are you seeing in price elasticity?\nDavid Goeckeler: I think the elasticity in NAND is mainly what I was talking about. I mean, we're seeing PC OEM up mid-20s year-over-year on capacity. I think a really interesting number to me is the elasticity across our consumer franchise, which is tens \u2013 hundreds of millions of devices we sell a year in that channel up a third year-over-year on capacity per unit.  Gaming up more than that, and mobile up even more than that. So, I think we're seeing the market work. Even in the midst of a great downturn, you expect \u2013 well, especially in the midst of a great downturn, you expect to see elasticity start to kick in, and we are starting to see that across the portfolio. What was the second part of the question, again?\nUnidentified Analyst: It was about a customer [indiscernible].\nDavid Goeckeler: Prebuying. Yes. I think you do see \u2013 I think we are seeing instances of that. I wouldn't say it's pervasive, but we see instances of it. And I think it \u2013 I think maybe it's a sign of where the customers think we are in the cycle as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. So, for my follow-up, if I can ask a quick one to Wissam, how are you thinking about free cash flow going forward? I mean is it \u2013 what needs to happen to get to positive free cash flow? And is that possible in this calendar year? So, just your thoughts on that? I mean, how are you looking at working capital and thinking about free cash flow? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, [real close] [ph]. So, we are totally focused on free cash flow. As you've seen us since the beginning of the year, we've been very proactive on OpEx, reducing that quite a bit on CapEx, as well as taking underutilization to manage and preserve our cash and not build inventory. And so, this is very important to us. In fact, we continue to make improvements. I mean, if you look at our CapEx trend, it's gone down quite a bit. This year, we'll probably be spending approximately if not even more than 35% below last year. With respect to the next few quarters, we typically do not guide for free cash flow. But what I could say is that this is, as I said, a top priority for us and is a big focus, as you would imagine, as we navigate the dynamic environment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for all the detail. Appreciate.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTom O'Malley: Hi, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my question. My first one is related to the HDD side of the business. Your competitor recently talked about a recovery that initially was expected to be in June and is now pushed out to the December quarter. Could you just frame the way that you're thinking about the recovery? Is it kind of in-line with that? You're obviously guiding the HDD business down, but any color you could give on the back half of the calendar year about when you expect that business to recover?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think, Tom, it's \u2013 I would say as we go through the second half of the year, it will get better. The issue is that these revenue levels and these unit levels, it's just very lumpy. You have very large customers that if they buy or not buy, it can impact the TAM and the available market in a very significant way. So \u2013 and that's what we're experiencing next quarter. I mean, this quarter, we saw things were a little better than we thought on capacity enterprise shipments. We'll see a sequential decline in that, and then we're expecting to go back up as we go in the second half of the year. But I expect it to be lumpy as we go through this inventory digestion because a lot like we saw in the PC OEM space, a lot of customers are just completely focused on inventory digestion, which is basically new purchases just go to zero. And customers at this scale with this, kind of business that has an impact. So, I expect to see a lumpiness over the next several quarters. I do have a level of optimism about China in the second half of the year. We're seeing better activity there. And so, we expect to see that improve in the second half of the year as well, which should also help the business.\nTom O'Malley: Helpful. And then just a follow-up is on the Flash side. You guys talked about a mix of customer behavior, right, where some are still consuming inventory and then others are more aggressively purchasing to various degrees. I don't want you to speak on specific customers, but we've heard this across the ecosystem, particularly through this earnings period here where there is a discrepancy in terms of spend.  Could you help maybe just frame where you're seeing that spend? Is there a certain type of customer that's spending more than others or is it really just random where guys came in with certain inventory levels and are working through that? Just any color there would be really helpful as we've heard that data point from multiple companies here?\nDavid Goeckeler: I guess I would say that customers that are different segments of the market that are through their inventory digestion are now more or less shipping to end demand being lean on inventory. There are instances of people doing strategic buys in that \u2013 in some of those cases where they've got their inventory to where they want it, but now they're making their own \u2013 they have their own view of the cycle. That's a very small number, I would say. And then the other one is just \u2013 where they're at in their \u2013 the data center customers especially are just in \u2013 there's a variability of the level of inventory at each customer, and they're so big that it can impact the entire market. So \u2013 and like I said, ones that have heavy inventory are basically working that down in an aggressive way. And so, I think it's going to \u2013 like I said, I think it will be lumpy for a couple of quarters until we get through that.\nTom O'Malley: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. David, three months ago, you mentioned that you were cutting production in your NAND business by 30%. I'm curious if the magnitude of the cuts today are, kind of in that ZIP code, if anything has changed materially? And going forward, what would you need to see to start taking up your utilization rates in the Flash business?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We're kind of at the point where we're \u2013 I think it's \u2013 I think probably the same ZIP Code is probably a fair way to say depending on where you live, ZIP codes can be pretty big if you're in the country, I guess. But it's really about managing to where we see the demand and keeping our inventory relatively in check. We know it's going up somewhat, but we want to make sure it doesn't get away from us. So, we'll use the fab in that. I mean, we're just \u2013 we're going to have to see demand signals for our customers is just as simple as that. We have a very close relationship with a lot of them. We're in the \u2013 obviously, in the market every single day. A lot of these consumer and channel markets are more transactional, where we can see the business across a wide swath. And then, of course, we're talking to the biggest customers biggest technology companies in the world. So, we'll get a \u2013 we have a pretty good idea of where their demand is, and we'll set the fab appropriately to make sure that we keep the right inventory position and we have the product when they're ready.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then one follow-up for Wissam on the balance sheet side of things. I know you don't guide free cash flow on a quarterly basis or annual basis, but just curious how we should be thinking about inventory, whether it be dollars or days, going into the June quarter and working capital overall. Is that going to be a consumer of cash in the June quarter or do you think you can generate some cash from working capital? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Sure, Toshiya. With respect to inventory, the current projection is, I would say, flattish in terms of dollar, but in terms of days, I anticipate we should see a downtick from here. Well, we continue to, as David said, manage it on a very, very regular basis very closely. And so, that's probably the biggest in terms of the working capital. That's the number that would be moving the most. Again, we don't guide the free cash flow, so I wouldn't want to make any more comments around working capital. But I think the answer on the inventory would be a good indicator to what working capital will look.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The market share numbers are out for last year, you guys drove a strong number 2 position in client SSD, strong double-digit sort of percentage share position, right? But in enterprise, you guys drove, sort of low single-digit enterprise SSD market share last year, and it\u2019s sort of hovered in this 4% to 7% range for a while now, like what is the team doing to try and drive its share in this fast-growing market to more of what I would call appropriate, sort of double-digit percentage share profile?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Always good to hear from you. We've talked about this quite a bit over the last year. It's about qualifying the products at the big players, qualified in the channel. We just qualified this last quarter on BiCS5 enterprise SSD with some of the biggest customers. So, the road map is moving forward as we expected. It's just a very dynamic market right now. So, it's difficult to judge share. Obviously, our goal is what we've put out there is to drive that higher. And I have every confidence we'll do that as the market stabilizes and some of these big customers get back to their normal rates of purchasing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, thank you. I have a question on the cost side, Wissam. So, it's a little tricky to figure out given all the, I guess, one-time charges. I'm just wondering, you previously talked about NAND cost declines in the mid-teens, I believe, just wondering if you're tracking to that. And then as we go to BiCS8, how should we think about the cost declines, especially \u2013 I guess, historically, we've had 30% to 40% bit demand growth. And going forward, if that dynamic changes, if it's lower than 30%, do you think we can still, kind of get to that mid-teens cost declines or do you need the 30% to get to that level?\nWissam Jabre: Sure. So, thanks for the question. In terms of Q3, we have to think of it basically with and without underutilization. When you factor in the entry underutilization charges, we wouldn't be \u2013 we wouldn't have reduced cost or cost income down by mid-teens. However, if we exclude that, then we're close to mid-teens in Q3.  Now, to your question on BiCS8. I mean this is \u2013 with the way our road map works and the timing of when BiCS8 starts ramping, it is pretty much designed in a way to allow us to continue that mid-teens reduction \u2013 cost reduction over time. I wouldn't want to comment about the exact sort of percentage and so on in terms of the crossover because I think it's a little bit premature to talk about this. But conceptually, that's what we're aiming with ramping BiCS8 slightly earlier than previously anticipated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss the trajectory of exabyte demand of your cloud customers in the next couple of quarters? And whether there's a divergence and a recovery across on-prem and public cloud? And I guess as you address that question, how do you assess whether you might be shipping below normalized replacement demand? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: I think we see the enterprise and the cloud market. They're both soft right now. So, we don't see a huge difference between the two. Again, the difference is, Karl, that you got this idiosyncratic behavior at really big customers. So, a customer that usually buys a significant amount of hard drives in a quarter, hundreds of millions of dollars goes to zero. You can pretty much assume they're buying under replacement demand. So, that's kind of where we're at. We just \u2013 again, other customers are going along more according to plan. So, the inventory level is a bit distributed across big customers. So, we look at this quite a bit to understand like where do we think the exabyte growth is and where are we setting the \u2013 our long-term production capabilities and all of that. But right now, it's just a little difficult to draw long-term conclusions and some of \u2013 a little bit behind some of your question, given just the way the market is \u2013 the lumpiness of the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVijay Rakesh: Hi. Just a quick question. I don't know if you talked about Elliott strategies, and I think they had filed some \u2013 they had some filings, but just wondering how that process is progressing? I don't know if you can talk to it.\nDavid Goeckeler: It's progressing. Very active. Everybody in it is under NDA, so I can't say anything about it, and we look forward to talking about it when we reach a conclusion.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Maybe for Wissam. I might have missed it, but just wondering if there's any context you can provide about how you're thinking about the debt due in February of 2024? How you're going to handle that, go back handling that? Thanks.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, Ananda. With respect to the 1.1 billion of convert due in February 2024, the plan is to address it over the next couple of quarters.\nPeter Andrew: Okay. Jason, is that the last one?\nOperator: Yes, that was the last question.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you through the quarter. Take care.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 third quarter results. Western Digital's third quarter performance exceeded expectations with core metrics at the high-end of our guidance range, demonstrating the company's resilience in a challenging market environment. We reported third quarter revenue of 2.8 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 11% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.37. Over the last several years, our team is focused on enhancing business agility and delivering a range of innovative industry leading products that address the increasing data storage demands of our customers. The groundwork we laid combined with the actions we have taken since the beginning of this fiscal year to right size and refocus our business have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment. I am pleased that we delivered non-GAAP gross margin at the higher-end of our guidance range due to strong execution across both our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, our early actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and focus our product offerings on delivering the best value for our data center customers have resulted in gross margin upside and profitable market share gains in HDD. In Flash, our broad go to market strategy anchored on our enviable retail franchise in a strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to optimize bid placement and bolster gross margin. During the fiscal third quarter, we saw signs of demand stabilizing across various end markets. In consumer, Our flash and HD results were consistent with the expectations we shared in January. In client, demand for each major product area came in better than we expected across PC OEM, channel, mobile and gaming. In cloud, demand for capacity enterprise hard drives improved whereas the demand for flash drives was consistent with our expectations set in January. Before I jump into updates on our HDD and Flash businesses, I would like to reiterate that the strategic review process is ongoing and we will provide updates as we have them. I'll now turn to the business update starting with HDD. During the fiscal third quarter, our HDD revenue improved sequentially with growth in capacity enterprise offsetting seasonal declines in retail and client. During the quarter, our 22 terabyte CMR drive became the highest volume product among all of our 20 terabyte and above capacity points. Demonstrating our leadership position at this capacity point. In addition, we expect the complete qualification of our 26 terabyte Ultra SMR technology in the fiscal fourth quarter. These innovative products provide multi-generation benefits to our customers. Turning to Flash, total exabyte shipment came in higher than expected in consumer, mobile, PC OEM, and channel products. Despite the industry experiencing the worst downturn in over a decade, Western Digital delivered positive product gross margin, excluding underutilization charges, driven by our unique combination of premium retail brands, broad go to market channels, and low cost flash supply from our joint venture fab with Kioxia. Furthermore, we continue to see encouraging signs of price elasticity driven content growth in retail flash led by WD Black, SSD optimized for gaming, as well as mobile PC OEMs and channel within client. On the technology front, BiCS6 achieved its anticipated cost crossover during the quarter. Moreover, on March 30, Western Digital and Kioxia announced our next generation BiCS8 node, a groundbreaking technology that builds upon the success of BiCS5 and BiCS6. This new technology is based on circuit bonded to array architecture, which provides several benefits, including reduced cycle time faster yield ramp, better or lateral scaling, and industry leading IO performance when compared to products based on circuit under array architecture. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 for a broad range of applications, which will position Western Digital for success as business conditions improve. As we look to the fiscal fourth quarter, in hard drives, overall demand will be impacted by ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers and a sustained decline in client. However, we are beginning to experience improved demand at certain customers in China. In Flash, we are seeing signs of stabilization and content increase per unit. PC OEMs have emerged from inventory digest and are now shipping closer to end demand. Gaming will remain strong, while enterprise SSD for cloud applications will remain soft. We anticipate modest growth in bit shipments into the fiscal fourth quarter. Before I hand the call over to Wissam, I would like to thank the Western Digital team for the response efforts they made in addressing the network security incident we disclosed on April 2nd. Our team took proactive and precautionary measures to secure our operations and successfully executed on our business continuity plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam. Thanks, Wissam. Over the past few quarters, we have successfully ramped a series of industry-leading storage products and commercialized innovative technologies, while concurrently rightsizing our cost structure. Our proactive actions have positioned Western Digital favorably for the future as demand gradually returns to normal levels. In closing, I would like to thank our team members for their unwavering commitment in advancing innovative products and driving operational efficiency. Their exceptional efforts have allowed Western Digital to deliver in [Technical Difficulty] to the dedication and support of our people worldwide, and we remain committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all that we do. Okay. I look forward to your questions. Let's open it up. Inventory correction there is mostly behind us. Our channel business performed really well this past quarter, I think, above what our expectation was. The inventory issue is still very much in data center and it's very lumpy. We have some big cloud customers that are consuming. We have others that are really in a full inventory digestion and aren't taking anything. So that market is still where we see a lot of inventory digestion going on. And I expect that to be lumpy for the next couple of quarters. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in China. We talked about that. I think it's setting up for recovery in the second half of the year, a lot more activity around RFPs and discussions about what demand is going to look like the second half. So, that's a bit \u2013 an overview of where we see the market. I think on your numbers, you're probably down a little more than we are on HDD. I think that's probably more a single-digit kind of number on a sequential basis. Yes. Well, let's talk about for each business. I mean, I think in HDD and I'm sure Wissam will have a little bit to add here as well. HDD, which is the smaller part of the number, but still significant we're going to see a drop in volume next quarter. So, we'll see some underutilization there. On the Flash side, we continue to underutilize the fab. We're managing it in a very dynamic way, kind of week-to-week month-to-month to make sure we've fully understand demand and keep our inventory in a position where we want it. And so \u2013 but we will definitely see underutilization on both sides of the business next quarter. Thanks, C.J. So, Joe with respect to our LCM charges, we do it at the finished good product level. It is not pulled. Those are typically allowed to be added back per our credit agreement to the EBITDA. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Yes, I mean, I think there's always price pressure in this market Aaron, but we've been very disciplined about the value of our products. I think you \u2013 one of the things we feel very good about is, we've been investing in our HDD roadmap, things like OptiNAND, ePMR, UltraSMR, these products are really now starting to ship in volume. We talked about the 22-terabyte CMR drive was the highest volume drive at 20 and above. So, we feel very good about where the portfolio is, about where it's going. We've got a number of very large customers qualifying SMR right now. That's clearly the next step in the data center, our UltraSMR product there, the 2016, we talked about we'll finish up calls this quarter and start deploying next quarter. So, we feel like we've got a portfolio that is aligned with what the market needs. And that's showing up in, kind of how we're able to monetize that portfolio and not have to compete on price. So, future technologies like HAMR will be there. We're still are ways away before that product is going to be a volume type product. The volume products are the 22s going and then SMR are going to be the big volume products over the next couple of years and after that we'll get to HAMR. We feel confident about that technology. It's been in development for a long time. We're in the final stages of it as an industry and I think everybody is excited that it will be the roadmap for 30 and above when we need it. Yes, we've been very transparent about that incident. When we noticed it, we let folks know, we took our \u2013 we basically disconnected ourselves from the public Internet to protect ourselves and then restore the environment. We still have capabilities inside the companies and the factories were operational throughout that. Clearly, a tremendous amount of work by the team, but we feel like we're nearly all the way back now as far as operation. We got to bring the store online in here in another week or so, but it was really, really good to see our business continuity plans, you don't want to rely on them too often, but when we had two, they were there and they kept the company moving forward. I would say, we have \u2013 I mean obviously we have very robust conversations with our customers all the time. I wouldn't pin the tone of conversations on to how any one particular player in the market is acting or what they're doing. We stay very focused on our business. As far as where is the bottom, I mean we expect the market to come into balance as we go through the second half of the year. I think we're clearly taking a lot of actions in our own business to closely manage it, supply and demand. Keep the utilization of the fab close to where demand is. So, we manage our inventory. Clearly, we're going through one of the most severe downturns in a while, but we think as we move through the second half of the year the market will come into balance. We're doing analysis on that, Mehdi. What I would say is, to me \u2013 I'll even go a little longer-term, bigger picture. This just reinforces the value of stored data. I think that it just seems like there's this constant ways for people can figure out how to use all the data they've stored to do very productive things with it. And I think the latest is training these AI engines. And so, we just think it's another element of the long-term value of data storage and it's just a big secular tailwind for the HDD business and the enterprise SSD business. I mean, again, you know that they're both \u2013 they both have big TAMs in the data center, and they're both growing. And we think this is another reason why people will store more data is because they can monetize it in different ways in the future. I think it will \u2013 HDD is the lion's share of storage in the cloud. So, you would expect that's where the bigger lift would be across those two technologies. Thanks Mehdi. It's good to talk to you as always. Yes. We've been very \u2013 obviously, we've been \u2013 one of the things we've been building into the business over the last several years as we've restructured the business is more agility and the ability to proactively respond to the market we're in. I think that's kind of the hallmark of the organization we're trying to build is agile and dynamic. But clearly, on top of that, Shannon, we went to a business unit structure for a reason. It's because we have two very, very focused organizations with very sophisticated leaders in them that is constantly doing the ROI analysis of where we put our OpEx, and we get the most out of it. And I think quite frankly, that's led to the portfolio we have today. I think we have the best portfolio we've ever had. And that's an effort that goes on constantly, continuously. And so, as we continue to draw down OpEx to resize the business to the realities of what the market is. We've built the capability over the last couple of years to do that in a way where we can make sure we're going to get \u2013 first of all, the OpEx we spend, we get the best ROI out of it, the best return and that we make sure that we're making \u2013 we're taking actions to the business that don't harm the long-term value of it, and we make the right decision on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month basis. So, I think this is really a capability we've built in the last three years, and I think it's serving us well right now to make sure that we're not cutting in ways that are going to impact the long-term health of the business. So, I'll make a few comments. I suspect Wissam will have a few comments as well. I mean this is \u2013 there's been a lot of focus on this in the last year of how do we become more efficient, how do we automate more. Several of our factories have won World Economic Forum Lighthouse awards for automation. How do we rescale our employees? And how do we just \u2013 we've been very focused on driving a level of automation, driving productivity, and just lowering our fixed cost asset base in the HDD business. And I think our fixed \u2013 I don't think I know, our fixed costs in that business are now the lowest they've been in well over a decade. So, I think that's paying off in the way we're able to generate margin in the business at lower volume levels. And then as the volume starts to pick back up, we've got capacity to meet what the market needs, and I think we'll do that at a much lower cost basis. Thanks, Shannon. Appreciate it. Yes. I think on pricing, it's kind of the same story all the time, right? Whether it's a down market, upmarket, mid-cycle market, which is really have a diverse portfolio. We've talked about this a lot from retail to the channel business, PC OEMs, enterprise SSD gaming has become a very nice part of the portfolio and growing part of the portfolio. And it's just that \u2013 mobile, obviously, is a big part of our portfolio. And it's just been mixing across that where we get the best return, right, putting our supply and our bits in the places where we can get the best return. I do think that, that is a \u2013 that go to \u2013 that breadth of go-to-market is in markets that we can reach literally from every single consumer to the largest technology companies in the world and kind of everything in between. And just the ability to mix across that with a strong portfolio and a strong set of brands as well, SanDisk, SanDisk Professional, WD_BLACK, puts us in a good position to get the best return on our supply. Next quarter, we don't really want to comment on future pricing. It's all into the guide. We've talked about the individual markets. What I would say is, we're pricing in or we're putting in what we think is going to do on an individual market-by-market basis and then how we'll mix that next quarter. I think that's our focus \u2013 on a CMR drive, that's our focused capacity point and it's significantly ahead of other CMR drives above 20. So \u2013 or above the 20 terabyte drive. We expect that to be our premier drive for the next \u2013 until we have a different CMR product in that part of the business. So, we expect that to be a very good growth engine, and we've talked a lot about that drive of \u2013 it provides a lot of value. It provides a lot of TCO value for our customers. And we \u2013 it contributes an appropriate amount of margin from that perspective as well. Thank you. I think the elasticity in NAND is mainly what I was talking about. I mean, we're seeing PC OEM up mid-20s year-over-year on capacity. I think a really interesting number to me is the elasticity across our consumer franchise, which is tens \u2013 hundreds of millions of devices we sell a year in that channel up a third year-over-year on capacity per unit.  Gaming up more than that, and mobile up even more than that. So, I think we're seeing the market work. Even in the midst of a great downturn, you expect \u2013 well, especially in the midst of a great downturn, you expect to see elasticity start to kick in, and we are starting to see that across the portfolio. What was the second part of the question, again? Prebuying. Yes. I think you do see \u2013 I think we are seeing instances of that. I wouldn't say it's pervasive, but we see instances of it. And I think it \u2013 I think maybe it's a sign of where the customers think we are in the cycle as well. Thank you. Yes. I think, Tom, it's \u2013 I would say as we go through the second half of the year, it will get better. The issue is that these revenue levels and these unit levels, it's just very lumpy. You have very large customers that if they buy or not buy, it can impact the TAM and the available market in a very significant way. So \u2013 and that's what we're experiencing next quarter. I mean, this quarter, we saw things were a little better than we thought on capacity enterprise shipments. We'll see a sequential decline in that, and then we're expecting to go back up as we go in the second half of the year. But I expect it to be lumpy as we go through this inventory digestion because a lot like we saw in the PC OEM space, a lot of customers are just completely focused on inventory digestion, which is basically new purchases just go to zero. And customers at this scale with this, kind of business that has an impact. So, I expect to see a lumpiness over the next several quarters. I do have a level of optimism about China in the second half of the year. We're seeing better activity there. And so, we expect to see that improve in the second half of the year as well, which should also help the business. I guess I would say that customers that are different segments of the market that are through their inventory digestion are now more or less shipping to end demand being lean on inventory. There are instances of people doing strategic buys in that \u2013 in some of those cases where they've got their inventory to where they want it, but now they're making their own \u2013 they have their own view of the cycle. That's a very small number, I would say. And then the other one is just \u2013 where they're at in their \u2013 the data center customers especially are just in \u2013 there's a variability of the level of inventory at each customer, and they're so big that it can impact the entire market. So \u2013 and like I said, ones that have heavy inventory are basically working that down in an aggressive way. And so, I think it's going to \u2013 like I said, I think it will be lumpy for a couple of quarters until we get through that. Thanks, Tom. Yes. We're kind of at the point where we're \u2013 I think it's \u2013 I think probably the same ZIP Code is probably a fair way to say depending on where you live, ZIP codes can be pretty big if you're in the country, I guess. But it's really about managing to where we see the demand and keeping our inventory relatively in check. We know it's going up somewhat, but we want to make sure it doesn't get away from us. So, we'll use the fab in that. I mean, we're just \u2013 we're going to have to see demand signals for our customers is just as simple as that. We have a very close relationship with a lot of them. We're in the \u2013 obviously, in the market every single day. A lot of these consumer and channel markets are more transactional, where we can see the business across a wide swath. And then, of course, we're talking to the biggest customers biggest technology companies in the world. So, we'll get a \u2013 we have a pretty good idea of where their demand is, and we'll set the fab appropriately to make sure that we keep the right inventory position and we have the product when they're ready. Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Always good to hear from you. We've talked about this quite a bit over the last year. It's about qualifying the products at the big players, qualified in the channel. We just qualified this last quarter on BiCS5 enterprise SSD with some of the biggest customers. So, the road map is moving forward as we expected. It's just a very dynamic market right now. So, it's difficult to judge share. Obviously, our goal is what we've put out there is to drive that higher. And I have every confidence we'll do that as the market stabilizes and some of these big customers get back to their normal rates of purchasing. I think we see the enterprise and the cloud market. They're both soft right now. So, we don't see a huge difference between the two. Again, the difference is, Karl, that you got this idiosyncratic behavior at really big customers. So, a customer that usually buys a significant amount of hard drives in a quarter, hundreds of millions of dollars goes to zero. You can pretty much assume they're buying under replacement demand. So, that's kind of where we're at. We just \u2013 again, other customers are going along more according to plan. So, the inventory level is a bit distributed across big customers. So, we look at this quite a bit to understand like where do we think the exabyte growth is and where are we setting the \u2013 our long-term production capabilities and all of that. But right now, it's just a little difficult to draw long-term conclusions and some of \u2013 a little bit behind some of your question, given just the way the market is \u2013 the lumpiness of the market. It's progressing. Very active. Everybody in it is under NDA, so I can't say anything about it, and we look forward to talking about it when we reach a conclusion. All right, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you through the quarter. Take care."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results reflected the challenging market environment with continued pressure on revenue and profitability. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, down 10% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.37. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 43% of total revenue at 1.2 billion, down 2% sequentially, driven by an increase in capacity enterprise drive shipments, which was offset by a decrease in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 79 exabytes, up 31% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue declined 32%, primarily due to a decline in shipments of both hard drive and flash products, as well as price decreases in Flash. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 10% sequentially and 44% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decrease was driven by price declines across our flash products and lower client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC application. Finally, consumer represented 22% of total revenue at 0.6 billion, down 22% sequentially, and 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was due to a seasonal decline in shipments of both retail hard drive and flash products, as well as price declines in retail flash. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and price declines in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. HDD revenue was 1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased [50%]] and average price per hard drive increased 10% to $109. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 23%, and average price per unit increased 9%. Flash revenue was 1.3 billion, down 21% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 10% on a blended basis and 12% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses, please note that my comments would be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 10.6%, down 6.8 percentage points sequentially and 21.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $275 million of charges for manufacturing underutilization, inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was higher than anticipated at 24.3%, up 3.6 percentage points sequentially and down 3.4 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher capacity enterprise volume, as well as lower manufacturing costs and underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were less than projected at approximately $40 million or 2.7 percentage points, partially benefiting from the actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and offsetting other charges of $22 million. Flash gross margin was negative 5%, down 19.5 percentage points sequentially, and 40.6 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges associated with the reduced manufacturing volumes were approximately $160 million or 12.2 percentage points, less than expected as we focused on lowering manufacturing costs. During the quarter, we incurred $53 million of flash inventory write-down charges resulting from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were at $602 million for the quarter, down 57 million sequentially and 138 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $304 million, driven by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling 275 million. Income tax expense was $60 million. Despite a consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal third quarter loss per share was $1.37, inclusive of a $9 million dividend cost associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was an out flow of 381 million and free cash flow was an outflow of 527 million. Cash, capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement was $146 million. Gross debt outstanding was 7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement was 2.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.8x, compared to 2.1x in the fiscal second quarter. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation addback associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.  At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $5.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of 2.2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of 2.25 billion, and unused delayed draw term loan facility of 875 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. We expect HDD revenue to decrease sequentially, due to ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers. We expect Flash revenue to decrease sequentially as modest growth in bit shipments is more than offset by ASP declines. We expect Flash bit shipment growth to accelerate in the first half of fiscal year 2024. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin will be negatively impacted by underutilization charges and Flash pricing. We continue to tightly manage our cost structures through this dynamic environment and expect operating expenses to be below $600 million.  For fiscal year 2023, we project gross capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion, and cash capital expenditures to be approximately 0.8 billion. The projected cash capital expenditures represent more than a 50% reduction from our forecast as we entered fiscal year 2023 and approximately 35% reduction from fiscal year 2022. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 3% and 5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $220 million to $240 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $580 million to $600 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately 90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $60 million and $70 million. We expect loss per share of $2.20 to $1.90, assuming approximately 321 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David. And just to add \u2013 C.J., sorry, just to add a bit more color, I think we \u2013 in our guide, we're estimating around [220 to 240] [ph], the range of underutilization charges. And by business, this is roughly two-thirds Flash, one-thirds HDD or one-third [SSD] [ph]. Thanks Joe. So Aaron, we typically factor into our guidance all the expectations. And when we exited Q3, like a typical quarter, we do our reserve reviews and we take the \u2013 we make sure that the balance sheet properly stated. And so based on our forecast, everything is baked into the guidance. Typically, we have a small amount in the guidance just like we did also in the past quarter. Sorry, Sidney. I just wanted to add that for fiscal Q3, we don't have any impact in the numbers to the network security. Yes, we typically don't break that out as much on the call. This is a bit too much detail, Mehdi, for me to discuss here. The one comment I would make though, when we think of inventory, our operations team is really focused on minimizing where we can. So, we basically try to stage it in the places that makes the most sense from a demand perspective. I mean, the inventory write-down typically is, it's really based \u2013 the ones that was, for instance, I called out is based on basically the inventory value relative to where the market price is. And so, if \u2013 when prices decline by a lot, then we do have to take a closer look and see if there's any impact, but that's what I would say about that. What I'm saying is, we \u2013 what I'm saying is, at the end of every quarter our balance sheet is properly stated because we do look at where the inventory value is versus where the demand is and the prices are most particularly at the finished good level. And so, where we see differences we have to adjust our inventory value, otherwise it is properly stated. I guess your question is more around trying to predict where the price is going and we typically don't necessarily do that. Yes. I mean the one thing I would add also, in addition to what David said, some of the activities that we drive in terms of the manufacturing side are taken back into the development organizations to think about things that come on platforms and the ability to improve on the way our products are designed for manufacturing efficiency, even increasing manufacturing efficiency going forward. And of course, with that comes a better cost structure. Yes, [real close] [ph]. So, we are totally focused on free cash flow. As you've seen us since the beginning of the year, we've been very proactive on OpEx, reducing that quite a bit on CapEx, as well as taking underutilization to manage and preserve our cash and not build inventory. And so, this is very important to us. In fact, we continue to make improvements. I mean, if you look at our CapEx trend, it's gone down quite a bit. This year, we'll probably be spending approximately if not even more than 35% below last year. With respect to the next few quarters, we typically do not guide for free cash flow. But what I could say is that this is, as I said, a top priority for us and is a big focus, as you would imagine, as we navigate the dynamic environment. Thank you. Sure, Toshiya. With respect to inventory, the current projection is, I would say, flattish in terms of dollar, but in terms of days, I anticipate we should see a downtick from here. Well, we continue to, as David said, manage it on a very, very regular basis very closely. And so, that's probably the biggest in terms of the working capital. That's the number that would be moving the most. Again, we don't guide the free cash flow, so I wouldn't want to make any more comments around working capital. But I think the answer on the inventory would be a good indicator to what working capital will look. Sure. So, thanks for the question. In terms of Q3, we have to think of it basically with and without underutilization. When you factor in the entry underutilization charges, we wouldn't be \u2013 we wouldn't have reduced cost or cost income down by mid-teens. However, if we exclude that, then we're close to mid-teens in Q3.  Now, to your question on BiCS8. I mean this is \u2013 with the way our road map works and the timing of when BiCS8 starts ramping, it is pretty much designed in a way to allow us to continue that mid-teens reduction \u2013 cost reduction over time. I wouldn't want to comment about the exact sort of percentage and so on in terms of the crossover because I think it's a little bit premature to talk about this. But conceptually, that's what we're aiming with ramping BiCS8 slightly earlier than previously anticipated. Yes, Ananda. With respect to the 1.1 billion of convert due in February 2024, the plan is to address it over the next couple of quarters."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded.  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 second quarter results. The Western Digital team worked diligently within a dynamic market and delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range we provided in October. We reported second quarter revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million. Our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Our ongoing efforts to control expenses, optimize working capital and deploy capital judiciously helped us manage cash flow amidst a challenging flash pricing environment and larger-than-expected ACD underutilization that pressured gross margins.  Before we discuss the details of our second quarter results, I wanted to cover two other announcements that we are making today. First, we disclosed that Western Digital has entered into agreements with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for convertible preferred equity investments totaling $900 million. In connection with the agreement, Reed Raymond, a partner at Apollo, will join our Board starting immediately. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to welcome Reed, a leading technology investor who will provide us with additional financial and strategic expertise, which will be critical as we continue to execute on our business strategy and complete our strategic review. Second, on January 25, we secured access to $875 million of financing through a delayed draw term loan. When combined with the actions we undertook to structurally lower our cost structure, these financings provide valuable financial optionality and flexibility to Western Digital as we continue our strategic review. Regardless of the outcome of the strategic review, our goal is to ensure the business is in a solid financial position to invest in innovation and create long-term shareholder value. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review process or making comments on market rumors. We will provide updates as we have them. Over the past three years, we have worked continuously to reinvigorate innovation and bolster business agility for both our flash and HDD organizations, which enabled the Western Digital team to stay ahead of the market. Over the same period, we paid down $2.7 billion in debt and arranged for settlement of a long-standing tax dispute. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, we have taken additional actions to reset the business in response to the post-pandemic environment. These actions include: first, we have further reduced our capital expenditures across Flash and HDD to moderate our supply. As a result, our projected cash capital expenditure for fiscal 2023 has declined nearly 40% from six months ago. Second, we have decreased supply bid growth across both Flash and HDD. In Flash, we reduced wafer starts by 30% in January. In HDD, during the fiscal first quarter, we consolidated production lines across our manufacturing facilities and idled certain media production lines in Asia, reducing client hard drive capacity by approximately 40%. During the fiscal second quarter, we continued to optimize our capacity enterprise manufacturing footprint to align our supply with the new demand environment. Third, we have reduced our quarterly non-GAAP operating expense by over $100 million since the close of fiscal year 2022, driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and variable compensation. We are targeting to reduce quarterly non-GAAP operating expense level to below $600 million by the time we exit the fiscal year. And lastly, in December, we successfully executed an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreement. Turning to end market demand during the fiscal second quarter. Demand for consumer-oriented products stabilized as we discussed in October. In Consumer, we experienced a seasonal uptick across both Flash and HDD. In client, channel demand for both SSD and HDD have improved. However, commercial PCs are now being impacted by tightening budgets and spending across corporations, which is negatively affecting client SSD shipments. In cloud, we experienced a decline in nearline shipments as our customers were undergoing inventory digestion and ongoing subdued China demand. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. During the fiscal second quarter, our HDD revenue declined significantly as cloud inventory digestion intensified, while demand for retail and client HDD improved.  We continue to successfully execute on our product road map as we completed qualifications and commenced shipments of our latest generation 22-terabyte CMR hard drives at multiple cloud and major OEM customers last quarter. We are aggressively ramping this 22 terabyte CMR product this quarter and expect this drive along with its SMR variants to be our growth engine going forward. Qualifications of our 26 terabyte UltraSMR drives are also progressing well. Our major customers remain committed to adopting SMR drives as the 20% capacity gain that UltraSMR drives over CMR offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide. We expect sequential growth in revenue and margin into our fiscal third quarter and continued recovery as we move through calendar year 2023. Turning to Flash. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading retail franchise combined with strong seasonal demand, bit shipments increased 20% sequentially, exceeding our forecast.  While we continue to experience pricing pressure in the market, our premium brands, including SanDisk, SanDisk Professional and WD_BLACK continued to deliver strong share and profitability to support the business. Our premium WD_BLACK client SSD, which is optimized for gaming continues to be well received in the marketplace. It achieved a record exabyte shipments, unit shipments and average capacity per drive resulting in exabyte shipment increase of 73% sequentially and 41% year-over-year for this product. On the technology front, BiCS5 represented 70% of our flash revenue in the December quarter, while BiCS6 will reach cost crossover in the fiscal third quarter. Our next-generation 3D NAND node BiCS8 has entered productization phase. BiCS8 incorporates several groundbreaking 3D NAND architectural innovations to deliver a major leap in performance and cost-effective solutions to a broad range of exciting products, demonstrating the benefits of Western Digital's strong partnership with Kioxia and our innovation leadership in 3D NAND architecture. As we look into the fiscal third quarter, in hard drives, overall demand in cloud has stabilized, and we expect modest improvement in near line to offset a seasonal decline in client and consumer hard drives. We expect stronger improvements in the second half of this calendar year, led by the aggressive ramp of our 22 and 26 terabyte hard drives. In flash, we expect enterprise SSD product demand for the fiscal third quarter to be sharply reduced as certain large cloud customers have entered a digestion period. In addition, a reduction in commercial PC demand is expected to impact client SSD shipments in the near term. Driven by the lower customer demand forecast in enterprise and client SSDs, we anticipate bit shipments to decline in the fiscal third quarter and return to growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Western Digital lowered wafer starts in January, and we remain flexible in adjusting the magnitude and duration to restore our flash supply and demand balance. As noted, for calendar year 2023, we expect reduced capital investment and lower utilization in response to the new demand environment. Our initial estimate is for flash demand bit growth to be in the low 20% range with production bit growth to be well below that of demand.  With that, let me turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our second quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the third quarter.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, down 17% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 39% of revenue at $1.2 billion, down 33% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Sequentially, the declines in capacity enterprise drives sold to our cloud customers and smart videos were partly offset by an increase in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 61 exabytes, down sequentially, driven by inventory digestion. The year-over-year decline was also primarily due to inventory digestion in hard drives. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 11% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was driven by pricing pressure across our Flash products, which was partly offset by an increase in hard drive shipments. The year-over-year decline was also due to pricing pressure in Flash as well as lower client SSD shipments for PC applications. Finally, consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by a seasonal uptick in both retail hard drives and Flash shipments. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and pricing pressure in Flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $1.5 billion down 28% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 35% and average price per hard drive decreased 21% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 33%, and average price per unit increased 2%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 4% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 20% on a blended basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 20% sequentially and remained approximately flat year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 17.4%, down 9.3 percentage points sequentially and 16.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 7.8 percentage points sequentially and 9.9 percentage points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decline was due to underutilization related charges of approximately $100 million. Our Flash gross margin was 14.5%, down 10 percentage points sequentially and 21.6 percentage points year-over-year. We are continuing to reduce our costs with operating expenses at $659 million for the quarter, down $30 million sequentially. Operating loss was $119 million. Taxes were a benefit of $48 million. Taxes are influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was a loss of $0.42. operating cash flow for the second quarter was $35 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $240 million. Cash capital expenditure which includes the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was $275 million.  Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.3 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.1 times compared to 1.5 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.8 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. As David mentioned, during the fiscal second quarter, we executed an amendment to the credit agreement that temporarily increased the covenant leverage ratio for the next seven quarters. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a revolver capacity of $2.25 billion for total liquidity of $4.1 billion. Today, we announced multiple agreements to further enhance our liquidity position by $1.8 billion as follows.  On January 25, we closed the delayed draw term loan agreement with our lenders in the amount of $875 million. In addition, as David mentioned, Western Digital entered into an agreement with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for a convertible preferred investment of $900 million.  Together, these actions significantly increase our ability to access liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility and optionality as we manage through this challenging downturn and execute on our strategic review. Before I go over guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook and the financial impact associated with the actions we are taking to rightsize our cost structure.  In HDD, we expect revenue to increase modestly in the fiscal third quarter as growth in nearline shipments outpaces decline in consumer. In Flash, we expect both shipments and ASP to decrease sequentially. We expect bit growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to approximately $2.3 billion compared to our prior forecast of $3.2 billion entering this fiscal year. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure to $900 million which is about 40% below our forecast six months ago. The primary drivers of our lower capital expenditures are the delay of the BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investment levels in both client and capacity enterprise hard drive manufacturing.  We have reduced our quarterly operating expenses by over $100 million compared to six months ago. We are targeting to exit this fiscal year with quarterly operating expenses below $600 million. These actions will allow us to weather this cycle while also enabling us to continue advancing our innovative product road map going forward. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 9% and 11%, which includes underutilization charges in Flash and HDD totaling $250 million, with Flash driven by a 30% reduction in wafer starts.  We expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect tax expenses to be between $60 million and $70 million for the fiscal third quarter and approximately $240 million to $260 million for the fiscal year. We expect loss per share of $1.70 to $1.40 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 319 million shares outstanding. I will now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Before we open up for questions, I wanted to reiterate our view of the long-term opportunities for both Flash and HDD storage. Importantly, our efforts have enabled us to regain architectural leadership in both Flash and HDD, and we are preparing these technologies to address the meaningful long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With our diverse portfolio, broad go-to-market engine, an enviable retail franchise and a lower cost structure, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. Okay. Peter, let's open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Obviously, we're kind of in a perfect storm here. But curious, as you think about maintaining your technological competitiveness in the NAND side, while at the same time, significantly slowing down CapEx for both you as well as what we've heard from Kioxia for BiCS6. I guess, how do you balance those two things? How do you set the stage into a recovery and maintaining that leadership? And how much longer can you squeeze the requisite kind of 15% cost down out of BiCS5.\nDavid Goeckeler: C.J., thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So yes, that's a balancing act. There's no doubt. I mean one of the things we talked about in the script and we feel really good about is BiCS8, I think BiCS8 has reached productization. We'll have more to say about BiCS8. Siva will do -- I think we'll do a webinar during the quarter on all the technological innovation there. There's been an enormous amount of R&D going into that. So, we feel very good about where we are from a technology road map. I'm actually in my hand right here I'm holding a BiCS8 USB, one of the first ones. And so, we're putting enough capital in the system to move BiCS6 along. I mean, BiCS6 will be a shorter node for us. It won't go into all products. We'll be making choices about what we take it into or where we need BiCS6, BiCS5 will serve us well for the rest of the portfolio, and then we'll move right into BiCS8, which quite frankly, is ahead of schedule as far as production, and we feel very good about it. So, we'll balance all of that and have enough capital to accelerate, have enough BiCS6 there that we need it and then accelerate BiCS8 when we see the growth come back. As far as the cost downs, look, I mean, in the second half of the year, cost downs are going to be very difficult because we are far along in BiCS5 and BiCS6 is not ramping that much. We'll return to those as we start to ramp BiCS8.  But we'll still have some, but not to the level, especially with the underutilization of fabs. So, all of those mixed in, we're going to -- we will have gotten most of our cost downs in the first half of the year, and then we'll see them come back as we ramp up BiCS6 and especially BiCS8.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. If I could follow up, Wissam, can you confirm that for the March quarter is just $150 million incremental underutilization charges? And then how are you thinking about that rolling off through calendar '23. Thank you so much.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. C.J., so the -- for the March quarter, we're projecting $250 million in total. That's between both Flash and HDD. We expect the probably, I would say, 3/4 of those to be in the Flash -- on the flash side and 1/4 in the HDD business. As we roll into the fourth quarter, I expect HDD to become minimal. But Flash will depend on how long we continue with the underutilization. The way to think of it is typically we -- as we under or as sort of we reduce the wafer starts, given the cycle time, we expect approximately 60% to 70% of the impact to come in the first, let's say, 90 days and then the remaining impact would be in the following quarter. So, the way to think of it is the March quarter would have around 60% to 70% of the impact from the underutilization for -- that we've taken -- the actions we've taken so far. Now that said, it could be that, depending on how the demand picture evolves, we haven't yet decided how long the underutilization is going to be, and we'll manage this in a very dynamic way as we continue to look at market inputs and so on. My comments were around assuming, let's say, a one-quarter event.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks for taking my question. I'll try to slip in two as well here real quick. First of all, on the 30% reduction of the wafer starts starting in early January. I'm just curious in the context of what you had outlined, you still -- it sounds like I think that NAND Flash bit demand growth is somewhere in the 20% plus range. With that 30% reduction, how has your bit production changed as you look at calendar '23, how much -- what's your assumption as far as your own bit supply growth as we move forward?\nDavid Goeckeler: So first of all, let me talk about the kind of how we're thinking about it. It is a very dynamic situation. I think when we were looking at our CQ1, we've seen some demand drops. We've come off a very strong quarter of bit growth. We just delivered 20% sequential bit growth. That's why we didn't cut wafers earlier. When we look at our fiscal Q3, we're seeing some drop in both client and enterprise. The enterprise SSD side of it is more a digestion issue. So, to make sure we manage our inventory and we don't get things to build up. And so that's why we're -- we've decided to cut wafer starts in the first quarter.  Again, as Wissam said, that's a -- it's literally a decision we can make every week about how do we load wafers into the fab. Right now, that's a one quarter decision to make sure we keep our supply and demand balanced as best we can. I see Wissam looking up -- do you have a number on the overall bit growth for the year.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. I think the -- from a supply perspective, I would say, it will be in the lower -- I would say, it's probably given the CapEx situation, we're looking at this to be in the single-digit growth from a supply perspective.\nAaron Rakers: That's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, on the hard disk drive side, I mean, looking at 61 exabyte capacity shift, that's down 40%, 45% sequential. What gives you the confidence that, that's just a transitory digestion thing? And maybe there isn't anything going on competitively? Just any kind of visibility you want to share in that business?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think we signaled this a little bit last quarter. We knew there was going to be some variability in demand across the industry and across customers. Quite frankly, when you're at these revenue levels, which are the lowest we've seen in the long time, orders from big customers make a very big difference.  So, if you go back for the last couple of quarters, the way different big cloud customers, the way either LTAs were restructured, the way big orders came in one way or another, you're seeing some pretty large share shifts quarter-over-quarter. But when you look at it on a sex month basis, you look at it on a 12-month basis, you see pretty consistent share. I think we've gained a little bit. But again, we're managing for profitability. We think share is going to be over a multi-quarter period, pretty stable, and that's actually the way it's working out, you're just seeing some pretty big swings here quarter-over-quarter. So, we feel really good about the competitive situation. The 22 terabyte drive shipped significant volume this quarter. We expect to ramp that throughout the year. We've got big customers very committed to SMR. Our UltraSMR technology gives us a unique position of an additional 20% gain over CMR. And that is in qualification across a number of very large customers. So, we feel like as we ramp throughout calendar year '23, we ramp into a stronger and stronger portfolio as we move through the year.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore : Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I understood the mechanics of the underutilization charge. Is that sort of the cost of just higher cost per bit because you're running underutilized? Or are you -- I mean it sounds like you're pulling some of that forward in time, but maybe not all of it. Can you just talk about what exactly that charge will represent and how that's going to play out this quarter and next?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. Sure, Joe. I should have clarified when I talked about the underutilization that we don't necessarily have a similar approach to the accounting for underutilization as some of our peers. For us, the underutilization charges are taken as a period expense. And so, any portion of the factory that's not being utilized is basically expensed within the quarter. And so, it does not flow through the inventory and back to the P&L, if that helps.\nJoe Moore : Okay. It does. I guess, how are you guys thinking about the signals of like when that goes back to full utilization? I mean do you wait for pricing to stabilize? Or is there something you can see beforehand that will tell you and it's time to kind of keep to move the fab back to full.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Well, we're always talking to our customers, right? So, we have a very good sense of where they're at and what the demand signals are going to be. I mean as we talked about, we expect volumes to increase going into our fiscal fourth quarter. So, as we get closer to that and we understand what that looks like we'll make an incremental decision on when and how to ramp back up the fab.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jason on for Tim from UBS. I have a couple of questions. So, my first question is on your -- on the NAND segment. Sorry if I misunderstood, but I believe you said single-digit bit growth for NAND in calendar year '23. So, I was just curious which end markets are driving this demand weakness this year. Also, I was just curious whether we should expect any potential risk for NAND inventory write-downs in March quarter or June quarter. Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So, Jason, my comment was around the supply side. I would say, single digit, let's call it, high single-digit percentage growth. I didn't necessarily make any comments on the demand side. On the demand side, it'll probably be in the low 20% range in calendar '23 versus calendar '22.  As for the second part of your question, which is related to inventory. Look, we go through the process at the end of every quarter as part of our quarter close. We look at the various demand signals versus the inventory on hand and the costs, et cetera. And we're comfortable with where we ended at the end of calendar Q4.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And my second question is, apart from your comment on the utilization charges, do you guys also see any potential additional risk or purchase order cancellation fees for any type of pay agreements you have with your suppliers if it remains weak in the near term? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: I mean we typically don't forecast these things and we manage the business in a dynamic way. So, I don't expect anything major there.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Again, going back to Wissam's prior comment, that's part of our normal quarterly close process. And if there were any adjustments that were needed to be made, we would have made them at that time. But of course, you got to remeasure it and take a look at it every quarter.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. To first one, David, you mentioned nearline HDD could improve. I'm kind of curious how to think about pricing trends for nearline HDD in the March and June quarter? And also think about the nearline exabyte growth in the first half of this year in calendar '23 overall. And then I had a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I mean, I think the pricing environment has been pretty good throughout this whole cycle. I mean any time you're seeing this kind of underutilization, you're going to see a little bit of pressure on pricing, which is not surprising, I would say we're seeing a little bit more. I mean I think as we look at exabyte growth is -- I think it's pretty clear to say it will be stronger in the second half than the first half. I mean we're going to now ramp back off of this very low in calendar Q4, and we expect growth as we move throughout the calendar year. As we said, we're anticipating modest revenue growth, maybe low to mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter here going into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, we expect margin improvement is, of course, the volume comes back and the underutilization charges drop, and we'll see that continue as we go throughout the calendar year. So -- but we are coming off of very low levels. I think that exabyte growth in the full calendar year will probably be below 20%, something around that. But again, we got to see how it plays out. We got -- we still got big customers going through inventory digestion, some are coming out of it. We'll know more as we work our way through the calendar quarter. And we also have a very dynamic situation in China. The China market has been very subdued for quite a long time now. I would say there are some signs of things getting better. We'll see after we get past the new year, how that progresses. But that could be that -- depending on how that comes back, will have an impact as well, of course.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, just kind of curious, you mentioned the cloud inventory digestion. And you also mentioned that for HDD in March, the cloud business stabilized. So curious on the NAND side or even HDD side, when do you expect this digestion to bottom? And then when you think things start improving from a demand standpoint or maybe your own inventory standpoint. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. That's a very difficult question given how dynamic the market is. I mean I think we're coming off of a very strong quarter of bit growth, 20% sequential bit growth in our FQ2 was a good result. Obviously, it's a very challenging pricing environment. Going into our fiscal third quarter, we see a drop in both bits and pricing. So that's a pretty significant impact on the business. And then current forecast is going into our fiscal Q4, we see the volume pick back up. So that's a little bit a little bit of how we see the dynamics. The pricing environment will change as supply and demand come more into balance. And we're doing everything we can to manage our supply situation, demand balance so that we keep our inventory situation under control, very important in this kind of cycle. And we'll continue to be very dynamic of how we manage it. It literally changes week over week. And again, one of the things I'm very happy about what we've built in the organization over the last several years is a tremendous amount of agility in the organization to react. It's important that we react faster than the market is moving. Otherwise, we just get carried along with the market. And I think we're doing a good job with that to get the best result we can out of a difficult market and prepare ourselves from a technology and portfolio position that when things get more in balance and we get to the inevitable upturn that we're very, very well positioned, and we feel good about that from Flash technology. I talked about BiCS8. Again, we'll talk more about that throughout the quarter. I think you're going to be impressed about the innovation that's in that. I certainly was and also about where we're at in the product portfolio.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you. If I could just follow up on your comment on underutilization charges will be minimal in HDDs in fiscal 4Q. What's giving you the confidence there that this inventory digestion and particularly in the high cap price will largely be done? I know you're coming off low levels, but it also seems like some of the broader cloud customers are starting to tick down as well in terms of their own demand. So, any color you can share on what you're seeing in the market that's giving you the confidence that those underutilization charges will go away in HDDs by fiscal 4Q. And I have a follow-up.\nWissam Jabre: Well, let me start with the answer, Wamsi. When we look at our inventory exiting the fourth quarter, our inventory appears to be in a better position than our peers. And so obviously, when we consider the utilization and where the demand is and the improvement in demand over time on the HDD side, that's really what drove my comment. And so, based on what we see today, this is how we anticipate things to unfold.\nWamsi Mohan: Ok, thanks Wissam. And Dave, you noted in your prepared remarks a lot of different things that you're doing all the things that are kind of under your control, right, negotiating covenants, cutting costs, lowering CapEx, OpEx. And despite all of these, you are sort of doing these converts. So maybe you can just talk about why this incremental liquidity is needed as your view on the market changed materially or your share assumptions changed materially? Or is this more of a strategic investment and just optionality? Just -- maybe any color you can share around that would be helpful.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. It's a number of things. So first of all, it is to give us the flexibility to manage through the depths of the downturn. It's important that we look at -- we have a blend of different kind of financing, both debt and equity. We can't just take all debt. We've got to watch our debt to equity our EBITDA to debt ratios and make sure we manage it all as one package. And I think so that's part of it. A big part of it is kind of facilitating the execution of our strategic review. These. You'll see in the 8-Ks that are filed. These agreements are very complicated and they're very well thought through to give us the ability to execute a range of outcomes and make sure that we can be in a good position as we move to that stage of the process of not putting a time line on that, but these are set up in a way that give us a lot of optionality and flexibility to facilitate that outcome. And then third thing it brings additional capability to our company. Reed Raymond is a very sophisticated technology investor that will join our Board. Elliott will have the right to join our Board under an amended letter agreement with them when they clear some issues at their choice.  So, it brings a lot of capability to us as well. So, we feel good about people investing in the business about the opportunity to do this, and it puts us in a very strong position to continue to execute the business, invest in innovation as well as set ourselves up for the next phase of our strategic review.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I have a follow-up to the last question and then an additional question. I just want to -- should we assume that you're not going to initially draw down the term loan that you have and that's kind of an insurance policy? And how should we -- I'm just trying to figure out interest expense on that. And then I have a follow-up.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, Shannon. So, the one thing to keep in mind is the -- we still have the IRS settlement payment that's expected to be in the fourth quarter. And so, when the time comes for that, we will make a decision based on what's the most efficient way to pay. If we don't need to draw down on our new facility, then we won't do that because obviously, the additional investment also gives us flexibility and optionality from a liquidity perspective.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thanks. And then I'm curious, what changes are you looking at to get down to OpEx at about $600 million a quarter just as you look across your cost basis? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So, when you look at where we ended the December quarter, we were down versus also the September quarter, which was also down versus the previous quarter. So, in other words, from the beginning of the fiscal year until now, we've taken down approximately $100 million. And we guided to be $600 million to $620 million. We continue to take similar actions going through the typical focusing on exiting or reducing all sorts of discretionary expenses. But more importantly, we're basically focusing on maintaining the critical R&D investments so that we continue to invest in our technology and drive the long-term growth. So more of a similar type of actions as we've taken so far. And that should get us close to the $600 million and below that by the end of the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nThomas O'Malley: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the preferred equity convert. We've seen different companies handle them from a dilution perspective where sometimes even out of the money, you'll see them come into the non-GAAP share count. Can you just talk about what you're expecting from dilution there and how you're handling that and the guidance given I really don't see shares getting moved around at all? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: So, Tom, maybe I'll start with the latter part of your question. as we're guiding for a share loss for this quarter, including the dilution of the preferred -- the convert would be anti-dilutive. And so that's why you don't see them reflected in the share count. However, as we swing to a profit, I would expect us to include them as part of our fully diluted share count. So, they'll have some limited dilution impact.\nThomas O'Malley: Helpful. And then just on the recovery side into the fourth quarter on some of the bit shipments or the [indiscernible] can you just -- are you just thinking that it will inflect higher? Or are you expecting a material step-up because you outperformed your peers in the December quarter with the growth you saw there. You're obviously expecting a step down in March. But just talk about the cadence. Is it an extreme step down in March with a small step up? Any kind of color on how you're looking at that forecast given you're giving some color there.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think one of the things we're seeing is one of our big enterprise SSD customers go through a digestion phase in our FQ3 and I think they'll get through that in a quarter and be back to buying. So that should be -- that will get back to a good guy instead of a bad guy as far as the volume. And then we'll -- this is a very seasonally weak quarter for consumers. So, we'll see some step-up there. Client is a little bit TBD is now commercial and enterprise is a little weaker. The consumer side has stabilized. So, I don't want to put too much of qualification on it. But again, we feel good about our ability to have a very diverse portfolio, very diverse go to market engine. We've talked about this from the channel to consumer to the big OEMs to the web players. And I think, quite frankly, we saw last quarter that go to market engine performed really well. And when we get past a few seasonality things and a few things that are idiosyncratic with big customers, we'll see it kick back in and perform well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hi, Jim.\nJim Suva: Thank so much, David. It sounds like with the charge of $250 million now, and you mentioned NAND underutilization starts to kind of go away in Q4. That kind of you're seeing a bottom or the worst of the utilization charges kind of in the March quarter. Is that fair to say? I know you still have to do some adjustments for NAND and wafers based upon how the market goes. But is that fair to say kind of the worst of it and the digestion and equilibrium are kind of hitting in the March quarter? \nWissam Jabre: So, Jim, thanks for the question. My comment around underutilization going away was more related to the HDD side of the business. On the flash side or on the NAND side, I would say it is a dynamic situation. We will continue to assess as we see the demand signal coming. And so, the example I gave earlier was on the assumption that we don't -- that we have only one quarter of underutilization. I wanted to make sure that's well described, so that -- for modeling purposes. But yes, the comment around underutilization disappearing was mostly related to the hard drive side. And look, on the NAND side, also when we exited Q4, we -- our inventory position was better than some of our peers. And we're taking this action to continue to manage our inventory given where the demand picture is today. but that's an evolving situation, and we will be -- we can -- as David said, this is a decision that we can take on a weekly basis if we need to change the approach.\nJim Suva: Thanks, Wissam and David for the details. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you. I was wondering -- I wanted to talk about NAND for a second. Does the capital infusion from the convertible stock and draw on your revolver change your approach to ramping BiCS6 and BiCS8. I asked because 90 days ago, you indicated you'd be pushing out to BiCS transition to reduce your CapEx for fiscal '23. But today, you're also indicating BiCS6 will reach cost crossover with BiCS5 in March, and you're also currently in production of BiCS8. And so, I guess, specifically, when should we expect BiCS8 should reach volume crossover to your NAND business? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I don't think we're that far along to say -- to issue that kind of guidance, I guess, I would call that. But I think what we're saying is BiCS8 is well along in its technology evolution and it's reached production phase like I said -- I wish we had -- on video, I can show you the BiCS8 product I'm holding in my hands and playing with. But yes, I would say the investment doesn't change the way we're thinking about our supply situation. What we're trying to do is match our supply situation to our demand and make sure we can manage our inventory and it doesn't get out of control as we go through this process. We're trying to be very dynamic.  And obviously, when you're slowing down the fab. And one of the ways to do that is to slow down the nodal transition. It brings in this whole question of how long we're going to stay on BiCS6, how fast do we transition to BiCS8. And we're working through all of that. Again, that's a bit dynamic. A lot of it depends on what BiCS8 looks like and how it's being productized. And I think one of the things we're seeing here today is it has reached the productization stage ahead of schedule. And so, we'll have more to say about what that fab mix looks like as we go forward. It's clear we're going to have BiCS6 will be a shorter node. It won't go into every single product if it will go into the products that it needs and then we'll move other products straight to BiCS8.\nKarl Ackerman: I appreciate that. If I may because you are discussing an improvement in HDDs beginning in March, could you discuss whether you need to take further action to rightsized your own inventory of components? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: The quick answer to this, Karl, is we don't see the need to do that. And so, this is why we don't project it. We continue to manage the inventory situation on a dynamic basis. But as of the end of the quarter, we were comfortable on where we are. And from where I stand today, we don't see the need to do that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Bryant: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on that last question about the inventories. Can you expand on the strategy from here? Because I'm looking at your inventory days and they're up from 102 a year ago to 133 days. And you mentioned there's still some demand question. So, I'm trying to understand why start ramping back HDDs next quarter versus taking an inventory write-down versus other strategies to sort of get your inventories in better alignment and generate some better cash flows? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: So, let me maybe just clarify on the HDD side, to be clear, when we look at the inventory movement in the December quarter that just ended, we did reduce the HDD inventory quite a bit. In fact, the increase came from the Flash side. So, when we look at the numbers, I think quarter-to-quarter at the company level, we saw around $90 million reduction in inventories. And those were more than $200 million of reduction was in the HDD side. That was partly offset by some of the growth in Flash. And so, we don't think the inventory situation on the hard drive side is bad. We obviously will continue to monitor as we do on a regular basis. We also are, as part of the $250 million underutilization that we talked about for the March quarter, there are some continued underutilization on the hard drive side, which would allow us to continue to manage inventory very tightly and maintain that discipline on the supply side until, obviously, the demand growth accelerates.  And that's what my comment was about the next quarter, not necessary, in other words, the June quarter, not necessarily seeing as much of hard drive underutilization charges. I hope this clarifies.\nSteven Bryant: Yes. No, that definitely helps filling some of the blanks. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you, Steven.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: A couple of quick ones. On the gross margin side, if I think about fiscal third quarter, if hard drive underutilization charges goes down quarter-over-quarter and revenue goes up modestly, is it fair to assume that gross margins for hard drive goes up. And if that's the case, does that mean NAND gross margin could go below zero in the quarter. Obviously, there's a onetime charge involved.\nWissam Jabre: So, Sidney, this is a fair way of looking at the transition from Q2 to Q3 with the improved utilization or, let's say, smaller -- lesser underutilization on the hard drive side, we expect to see some improvement in the gross margin quarter-to-quarter. And unfortunately, with the high underutilization charge related to the 30% supply cut on the Flash side, we're anticipating the gross margin there to be slightly negative. And so that sums it up.\nSidney Ho: Great. And then my quick follow-up here is just maybe you have covered this already. But how would you characterize the inventory level in the channel and the customers for both hard drive and Flash. It sounds like hard drive is in decent shape. But curious, more curious on the flash side.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I would say it's -- actually, the channel has been pretty good on the client -- on SSDs this past quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual in the channel. I think the channel performance has been -- was actually one of the bright spots last quarter. So, I don't think we see anything too unusual there.\nSidney Ho: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Sidney. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Take care. \nWissam Jabre: Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 second quarter results. The Western Digital team worked diligently within a dynamic market and delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range we provided in October. We reported second quarter revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million. Our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Our ongoing efforts to control expenses, optimize working capital and deploy capital judiciously helped us manage cash flow amidst a challenging flash pricing environment and larger-than-expected ACD underutilization that pressured gross margins.  Before we discuss the details of our second quarter results, I wanted to cover two other announcements that we are making today. First, we disclosed that Western Digital has entered into agreements with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for convertible preferred equity investments totaling $900 million. In connection with the agreement, Reed Raymond, a partner at Apollo, will join our Board starting immediately. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to welcome Reed, a leading technology investor who will provide us with additional financial and strategic expertise, which will be critical as we continue to execute on our business strategy and complete our strategic review. Second, on January 25, we secured access to $875 million of financing through a delayed draw term loan. When combined with the actions we undertook to structurally lower our cost structure, these financings provide valuable financial optionality and flexibility to Western Digital as we continue our strategic review. Regardless of the outcome of the strategic review, our goal is to ensure the business is in a solid financial position to invest in innovation and create long-term shareholder value. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review process or making comments on market rumors. We will provide updates as we have them. Over the past three years, we have worked continuously to reinvigorate innovation and bolster business agility for both our flash and HDD organizations, which enabled the Western Digital team to stay ahead of the market. Over the same period, we paid down $2.7 billion in debt and arranged for settlement of a long-standing tax dispute. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, we have taken additional actions to reset the business in response to the post-pandemic environment. These actions include: first, we have further reduced our capital expenditures across Flash and HDD to moderate our supply. As a result, our projected cash capital expenditure for fiscal 2023 has declined nearly 40% from six months ago. Second, we have decreased supply bid growth across both Flash and HDD. In Flash, we reduced wafer starts by 30% in January. In HDD, during the fiscal first quarter, we consolidated production lines across our manufacturing facilities and idled certain media production lines in Asia, reducing client hard drive capacity by approximately 40%. During the fiscal second quarter, we continued to optimize our capacity enterprise manufacturing footprint to align our supply with the new demand environment. Third, we have reduced our quarterly non-GAAP operating expense by over $100 million since the close of fiscal year 2022, driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and variable compensation. We are targeting to reduce quarterly non-GAAP operating expense level to below $600 million by the time we exit the fiscal year. And lastly, in December, we successfully executed an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreement. Turning to end market demand during the fiscal second quarter. Demand for consumer-oriented products stabilized as we discussed in October. In Consumer, we experienced a seasonal uptick across both Flash and HDD. In client, channel demand for both SSD and HDD have improved. However, commercial PCs are now being impacted by tightening budgets and spending across corporations, which is negatively affecting client SSD shipments. In cloud, we experienced a decline in nearline shipments as our customers were undergoing inventory digestion and ongoing subdued China demand. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. During the fiscal second quarter, our HDD revenue declined significantly as cloud inventory digestion intensified, while demand for retail and client HDD improved.  We continue to successfully execute on our product road map as we completed qualifications and commenced shipments of our latest generation 22-terabyte CMR hard drives at multiple cloud and major OEM customers last quarter. We are aggressively ramping this 22 terabyte CMR product this quarter and expect this drive along with its SMR variants to be our growth engine going forward. Qualifications of our 26 terabyte UltraSMR drives are also progressing well. Our major customers remain committed to adopting SMR drives as the 20% capacity gain that UltraSMR drives over CMR offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide. We expect sequential growth in revenue and margin into our fiscal third quarter and continued recovery as we move through calendar year 2023. Turning to Flash. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading retail franchise combined with strong seasonal demand, bit shipments increased 20% sequentially, exceeding our forecast.  While we continue to experience pricing pressure in the market, our premium brands, including SanDisk, SanDisk Professional and WD_BLACK continued to deliver strong share and profitability to support the business. Our premium WD_BLACK client SSD, which is optimized for gaming continues to be well received in the marketplace. It achieved a record exabyte shipments, unit shipments and average capacity per drive resulting in exabyte shipment increase of 73% sequentially and 41% year-over-year for this product. On the technology front, BiCS5 represented 70% of our flash revenue in the December quarter, while BiCS6 will reach cost crossover in the fiscal third quarter. Our next-generation 3D NAND node BiCS8 has entered productization phase. BiCS8 incorporates several groundbreaking 3D NAND architectural innovations to deliver a major leap in performance and cost-effective solutions to a broad range of exciting products, demonstrating the benefits of Western Digital's strong partnership with Kioxia and our innovation leadership in 3D NAND architecture. As we look into the fiscal third quarter, in hard drives, overall demand in cloud has stabilized, and we expect modest improvement in near line to offset a seasonal decline in client and consumer hard drives. We expect stronger improvements in the second half of this calendar year, led by the aggressive ramp of our 22 and 26 terabyte hard drives. In flash, we expect enterprise SSD product demand for the fiscal third quarter to be sharply reduced as certain large cloud customers have entered a digestion period. In addition, a reduction in commercial PC demand is expected to impact client SSD shipments in the near term. Driven by the lower customer demand forecast in enterprise and client SSDs, we anticipate bit shipments to decline in the fiscal third quarter and return to growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Western Digital lowered wafer starts in January, and we remain flexible in adjusting the magnitude and duration to restore our flash supply and demand balance. As noted, for calendar year 2023, we expect reduced capital investment and lower utilization in response to the new demand environment. Our initial estimate is for flash demand bit growth to be in the low 20% range with production bit growth to be well below that of demand.  With that, let me turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our second quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the third quarter. Thanks, Wissam. Before we open up for questions, I wanted to reiterate our view of the long-term opportunities for both Flash and HDD storage. Importantly, our efforts have enabled us to regain architectural leadership in both Flash and HDD, and we are preparing these technologies to address the meaningful long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With our diverse portfolio, broad go-to-market engine, an enviable retail franchise and a lower cost structure, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. Okay. Peter, let's open up for Q&A. C.J., thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So yes, that's a balancing act. There's no doubt. I mean one of the things we talked about in the script and we feel really good about is BiCS8, I think BiCS8 has reached productization. We'll have more to say about BiCS8. Siva will do -- I think we'll do a webinar during the quarter on all the technological innovation there. There's been an enormous amount of R&D going into that. So, we feel very good about where we are from a technology road map. I'm actually in my hand right here I'm holding a BiCS8 USB, one of the first ones. And so, we're putting enough capital in the system to move BiCS6 along. I mean, BiCS6 will be a shorter node for us. It won't go into all products. We'll be making choices about what we take it into or where we need BiCS6, BiCS5 will serve us well for the rest of the portfolio, and then we'll move right into BiCS8, which quite frankly, is ahead of schedule as far as production, and we feel very good about it. So, we'll balance all of that and have enough capital to accelerate, have enough BiCS6 there that we need it and then accelerate BiCS8 when we see the growth come back. As far as the cost downs, look, I mean, in the second half of the year, cost downs are going to be very difficult because we are far along in BiCS5 and BiCS6 is not ramping that much. We'll return to those as we start to ramp BiCS8.  But we'll still have some, but not to the level, especially with the underutilization of fabs. So, all of those mixed in, we're going to -- we will have gotten most of our cost downs in the first half of the year, and then we'll see them come back as we ramp up BiCS6 and especially BiCS8. So first of all, let me talk about the kind of how we're thinking about it. It is a very dynamic situation. I think when we were looking at our CQ1, we've seen some demand drops. We've come off a very strong quarter of bit growth. We just delivered 20% sequential bit growth. That's why we didn't cut wafers earlier. When we look at our fiscal Q3, we're seeing some drop in both client and enterprise. The enterprise SSD side of it is more a digestion issue. So, to make sure we manage our inventory and we don't get things to build up. And so that's why we're -- we've decided to cut wafer starts in the first quarter.  Again, as Wissam said, that's a -- it's literally a decision we can make every week about how do we load wafers into the fab. Right now, that's a one quarter decision to make sure we keep our supply and demand balanced as best we can. I see Wissam looking up -- do you have a number on the overall bit growth for the year. Yes. I think we signaled this a little bit last quarter. We knew there was going to be some variability in demand across the industry and across customers. Quite frankly, when you're at these revenue levels, which are the lowest we've seen in the long time, orders from big customers make a very big difference.  So, if you go back for the last couple of quarters, the way different big cloud customers, the way either LTAs were restructured, the way big orders came in one way or another, you're seeing some pretty large share shifts quarter-over-quarter. But when you look at it on a sex month basis, you look at it on a 12-month basis, you see pretty consistent share. I think we've gained a little bit. But again, we're managing for profitability. We think share is going to be over a multi-quarter period, pretty stable, and that's actually the way it's working out, you're just seeing some pretty big swings here quarter-over-quarter. So, we feel really good about the competitive situation. The 22 terabyte drive shipped significant volume this quarter. We expect to ramp that throughout the year. We've got big customers very committed to SMR. Our UltraSMR technology gives us a unique position of an additional 20% gain over CMR. And that is in qualification across a number of very large customers. So, we feel like as we ramp throughout calendar year '23, we ramp into a stronger and stronger portfolio as we move through the year. Yes. Well, we're always talking to our customers, right? So, we have a very good sense of where they're at and what the demand signals are going to be. I mean as we talked about, we expect volumes to increase going into our fiscal fourth quarter. So, as we get closer to that and we understand what that looks like we'll make an incremental decision on when and how to ramp back up the fab. Yes. Again, going back to Wissam's prior comment, that's part of our normal quarterly close process. And if there were any adjustments that were needed to be made, we would have made them at that time. But of course, you got to remeasure it and take a look at it every quarter. Yes. I mean, I think the pricing environment has been pretty good throughout this whole cycle. I mean any time you're seeing this kind of underutilization, you're going to see a little bit of pressure on pricing, which is not surprising, I would say we're seeing a little bit more. I mean I think as we look at exabyte growth is -- I think it's pretty clear to say it will be stronger in the second half than the first half. I mean we're going to now ramp back off of this very low in calendar Q4, and we expect growth as we move throughout the calendar year. As we said, we're anticipating modest revenue growth, maybe low to mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter here going into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, we expect margin improvement is, of course, the volume comes back and the underutilization charges drop, and we'll see that continue as we go throughout the calendar year. So -- but we are coming off of very low levels. I think that exabyte growth in the full calendar year will probably be below 20%, something around that. But again, we got to see how it plays out. We got -- we still got big customers going through inventory digestion, some are coming out of it. We'll know more as we work our way through the calendar quarter. And we also have a very dynamic situation in China. The China market has been very subdued for quite a long time now. I would say there are some signs of things getting better. We'll see after we get past the new year, how that progresses. But that could be that -- depending on how that comes back, will have an impact as well, of course. Yes. That's a very difficult question given how dynamic the market is. I mean I think we're coming off of a very strong quarter of bit growth, 20% sequential bit growth in our FQ2 was a good result. Obviously, it's a very challenging pricing environment. Going into our fiscal third quarter, we see a drop in both bits and pricing. So that's a pretty significant impact on the business. And then current forecast is going into our fiscal Q4, we see the volume pick back up. So that's a little bit a little bit of how we see the dynamics. The pricing environment will change as supply and demand come more into balance. And we're doing everything we can to manage our supply situation, demand balance so that we keep our inventory situation under control, very important in this kind of cycle. And we'll continue to be very dynamic of how we manage it. It literally changes week over week. And again, one of the things I'm very happy about what we've built in the organization over the last several years is a tremendous amount of agility in the organization to react. It's important that we react faster than the market is moving. Otherwise, we just get carried along with the market. And I think we're doing a good job with that to get the best result we can out of a difficult market and prepare ourselves from a technology and portfolio position that when things get more in balance and we get to the inevitable upturn that we're very, very well positioned, and we feel good about that from Flash technology. I talked about BiCS8. Again, we'll talk more about that throughout the quarter. I think you're going to be impressed about the innovation that's in that. I certainly was and also about where we're at in the product portfolio. Yes. It's a number of things. So first of all, it is to give us the flexibility to manage through the depths of the downturn. It's important that we look at -- we have a blend of different kind of financing, both debt and equity. We can't just take all debt. We've got to watch our debt to equity our EBITDA to debt ratios and make sure we manage it all as one package. And I think so that's part of it. A big part of it is kind of facilitating the execution of our strategic review. These. You'll see in the 8-Ks that are filed. These agreements are very complicated and they're very well thought through to give us the ability to execute a range of outcomes and make sure that we can be in a good position as we move to that stage of the process of not putting a time line on that, but these are set up in a way that give us a lot of optionality and flexibility to facilitate that outcome. And then third thing it brings additional capability to our company. Reed Raymond is a very sophisticated technology investor that will join our Board. Elliott will have the right to join our Board under an amended letter agreement with them when they clear some issues at their choice.  So, it brings a lot of capability to us as well. So, we feel good about people investing in the business about the opportunity to do this, and it puts us in a very strong position to continue to execute the business, invest in innovation as well as set ourselves up for the next phase of our strategic review. Yes. I think one of the things we're seeing is one of our big enterprise SSD customers go through a digestion phase in our FQ3 and I think they'll get through that in a quarter and be back to buying. So that should be -- that will get back to a good guy instead of a bad guy as far as the volume. And then we'll -- this is a very seasonally weak quarter for consumers. So, we'll see some step-up there. Client is a little bit TBD is now commercial and enterprise is a little weaker. The consumer side has stabilized. So, I don't want to put too much of qualification on it. But again, we feel good about our ability to have a very diverse portfolio, very diverse go to market engine. We've talked about this from the channel to consumer to the big OEMs to the web players. And I think, quite frankly, we saw last quarter that go to market engine performed really well. And when we get past a few seasonality things and a few things that are idiosyncratic with big customers, we'll see it kick back in and perform well. Hi, Jim. Yes. I don't think we're that far along to say -- to issue that kind of guidance, I guess, I would call that. But I think what we're saying is BiCS8 is well along in its technology evolution and it's reached production phase like I said -- I wish we had -- on video, I can show you the BiCS8 product I'm holding in my hands and playing with. But yes, I would say the investment doesn't change the way we're thinking about our supply situation. What we're trying to do is match our supply situation to our demand and make sure we can manage our inventory and it doesn't get out of control as we go through this process. We're trying to be very dynamic.  And obviously, when you're slowing down the fab. And one of the ways to do that is to slow down the nodal transition. It brings in this whole question of how long we're going to stay on BiCS6, how fast do we transition to BiCS8. And we're working through all of that. Again, that's a bit dynamic. A lot of it depends on what BiCS8 looks like and how it's being productized. And I think one of the things we're seeing here today is it has reached the productization stage ahead of schedule. And so, we'll have more to say about what that fab mix looks like as we go forward. It's clear we're going to have BiCS6 will be a shorter node. It won't go into every single product if it will go into the products that it needs and then we'll move other products straight to BiCS8. Yes. I would say it's -- actually, the channel has been pretty good on the client -- on SSDs this past quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual in the channel. I think the channel performance has been -- was actually one of the bright spots last quarter. So, I don't think we see anything too unusual there. Thank you, Sidney. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Take care."

            "name": "Wissam Jabre",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, down 17% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 39% of revenue at $1.2 billion, down 33% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Sequentially, the declines in capacity enterprise drives sold to our cloud customers and smart videos were partly offset by an increase in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 61 exabytes, down sequentially, driven by inventory digestion. The year-over-year decline was also primarily due to inventory digestion in hard drives. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 11% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was driven by pricing pressure across our Flash products, which was partly offset by an increase in hard drive shipments. The year-over-year decline was also due to pricing pressure in Flash as well as lower client SSD shipments for PC applications. Finally, consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by a seasonal uptick in both retail hard drives and Flash shipments. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and pricing pressure in Flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $1.5 billion down 28% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 35% and average price per hard drive decreased 21% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 33%, and average price per unit increased 2%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 4% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 20% on a blended basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 20% sequentially and remained approximately flat year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 17.4%, down 9.3 percentage points sequentially and 16.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 7.8 percentage points sequentially and 9.9 percentage points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decline was due to underutilization related charges of approximately $100 million. Our Flash gross margin was 14.5%, down 10 percentage points sequentially and 21.6 percentage points year-over-year. We are continuing to reduce our costs with operating expenses at $659 million for the quarter, down $30 million sequentially. Operating loss was $119 million. Taxes were a benefit of $48 million. Taxes are influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was a loss of $0.42. operating cash flow for the second quarter was $35 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $240 million. Cash capital expenditure which includes the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was $275 million.  Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.3 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.1 times compared to 1.5 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.8 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. As David mentioned, during the fiscal second quarter, we executed an amendment to the credit agreement that temporarily increased the covenant leverage ratio for the next seven quarters. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a revolver capacity of $2.25 billion for total liquidity of $4.1 billion. Today, we announced multiple agreements to further enhance our liquidity position by $1.8 billion as follows.  On January 25, we closed the delayed draw term loan agreement with our lenders in the amount of $875 million. In addition, as David mentioned, Western Digital entered into an agreement with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for a convertible preferred investment of $900 million.  Together, these actions significantly increase our ability to access liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility and optionality as we manage through this challenging downturn and execute on our strategic review. Before I go over guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook and the financial impact associated with the actions we are taking to rightsize our cost structure.  In HDD, we expect revenue to increase modestly in the fiscal third quarter as growth in nearline shipments outpaces decline in consumer. In Flash, we expect both shipments and ASP to decrease sequentially. We expect bit growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to approximately $2.3 billion compared to our prior forecast of $3.2 billion entering this fiscal year. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure to $900 million which is about 40% below our forecast six months ago. The primary drivers of our lower capital expenditures are the delay of the BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investment levels in both client and capacity enterprise hard drive manufacturing.  We have reduced our quarterly operating expenses by over $100 million compared to six months ago. We are targeting to exit this fiscal year with quarterly operating expenses below $600 million. These actions will allow us to weather this cycle while also enabling us to continue advancing our innovative product road map going forward. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 9% and 11%, which includes underutilization charges in Flash and HDD totaling $250 million, with Flash driven by a 30% reduction in wafer starts.  We expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect tax expenses to be between $60 million and $70 million for the fiscal third quarter and approximately $240 million to $260 million for the fiscal year. We expect loss per share of $1.70 to $1.40 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 319 million shares outstanding. I will now turn the call back over to David. Yes. C.J., so the -- for the March quarter, we're projecting $250 million in total. That's between both Flash and HDD. We expect the probably, I would say, 3/4 of those to be in the Flash -- on the flash side and 1/4 in the HDD business. As we roll into the fourth quarter, I expect HDD to become minimal. But Flash will depend on how long we continue with the underutilization. The way to think of it is typically we -- as we under or as sort of we reduce the wafer starts, given the cycle time, we expect approximately 60% to 70% of the impact to come in the first, let's say, 90 days and then the remaining impact would be in the following quarter. So, the way to think of it is the March quarter would have around 60% to 70% of the impact from the underutilization for -- that we've taken -- the actions we've taken so far. Now that said, it could be that, depending on how the demand picture evolves, we haven't yet decided how long the underutilization is going to be, and we'll manage this in a very dynamic way as we continue to look at market inputs and so on. My comments were around assuming, let's say, a one-quarter event. Yes. I think the -- from a supply perspective, I would say, it will be in the lower -- I would say, it's probably given the CapEx situation, we're looking at this to be in the single-digit growth from a supply perspective. Yes. Sure, Joe. I should have clarified when I talked about the underutilization that we don't necessarily have a similar approach to the accounting for underutilization as some of our peers. For us, the underutilization charges are taken as a period expense. And so, any portion of the factory that's not being utilized is basically expensed within the quarter. And so, it does not flow through the inventory and back to the P&L, if that helps. Yes. So, Jason, my comment was around the supply side. I would say, single digit, let's call it, high single-digit percentage growth. I didn't necessarily make any comments on the demand side. On the demand side, it'll probably be in the low 20% range in calendar '23 versus calendar '22.  As for the second part of your question, which is related to inventory. Look, we go through the process at the end of every quarter as part of our quarter close. We look at the various demand signals versus the inventory on hand and the costs, et cetera. And we're comfortable with where we ended at the end of calendar Q4. I mean we typically don't forecast these things and we manage the business in a dynamic way. So, I don't expect anything major there. Well, let me start with the answer, Wamsi. When we look at our inventory exiting the fourth quarter, our inventory appears to be in a better position than our peers. And so obviously, when we consider the utilization and where the demand is and the improvement in demand over time on the HDD side, that's really what drove my comment. And so, based on what we see today, this is how we anticipate things to unfold. Yes, Shannon. So, the one thing to keep in mind is the -- we still have the IRS settlement payment that's expected to be in the fourth quarter. And so, when the time comes for that, we will make a decision based on what's the most efficient way to pay. If we don't need to draw down on our new facility, then we won't do that because obviously, the additional investment also gives us flexibility and optionality from a liquidity perspective. Yes. So, when you look at where we ended the December quarter, we were down versus also the September quarter, which was also down versus the previous quarter. So, in other words, from the beginning of the fiscal year until now, we've taken down approximately $100 million. And we guided to be $600 million to $620 million. We continue to take similar actions going through the typical focusing on exiting or reducing all sorts of discretionary expenses. But more importantly, we're basically focusing on maintaining the critical R&D investments so that we continue to invest in our technology and drive the long-term growth. So more of a similar type of actions as we've taken so far. And that should get us close to the $600 million and below that by the end of the fourth quarter. So, Tom, maybe I'll start with the latter part of your question. as we're guiding for a share loss for this quarter, including the dilution of the preferred -- the convert would be anti-dilutive. And so that's why you don't see them reflected in the share count. However, as we swing to a profit, I would expect us to include them as part of our fully diluted share count. So, they'll have some limited dilution impact. So, Jim, thanks for the question. My comment around underutilization going away was more related to the HDD side of the business. On the flash side or on the NAND side, I would say it is a dynamic situation. We will continue to assess as we see the demand signal coming. And so, the example I gave earlier was on the assumption that we don't -- that we have only one quarter of underutilization. I wanted to make sure that's well described, so that -- for modeling purposes. But yes, the comment around underutilization disappearing was mostly related to the hard drive side. And look, on the NAND side, also when we exited Q4, we -- our inventory position was better than some of our peers. And we're taking this action to continue to manage our inventory given where the demand picture is today. but that's an evolving situation, and we will be -- we can -- as David said, this is a decision that we can take on a weekly basis if we need to change the approach. The quick answer to this, Karl, is we don't see the need to do that. And so, this is why we don't project it. We continue to manage the inventory situation on a dynamic basis. But as of the end of the quarter, we were comfortable on where we are. And from where I stand today, we don't see the need to do that. So, let me maybe just clarify on the HDD side, to be clear, when we look at the inventory movement in the December quarter that just ended, we did reduce the HDD inventory quite a bit. In fact, the increase came from the Flash side. So, when we look at the numbers, I think quarter-to-quarter at the company level, we saw around $90 million reduction in inventories. And those were more than $200 million of reduction was in the HDD side. That was partly offset by some of the growth in Flash. And so, we don't think the inventory situation on the hard drive side is bad. We obviously will continue to monitor as we do on a regular basis. We also are, as part of the $250 million underutilization that we talked about for the March quarter, there are some continued underutilization on the hard drive side, which would allow us to continue to manage inventory very tightly and maintain that discipline on the supply side until, obviously, the demand growth accelerates.  And that's what my comment was about the next quarter, not necessary, in other words, the June quarter, not necessarily seeing as much of hard drive underutilization charges. I hope this clarifies. Thank you, Steven. So, Sidney, this is a fair way of looking at the transition from Q2 to Q3 with the improved utilization or, let's say, smaller -- lesser underutilization on the hard drive side, we expect to see some improvement in the gross margin quarter-to-quarter. And unfortunately, with the high underutilization charge related to the 30% supply cut on the Flash side, we're anticipating the gross margin there to be slightly negative. And so that sums it up. Thank you."

I am pleased to see the Western Digital team work together to deliver revenue at the upper half of the guidance range in the midst of an incredibly dynamic and challenging macroeconomic environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $3.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income of $307 million. Our operating income performance was above the midpoint implied by our guidance and demonstrated our ability to actively respond and navigate this environment. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and included an approximately $0.30 impact due to higher than forecasted tax rate. Overall, the actions we have taken over the past few years are enabling us to manage through business cycle troughs more effectively and position the company to thrive as market conditions improve. These efforts have reinvigorated the Western Digital innovation engine and strengthened our product portfolio. In particular, we are leading the transition to SMR-based hard drives alongside our cloud customers, showcasing our product leadership. In flash, we have nearly tripled our bit shipments in the NVMe enterprise SSD product category as compared to the last down cycle, adding another large and growing end market in which we can allocate our flash bits. Our industry-leading innovation, diversified portfolio and broad go-to-market strategy across cloud, client and consumer end markets allow us to enjoy strong relationships with our customers and meet the full range of storage needs. The breadth of markets we address also offers us unique visibility into end market demand signals, which allowed us to recognize potential challenges to our business as they unfolded. We have proactively and effectively managed our business through weakening consumer demand by optimizing product mix and rightsizing our hard drive manufacturing footprint. As part of these efforts to manage through this part of the cycle, we are reducing our capital investments and operating expenses as we move to align our cash flow and cost structure with market conditions. Wissam will go over our efforts in more detail. As we closely monitor the macro environment, we are encouraged to see retail flash and channel demand leveling out and orders from PC customers stabilizing, a sign that consumer-led inventory correction is abating. We believe the long-term growth in flash demand, combined with reduced flash industry supply will restore supply and demand balance in the next couple of quarters. Before I jump into updates on our HD and Flash businesses, I want to provide a short update on our strategic review process. The executive committee of our Board, which I lead, continues its process, which I previously announced includes the participation of Elliott Management under a non-disclosure agreement. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today. We will provide updates as we have them. Now turning to our HDD business. During the first quarter, our HDD revenue declined modestly as we had forecasted in August. Sequentially, total HDD and nearline exabyte shipments were both flat. Continued momentum with U.S. cloud customers and accelerated adoption of SMR hard drives were offset by softness in other capacity enterprise product channels and consumer HDD demand. Shipment of capacity enterprise drives based on SMR technologies exceeded 25% of this category, one quarter ahead of our expectations. We now expect SMR to represent over 40% of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipment exiting fiscal year 2023. SMR adoption drove a 19% sequential and 21% year-over-year increase in average capacity to 17 terabytes per capacity enterprise drive, and our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments increased more than 150% sequentially. We are deep into the process of qualifying our latest generation of hard drives, including our 26 terabyte UltraSMR hard drives at multiple U.S. cloud and OEM customers. Interest in SMR from other hyperscalers worldwide is increasing as the 20% capacity gain offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide. Looking ahead, our U.S. cloud customers have started sharply reducing their hard drive inventory alongside other components for their data center build-outs. This, along with continued subdued demand across markets in China, will impact near-term demand over the next few quarters. Despite these near-term corrections, it is clear from our conversations with these customers that HDD products will be the foundational storage for their continued cloud build-out in the years to come. Our product leadership and innovation engine remain as strong as ever and we are confident that Western Digital's hard drive business will thrive over the long-term as demand improves and new products continue to ramp. Turning to flash. Revenue was slightly ahead of our expectations. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading brands, including WD Black, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional that are recognized globally for their cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. I'm pleased to say that we exceeded our bit shipment forecast this quarter. Our client SSD products for PC OEM, retail and mobile drove the upside in bit shipments. Average capacity per client SSD increased 24% sequentially and 54% year-over-year, driven by doubling of standard storage capacity for PCs sold by multiple OEMs. This is another reminder of the insatiable demand for data storage and the resilience of flash demand as price elasticity drives increased consumption per device. On the technology front, BiCS5 accelerated to over two thirds of our flash revenue in the September quarter, up from about half in the previous quarter. BiCS6 yield and development of subsequent 3D NAND flash are both progressing well. For the December quarter, we expect flash shipments to increase sequentially, led by seasonal strength in retail and mobile. With the abrupt change in market conditions, we are acting decisively to adjust our supply trajectory to align with demand. We are pushing out BiCS6 transition to meaningfully reduce our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 which may offer us a potential opportunity to leapfrog to a future BiCS technology node as demand normalizes. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our first quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the second quarter.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, revenue was in line, thanks to our team's agility and resilience in managing through this dynamic environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 17% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and, as David mentioned, included an approximately $0.30 impact due to the higher than forecasted tax rate. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 49% of revenue at $1.8 billion, down 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, continued momentum in capacity enterprise drives sold to U.S. cloud customers and an increase in smart video hard drive demand partly offset the decline in all other hard drive product channels and flash. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments were flat at 112 exabytes, driven by our success in leading the industry transition to SMR hard drives. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline across both hard drive and flash products. Clients represented 33% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 25% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was attributed to flash driven by inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower pricing. The year-over-year decline resulted primarily from the reduced flash pricing. Lastly, consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.7 billion, down 15% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the revenue decline was due to flash pricing and lower retail HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $2 billion, down 5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, total HDD exabyte shipments increased by 1% and average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $125. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 12% and average price per unit increased by 23%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 28% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Sequentially, flash ASPs were down 22% on a blended basis and 17% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 10% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 26.7%, down 5.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 28.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down 2.4 percentage points year-over-year. Our flash gross margin was 24.5%, down 11.4 percentage points sequentially and 12.5 percentage points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $689 million, down $71 million sequentially and below our guidance range due to lower variable expenses and tighter expense management, including reduction of discretionary spending. Operating income was $307 million, representing a 56% decrease from the prior quarter and a 68% decrease year-over-year. As David mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered operating income above the midpoint implied by our guidance in a challenging market backdrop. Our tax expense was $168 million, resulting in a tax rate of 72% higher than previously forecasted. Tax expense is influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was $0.20 compared to $1.78 in the prior quarter and $2.49 in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $6 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $215 million. Cash capital expenditures, which includes the purchase of property, plant, equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $221 million. Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.1 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.7x compared to 2x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Before I go over guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I would like to discuss the business outlook for the balance of this fiscal year and the actions we are taking to align our execution plan with the changes in business environment. In flash, we expect shipments to increase sequentially in the fiscal second quarter and the balance of the fiscal year 2023 as the market stabilizes. In HDD, we expect our revenue to recover as our U.S. cloud customers reduced their inventories over the next two quarters. On the manufacturing front, we have sharply reduced client hard drive production capacity by approximately 40%. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to $2.7 billion. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure by 20% versus our prior expectation. The main drivers of our lower capital expenditures are primarily the push out of BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investments in hard drive manufacturing. As for our operating expenses, we proactively reduced our spending by approximately $80 million in the first fiscal quarter relative to the midpoint of the guidance range. We are also taking further action to lower our ongoing operating expenses range to $650 million to $700 million as we navigate this dynamic environment. We believe these actions we are taking will allow us to continue to invest in innovation as a top priority for our company going forward. For the fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 20% and 22%. We expect operating expenses to be between $650 million and $670 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $80 million. We expect the tax benefit between $70 million and $90 million. We expect loss per share of $0.25 to earnings per share of $0.05 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me briefly wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. While near-term market conditions are challenging, digital transformation continues to drive long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With products and solutions that play in every part of the technology ecosystem, Western Digital can meet customers' needs across the spectrum and unlock the possibilities of data. For example, while we are successfully managing through the consumer-led downturn, which is showing signs of stabilization, we are ramping multiple new products into data centers worldwide. As we remain focused on innovation and execution, I am optimistic that Western Digital will emerge stronger as we continue to ramp multiple new products into data centers worldwide and market conditions improve. With our top-tier team innovative and diversified portfolio, broad customer base and differentiated go-to-market engine, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities stemming from the rapid global adoption of the cloud and the expansive and growing ecosystem it supports. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their hard work during this quarter and for solidifying our leadership in storage. In the face of an extremely challenging macro environment, our team worked together to deliver solid financial performance for Western Digital. I\u2019m proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in calendar 2023 and beyond. All right, Peter. With that, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go into the Flash business and kind of parse out kind of how you're thinking about the gross margin trajectory into the December quarter guidance? And specifically, within that, your JV partner, Kioxia announced a couple of weeks ago that they were going to cut production by as much as 30%. I'm curious your gross margin expectations. Have you taken any actions to take out production? And with that, any underutilization charges that are baked into your expectations into the December quarter? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Aaron, good morning. And thanks for the question. We have not taken any major underutilization actions in the fab. We always reserve that right in the future, depending on market conditions. So when we look at our \u2013 the way to think about Q4, and I'll invite calendar Q4, Wissam, obviously, make some comments. I mean we're still under a \u2013 pricing is still under pressure. I think that's fairly clear what's going on in the market. And then we've got a sequential increase, slight increase in bit shipments. So think that's one way to think about how we're thinking about the quarter. Wissam, anything to add?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. The only thing \u2013 I mean, I think the only thing I would add, David, is yes, pricing is pretty much what's going to be the main driver of gross margin in the calendar Q4.\nAaron Rakers: And then as a quick follow-up on the hard disk drive, the nearline, it sounds like you and your competitors are going through some digestion at some of your CSP partners. What's the expectation for the December quarter? It sounds like you expect \u2013 is the expectation is that shipments start to improve going into the March quarter at this point? And then I'll see the floor. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we're going to \u2013 you've got it. We're going to see a sharp decline in shipments in calendar Q4 and that's going to lead to some pretty significant absorption charges or underutilization charges. And then will grow back out of that as we move into \u2013 as we move through 2023.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-up to the prior first question around NAND. I was hoping you could speak maybe more broadly around your NAND bit allocation strategy. You spoke to no underutilization charges today. I think your NAND gross margins, obviously moving lower. And in the last cycle, I think in 2019, we troughed at 19%, so curious, how are you thinking about what business you'll take, what you won't take and how that will impact, whether desire to build inventory and/or choose to cut utilization at some point.\nDavid Goeckeler: Good morning. So I think this is \u2013 the strategy we've been executing over the last couple of years and what we've been talking about, I think, is really paying off for us now at this part of the cycle. We've worked very hard to drive the portfolio abroad and deep portfolio across consumer, across mobile. We obviously still stay qualified at all the vendors, the client SSD portfolio is an anchor of the portfolio, gaming. And now we've added enterprise SSD into the mix. So we've always talked about \u2013 we want to have a broad portfolio to be qualified everywhere we can. And then be able to mix based on what gets us to the best return. And so I think at this part of the cycle, we're able to do that. And it also gives us quite a few homes for our supply. So that allows us in a tough quarter, have sequential bit growth. Obviously, pricing is market-based pricing. So we participate in the market and it allows us to basically just change the mix to get the best return we can. So again, I think the portfolio strategy we've been pursuing and we've been talking about getting qualified at the hyperscalers on enterprise SSD, and that is \u2013 that gives us another really important home for our supply. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think when you look across the portfolio, we have five or six categories, depending on the quarter, if you look at it for the whole fiscal year, we'll have six different categories where we have a double-digit mix of bits going into those different parts of the market. So I think it gives us a lot of optionality and the ability to generate the best return we can.\nC.J. Muse: That's very helpful. I guess, a follow-up on your technology road map. You talked about theoretically potentially skipping a node. And historically, players in the market have not done very well when they pursue that strategy. So I guess, can you kind of walk through what gives you the confidence that, that's something that would make sense for you guys, just given the historical precedents?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think the way we think about it right now, BiCS6 is \u2013 we're taking the actions around capital investment to slow down our bit supply in the market to try and get the market balance. I think everybody is doing that. There's really an enormous number of actions to try and get the market back in balance. We feel good about those. We'll take effect next year as we move through the year. What it means for us is BiCS6 will be a shorter node. At this point, the follow-on node BiCS8 is progressing very, very well. And as we move through the year, we'll be able to make a judgment about how long we're going to stay on which node. There's a number of issues around qualifications of products and all those kinds of things. So we'll make thoughtful decisions about that when we get closer to that point as we move through 2023. But we feel very good about where both nodes are and how they're progressing and that will give us the \u2013 give us, again, more optionality about how we think about what products we put in the market to get us the best financial return and obviously, the best solution for our customers.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Sounds like you guys are pretty optimistic that this improves. But I guess in the event that it doesn't, if earnings stay at this level for a few quarters or get worse, it looks like you might be challenged on the leverage ratio. We've talked to a bunch of people in credit, and it sounds like that's a relatively easy amendment to make that there's no strain to it, if you do it quickly. So just wondering how are you thinking about that? Are you \u2013 and then just sort of broader, more philosophically, it feels like it's going to be a tough economic year next year, there could be a lot of challenges. But with Chinese supply out of the mix, the next NAND cycle should be pretty exciting. So I feel like as you think about more negative scenarios, how do you think about weathering the storm and making sure that the kind of $15 of earnings power you did a few years ago is something we might see in the future?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. Good morning, Joe, thanks for the question. So with respect to the first part of your question, look, we're \u2013 we entered this down cycle in a very much stronger financial position than the previous one. If you recall, we reduced our debt by $2.7 billion. We've improved the earnings power of the business. We strengthened our portfolio. And also, if you look at our liquidity at the end of Q1, we had around $4.3 billion between a little bit more than $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and the $2.25 billion revolver that's undrawn. So we have ample liquidity to operate within the \u2013 in the next few quarters. And from where we are now, we're very comfortable in terms of the continued profitability of the business.\nDavid Goeckeler: Joe, and just to add to that, I mean, we're thinking about how you are. I mean, look, we've got a \u2013 we've got to get through this phase of the cycle. I think there's been a lot of discussion about everything from reduced utilization to pushing out CapEx. To your point, there are some regulations that are going to impact supply in the market in 2023. So we're optimistic about the next cycle about getting there. The market is all the \u2013 we're reacting strongly to get supply and demand back in balance. But we \u2013 as Wissam said, we've invested in our balance sheet \u2013 we've invested in innovation in our portfolio to build the resiliency and the agility in the business to manage through this.\nJoe Moore: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on the NAND business as well. So David, based on the CapEx decisions you've made over the past couple of months, how should we think about your bit supply growth in, say, calendar 2023. Obviously, you've got bids on your balance sheet. But on a manufacturing basis, given the decisions you've made, how should we think about bit supply growth. And it seems like you're not cutting production like many of your other peers. I guess, my question is, why not? Is that a function of the contaminant issue earlier in the year and you're looking to regain some ground? Or is there something else? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: No, it's \u2013 on the second part of your question, it's not because of that at all. It's because we have a lot of homes for our supply, and we're able to get, we think, a good economic return for that. So from \u2013 just purely from an economic point of view, it makes sense for us to continue to build the supply. We're definitely going to slow down our bit supply. I think you can think like low to mid-20s for supply next year is kind of the way we're thinking about it.\nToshiya Hari: Okay, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to your initial comments around consumer stabilization. I know you alluded to some points around retail and PC orders. And I was hoping that you can maybe double click a little bit on what you're seeing both in retail and PC orders, specifically. And also perhaps touch on your expectation of inventory levels exiting the December quarter. Thank you so much.\nDavid Goeckeler: So let me take the first part, and I'll ask Wissam to comment on inventory. If we go back and we look at kind of the progression of what's happened this year. Back in March, we \u2013 roughly the March time frame, we saw the consumer market come under pressure. We talked a lot about that. In let's call it, the June time frame, we saw the PC OEMs really start adjusting their inventory very aggressively. We talked about that last quarter. And we've seen that play out during the quarter now in a number of different fronts. And then just within the last month or two, we've started to see the big data center operators do the same thing, really sharply adjust their inventory. And obviously, that's factored into our guide. So we've seen this kind of rolling change as it goes through one market to the next. If you look at the other side of it, where are they at in that process, consumer market, we're seeing relatively predictable behavior, it's not like it's at a great point, but it's not falling the way it was, our ability to predict where it's going to be week-over-week and month-over-month have increased. And so we've got more confidence we understand where that market is at and how it's going to play out going forward. In the PC market and see Q4, we're actually going to see some sequential growth in units of client SSD, not a huge amount, but it's sequential growth. Again, we talked about a very, very sharp inventory correction. So we're starting to see \u2013 we're getting to the point there where the inventory correction last quarter was quite severe. I mean, when customers going down to less than 10% of their usual demand. Now we see things coming back and stabilizing a little bit. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that things are back up and back up and to the right, but they're stabilizing a bit, and we're starting to see some signs that we're getting more predictable behavior and then that we can then grow out at this point. Obviously, the data center, the big U.S. hyperscalers were just kind of going into that. And we'll have more to say as we \u2013 it's going to be a couple of quarters, but we'll have more to say as we go through the quarter of what we're seeing and then what we see going into next quarter. Inventory?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. And on the second part of the question, Wamsi. In Q1, we saw approximately a couple of hundred million dollars of growth in inventory at the end of the quarter. Our days of inventory were at 128. We're expecting to see a similar type of trends in the calendar Q4, roughly speaking, let's say, $100 million to $200 million growth and a bit of an increase in our days of inventory.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, I had a question, and then I had a clarification. So the question is on NAND cost. And the question really is sort of what the push out of BiCS6 does to your longer term? And when I say longer term, I mean like inside of calendar 2023 and into 2024, like what that does to your NAND cost curve? You've been bringing costs down mid-teens. I know it's going to be less than that next year. But what is the push out due to your cost curve? And then I wanted to clarify on the HDD margin assumption for December, can you sort of disaggregate a little bit what you think HDD margins will be for December like what's implied? It seems like gross margin is down to smidge that's being implied in your guidance? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. On NAND cost, when we went through the CapEx exercise, we obviously kept a very close eye on still being able to drive cost declines. It's a very important element of the whole model of what we're doing here. So we're still comfortable with you modeling 15% year-over-year cost declines. I mean, clearly, there'll be some variability from quarter-to-quarter, but we still target that 15% year-over-year. It's a big part \u2013 I've talked about this a lot in the past. It's an actual input into the process, into the design process, not an output. And so we really designed to meet that, and it's a strong part of what we're \u2013 what the whole business is about. HDD margins will be under pressure next quarter. We will have \u2013 as I said before, we'll have some significant underutilization costs that will go into the financials \u2013 the other side of that is pricing in nearline and capacity enterprise has been stable benign about what we expect. But we're clearly going to have to \u2013 we're going to slow down production significantly, and that will hit us in the margin line next quarter. And then we'll grow out of that as volume comes back. And as we go through 2023, we also feel very \u2013 we feel very good that we're going to be ramping into the 22-terabyte drive, which is deep in qualification at a lot of different places around the world. And also the 26-terabyte UltraSMR drive is in qualification as well. And we talked a lot about SMR in the prepared remarks, that is a technology we believe very strongly. That's the next phase of the data center is SMR. And it was \u2013 just last quarter, we talked about ending the year with 25% of our exabytes in that market being SMR, we achieved that a quarter early. And now we expect to exit the fiscal year with over 40% of our exabytes being shipped on SMR. So I feel really good about where the portfolio is. And as we grow out of this sharp inventory correction through 2023, we'll be going into strength in the product road map.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I'm just wondering, can you talk a bit about the pricing environment, both in NAND and drives. And how both \u2013 you expect the prices to move from an absolute basis and then also from a mixed basis, the 22, 26, et cetera comes out over time. I\u2019m just wondering how we should sort of think about that. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Pricing in HTD has been something we\u2019ve been very much focused on. We feel very, very positive about the innovation we\u2019re bringing to market. I mean, that\u2019s where all \u2013 everything about pricing starts with innovation. You got to bring a great product to market. You got to continue to drive a better value proposition for our customers. And we believe strongly we\u2019re doing that. These new drives have very good TCO benefits for our \u2013 the largest data center operators in the world. So pricing in nearline has been, I think benign is the word I\u2019ve used for many quarters now, and I would continue to use that word. And we\u2019re going to be focused on value-based pricing as we ramp into 22 and 26. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Again, it\u2019s all about driving a better TCO value proposition through innovation, and then we get to share that benefit of that with our customers. In NAND pricing has clearly been under pressure. I think that\u2019s very well documented. As I said before that look at our pricing last quarter, like for like for like minus 17%, blended minus 22%, we\u2019re clearly mixing this \u2013 the mix hurts the pricing a bit, but it also allows us to move a lot of supply. And we think it\u2019s the right \u2013 we think it\u2019s the right decision for the business. We expect pricing to be under pressure in calendar Q4 as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick one on SMR. Can you talk a little bit about how to think about SMR in terms of your revenue mix? And also how many customers you have? And are you seeing any nearline HDD share shifts because of the SMR position? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We don\u2019t talk about specific customers. But what I can say is there\u2019s multiple, very large customers committed to SMR, some of the largest data center operators in the world. And I think the whole industry is especially UltraSMR. I mean, SMR has been around a long time, right? SMR has been shipped and client drives for a long time, but it actually requires some work on the host side for the data center operators. So when we were able to introduce UltraSMR and get plus 20% on a CMR drive versus the industry standard of plus 10% that really changed the equation a bit. And when you can get 20% capacity uplift, it\u2019s worth the investment on the host site. And we\u2019re seeing that \u2013 we\u2019re seeing that move across a lot of operators be very interested in that. So we don\u2019t break out specific customers. I said on an exabyte basis, we expect it to be over 40% exiting the fiscal year. I think you can assume on a revenue basis, it\u2019ll be slightly more than that. But I think that\u2019s how we think about it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I also have one question, two parts. Your wafer purchase based on cost plus and given continued weakness in NAND prices, how is that going to impact your margin? There was a reference earlier of a minimum margin of 19%, and I just want to make sure that we understand that there is that minimum gross margin given the fact that you actually purchase wafer from the JV. And on the HDD side, as you think about the dynamics, if we\u2019re actually seeing the bottoming into next year, how are you planning for your capacity and what kind of exabyte growth are you forecasting for your HDD manufacturing capacity that you have online? And in other words, how are you thinking about your HDD capacity? What kind of assumption for shipment you have? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right, let me \u2013 I\u2019ll make some comments here and then I\u2019m sure Wissam will probably have something to add as well. So first of all, let\u2019s clarify the comment on gross margin. There is no minimum gross margin. I think the comment was that in the last down cycle, the company\u2019s gross margin bottomed at 19% in flash. I will note that that number did not include the underutilization charges. And when you include the underutilization charges, Wissam, I know we calculated this number.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. We\u2019re in the sort of let\u2019s say between the \u2013 it\u2019s in the low teens.\nDavid Goeckeler: Low teens, okay. So I think that was just a \u2013 Mehdi, I just think that was a benchmark that one of the previous questioners was using. So you\u2019re right about how we get the \u2013 how the JV economics work. But again, our \u2013 the way we think about the portfolio is if we can get the \u2013 if we can \u2013 if we have a home for the bits, that\u2019s number of \u2013 that\u2019s the first thing like, do we have a place where we can \u2013 do we have customers that value our innovation in our portfolio and we have a place to put the supply and then we look at pricing and then we look at that equation and does it make economic sense to do that and we drive the portfolio. We\u2019re actually given where we are in the cycle, we\u2019re pleased with the gross margin we\u2019re able to drive in the business at this point. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. Exabyte growth, I mean, clearly we\u2019re going to slow down ACD exabyte growth. I think this \u2013 that the industry is going through a pretty large digestion cycle. Part of the CapEx pushout that we saw them talked about, the lion share of that is on the flash side of the business. But we\u2019re also moving out ACD CapEx as well to slow down our exabyte growth there. We have a lot of conviction that the market\u2019s still going to grow in that high 20, 30 plus range on exabyte growth, but we\u2019re going to have to grow back into that as we go through this inventory correction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the inventories 6% sequential growth and I know you guys expect more sequential growth in inventories this quarter. Is the build more flash or HDD driven? I\u2019m talking about the September quarter. And then given the sharp pull back in clouds, you guys are cutting utilizations in HDD this quarter. But are you guys also holding back shipments of HDD in the December quarter? And then on the NAND side, despite the sequential growth for bits and flash, are you guys holding back some shipments in the December quarter?\nWissam Jabre: So let me take the question. So with respect to inventory in the September quarter the majority of the inventory growth was in NAND. On the HDD side, we were mostly flattish. As we look into the December quarter, we\u2019re expecting to continue to see more NAND inventory growth and there will be some HDD inventory growth, but not as much as we are anticipating to see NAND growth there. And the HDD growth will be basically just driven by the weakness we\u2019re seeing in the market. But also we will \u2013 we\u2019re carefully managing our utilization. They will be under absorption costs. We\u2019re also trying to carefully manage our utilization going forward. And in terms of the \u2013 the part of the question with respect to holding shipments no, we\u2019re not planning to hold shipments.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom O\u2019Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTom O\u2019Malley: Hey, thanks for taking my question, guys. You guys have seen a pretty long stretchier of seeing HDD ASPs on the rise. Obviously with a lot of moving parts with the weakness that you\u2019re seeing, could you guys comment on what you expect HDD ASPs as a whole? You report the number every quarter to do sequentially. Is it falling because of mix or is there any puts and takes that we need to be considering when we look at the December guide? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. The transition is primarily driven by mix. That\u2019s a key driver for HDD.\nPeter Andrew: Yes. So Tom, if you look at calendar Q4, you should expect ASP for HDDs to be down, mainly driven by mix as the hyperscale guys go through the digestion phase.\nTom O\u2019Malley: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. You mentioned Q4 will be burdened or December quarter will be burdened with underutilization charges. Is that kind of the brunt of it, the worst or the most amount to be absorbed there, and then we start to improve going after? Or does it continue? And you mentioned CapEx, you\u2019re slowing that down. Could you quantify or give us some CapEx guidance about where we should kind of anticipate for CapEx and for modeling cash flow around CapEx? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So on the comment with respect to underutilization, yes, from where we stand today, this seems to be where we see probably underutilization at its lowest. And we would start getting ourselves out of that as demand improves. With respect to CapEx, we are aiming to reduce our cash CapEx for the fiscal year by 20%. Ideally we want to do more. The way to think of it is in our cash CapEx the 20% is roughly split around the 30% reduction with respect \u2013 and these are relative to our previous expectations. So 30% lower than previously expected on the NAND side. And on the HTD side, it\u2019s a reduction of 10% to 15% relative to the previous expectations.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the free cash flow expectation. What is your expectation for the December quarter and for fiscal 2023 and perhaps kind of trajectory of how things go? And maybe I\u2019ll throw this one in too. When you look at the inventory still going up next quarter, are you concerned about inventory write-downs, especially given name gross margin? I think it was 25% probably going down for a couple more quarters. Thanks.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So Sidney, for free cash flow, we\u2019re projecting a negative free cash flow in the December quarter and for the fiscal year. Keep in mind that we have the IRS settlement payment that is still projected to be in the fiscal 2023. And this was estimated at $600 million to $700 million. With respect to inventory, look, we did see a small impact in terms of write-down in the September quarter. Ultimately, it all depends on how the net pricing develops in the next few quarters. So it\u2019s difficult to predict at this time, but it will depend on where the net pricing progresses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question.\nDavid Goeckeler: Good morning.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes, good morning. Yeah, just interested in hearing what you\u2019re seeing and what your thoughts are with regards to nearline demand from your OEM customers that might go to the on-premise spending.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I would say, those are under pressure as well. I mean, I think across the whole data center business, we see pressure on that part of the market, both from the OEM side and the hyperscalers. I would say the hyperscaler is a little more severe correction, but we\u2019re seeing pressure on both sides of the data center business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss the run rate level of OpEx for the next few quarters. And as you address that question, how much of the $70 million improvement this quarter is from the 40% reduction in hard drive capacity versus changes in accounting for R&D in NAND? As well as, could you touch on your ability to redeploy heads in media production into cloud products where demand should grow very well on a structural basis going forward? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So with respect to the run rate of OpEx when you look at \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll talk a little bit about where we ended in Q1, because this is a bit relevant on how we think about it going forward. So in Q1 we saw an approximately $70 million to $80 million actually drop from the prior quarter. So we ended it around $689 million. We took action on variable expenses and non-discretionary spend. Basically we are tightening the \u2013 totally the expenses management. As we look forward for the next few quarters, the run rate is expected to be $650 million to $700 million. And we\u2019re still contemplating few other actions that may help us keep things even tighter. So that\u2019s the run rate. On the part of the question related to the client capacity restructuring, the OpEx does not reflect that. This mostly \u2013 the impact of that is mostly on the cost of goods sold. And with the reduction of approximately 40% of our capacity, we expect to see on an annual basis, roughly $45 million to $50 million benefit. So that\u2019s roughly speaking a little bit more than $10 million, let\u2019s call it around, $10 million to $12 million a quarter. In terms of the last part of the question on the heads and media, some of this capacity is fungible. And we can \u2013 part of our capital investment was to continue to invest in our heads and media to ensure we have the capacity to drive the \u2013 or supply the growth expected in the future. But as we talked about that, also we are managing our capital expenditures over the next few quarters to manage our cash.\nDavid Goeckeler: I think you\u2019ve got the headset right, which is in the transition from client to cloud, we move all the heads and media over to cloud. We\u2019ve been in that transition for a long time. We\u2019re very, very deep in that. I would say we\u2019re in the last stages of that transition. So simple thing with client drives have a lot more discs and heads in them and we use all that capacity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMark Miller: Thank you for the question. You saw a decline in cash in the current quarter and you\u2019re talking about negative free cash flow. Where do you think cash will be at the end of December quarter in the year?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So, I won\u2019t necessarily guide to a cash number, but we\u2019re expecting a negative free cash flow quarter in the calendar Q4. From a liquidity perspective, look, we ended the Q1 at $4.3 billion with around $2 billion of cash. And we still have $2.25 billion of revolver. And so from a liquidity perspective we\u2019re comfortable in the ability for us to continue to operate comfortably.\nMark Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Goeckeler for any closing remark.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right. Thanks everyone for joining us. Look, we\u2019ll be talking to all of you throughout the quarter. We appreciate your participation in the call. It\u2019s obviously a very dynamic environment we\u2019re all facing out there. Feel really good about the way we\u2019ve been navigating this. Hopefully we\u2019ve given you some good color about how we\u2019re thinking about the business going forward. Again, have a great day everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 first quarter results. I am pleased to see the Western Digital team work together to deliver revenue at the upper half of the guidance range in the midst of an incredibly dynamic and challenging macroeconomic environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $3.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income of $307 million. Our operating income performance was above the midpoint implied by our guidance and demonstrated our ability to actively respond and navigate this environment. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and included an approximately $0.30 impact due to higher than forecasted tax rate. Overall, the actions we have taken over the past few years are enabling us to manage through business cycle troughs more effectively and position the company to thrive as market conditions improve. These efforts have reinvigorated the Western Digital innovation engine and strengthened our product portfolio. In particular, we are leading the transition to SMR-based hard drives alongside our cloud customers, showcasing our product leadership. In flash, we have nearly tripled our bit shipments in the NVMe enterprise SSD product category as compared to the last down cycle, adding another large and growing end market in which we can allocate our flash bits. Our industry-leading innovation, diversified portfolio and broad go-to-market strategy across cloud, client and consumer end markets allow us to enjoy strong relationships with our customers and meet the full range of storage needs. The breadth of markets we address also offers us unique visibility into end market demand signals, which allowed us to recognize potential challenges to our business as they unfolded. We have proactively and effectively managed our business through weakening consumer demand by optimizing product mix and rightsizing our hard drive manufacturing footprint. As part of these efforts to manage through this part of the cycle, we are reducing our capital investments and operating expenses as we move to align our cash flow and cost structure with market conditions. Wissam will go over our efforts in more detail. As we closely monitor the macro environment, we are encouraged to see retail flash and channel demand leveling out and orders from PC customers stabilizing, a sign that consumer-led inventory correction is abating. We believe the long-term growth in flash demand, combined with reduced flash industry supply will restore supply and demand balance in the next couple of quarters. Before I jump into updates on our HD and Flash businesses, I want to provide a short update on our strategic review process. The executive committee of our Board, which I lead, continues its process, which I previously announced includes the participation of Elliott Management under a non-disclosure agreement. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today. We will provide updates as we have them. Now turning to our HDD business. During the first quarter, our HDD revenue declined modestly as we had forecasted in August. Sequentially, total HDD and nearline exabyte shipments were both flat. Continued momentum with U.S. cloud customers and accelerated adoption of SMR hard drives were offset by softness in other capacity enterprise product channels and consumer HDD demand. Shipment of capacity enterprise drives based on SMR technologies exceeded 25% of this category, one quarter ahead of our expectations. We now expect SMR to represent over 40% of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipment exiting fiscal year 2023. SMR adoption drove a 19% sequential and 21% year-over-year increase in average capacity to 17 terabytes per capacity enterprise drive, and our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments increased more than 150% sequentially. We are deep into the process of qualifying our latest generation of hard drives, including our 26 terabyte UltraSMR hard drives at multiple U.S. cloud and OEM customers. Interest in SMR from other hyperscalers worldwide is increasing as the 20% capacity gain offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide. Looking ahead, our U.S. cloud customers have started sharply reducing their hard drive inventory alongside other components for their data center build-outs. This, along with continued subdued demand across markets in China, will impact near-term demand over the next few quarters. Despite these near-term corrections, it is clear from our conversations with these customers that HDD products will be the foundational storage for their continued cloud build-out in the years to come. Our product leadership and innovation engine remain as strong as ever and we are confident that Western Digital's hard drive business will thrive over the long-term as demand improves and new products continue to ramp. Turning to flash. Revenue was slightly ahead of our expectations. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading brands, including WD Black, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional that are recognized globally for their cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. I'm pleased to say that we exceeded our bit shipment forecast this quarter. Our client SSD products for PC OEM, retail and mobile drove the upside in bit shipments. Average capacity per client SSD increased 24% sequentially and 54% year-over-year, driven by doubling of standard storage capacity for PCs sold by multiple OEMs. This is another reminder of the insatiable demand for data storage and the resilience of flash demand as price elasticity drives increased consumption per device. On the technology front, BiCS5 accelerated to over two thirds of our flash revenue in the September quarter, up from about half in the previous quarter. BiCS6 yield and development of subsequent 3D NAND flash are both progressing well. For the December quarter, we expect flash shipments to increase sequentially, led by seasonal strength in retail and mobile. With the abrupt change in market conditions, we are acting decisively to adjust our supply trajectory to align with demand. We are pushing out BiCS6 transition to meaningfully reduce our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 which may offer us a potential opportunity to leapfrog to a future BiCS technology node as demand normalizes. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our first quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the second quarter. Thanks, Wissam. Let me briefly wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. While near-term market conditions are challenging, digital transformation continues to drive long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With products and solutions that play in every part of the technology ecosystem, Western Digital can meet customers' needs across the spectrum and unlock the possibilities of data. For example, while we are successfully managing through the consumer-led downturn, which is showing signs of stabilization, we are ramping multiple new products into data centers worldwide. As we remain focused on innovation and execution, I am optimistic that Western Digital will emerge stronger as we continue to ramp multiple new products into data centers worldwide and market conditions improve. With our top-tier team innovative and diversified portfolio, broad customer base and differentiated go-to-market engine, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities stemming from the rapid global adoption of the cloud and the expansive and growing ecosystem it supports. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their hard work during this quarter and for solidifying our leadership in storage. In the face of an extremely challenging macro environment, our team worked together to deliver solid financial performance for Western Digital. I'm proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in calendar 2023 and beyond. All right, Peter. With that, let's open it up for Q&A. Yes, Aaron, good morning. And thanks for the question. We have not taken any major underutilization actions in the fab. We always reserve that right in the future, depending on market conditions. So when we look at our \u2013 the way to think about Q4, and I'll invite calendar Q4, Wissam, obviously, make some comments. I mean we're still under a \u2013 pricing is still under pressure. I think that's fairly clear what's going on in the market. And then we've got a sequential increase, slight increase in bit shipments. So think that's one way to think about how we're thinking about the quarter. Wissam, anything to add? Yes, we're going to \u2013 you've got it. We're going to see a sharp decline in shipments in calendar Q4 and that's going to lead to some pretty significant absorption charges or underutilization charges. And then will grow back out of that as we move into \u2013 as we move through 2023. Good morning. So I think this is \u2013 the strategy we've been executing over the last couple of years and what we've been talking about, I think, is really paying off for us now at this part of the cycle. We've worked very hard to drive the portfolio abroad and deep portfolio across consumer, across mobile. We obviously still stay qualified at all the vendors, the client SSD portfolio is an anchor of the portfolio, gaming. And now we've added enterprise SSD into the mix. So we've always talked about \u2013 we want to have a broad portfolio to be qualified everywhere we can. And then be able to mix based on what gets us to the best return. And so I think at this part of the cycle, we're able to do that. And it also gives us quite a few homes for our supply. So that allows us in a tough quarter, have sequential bit growth. Obviously, pricing is market-based pricing. So we participate in the market and it allows us to basically just change the mix to get the best return we can. So again, I think the portfolio strategy we've been pursuing and we've been talking about getting qualified at the hyperscalers on enterprise SSD, and that is \u2013 that gives us another really important home for our supply. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think when you look across the portfolio, we have five or six categories, depending on the quarter, if you look at it for the whole fiscal year, we'll have six different categories where we have a double-digit mix of bits going into those different parts of the market. So I think it gives us a lot of optionality and the ability to generate the best return we can. Yes. I think the way we think about it right now, BiCS6 is \u2013 we're taking the actions around capital investment to slow down our bit supply in the market to try and get the market balance. I think everybody is doing that. There's really an enormous number of actions to try and get the market back in balance. We feel good about those. We'll take effect next year as we move through the year. What it means for us is BiCS6 will be a shorter node. At this point, the follow-on node BiCS8 is progressing very, very well. And as we move through the year, we'll be able to make a judgment about how long we're going to stay on which node. There's a number of issues around qualifications of products and all those kinds of things. So we'll make thoughtful decisions about that when we get closer to that point as we move through 2023. But we feel very good about where both nodes are and how they're progressing and that will give us the \u2013 give us, again, more optionality about how we think about what products we put in the market to get us the best financial return and obviously, the best solution for our customers. Joe, and just to add to that, I mean, we're thinking about how you are. I mean, look, we've got a \u2013 we've got to get through this phase of the cycle. I think there's been a lot of discussion about everything from reduced utilization to pushing out CapEx. To your point, there are some regulations that are going to impact supply in the market in 2023. So we're optimistic about the next cycle about getting there. The market is all the \u2013 we're reacting strongly to get supply and demand back in balance. But we \u2013 as Wissam said, we've invested in our balance sheet \u2013 we've invested in innovation in our portfolio to build the resiliency and the agility in the business to manage through this. No, it's \u2013 on the second part of your question, it's not because of that at all. It's because we have a lot of homes for our supply, and we're able to get, we think, a good economic return for that. So from \u2013 just purely from an economic point of view, it makes sense for us to continue to build the supply. We're definitely going to slow down our bit supply. I think you can think like low to mid-20s for supply next year is kind of the way we're thinking about it. So let me take the first part, and I'll ask Wissam to comment on inventory. If we go back and we look at kind of the progression of what's happened this year. Back in March, we \u2013 roughly the March time frame, we saw the consumer market come under pressure. We talked a lot about that. In let's call it, the June time frame, we saw the PC OEMs really start adjusting their inventory very aggressively. We talked about that last quarter. And we've seen that play out during the quarter now in a number of different fronts. And then just within the last month or two, we've started to see the big data center operators do the same thing, really sharply adjust their inventory. And obviously, that's factored into our guide. So we've seen this kind of rolling change as it goes through one market to the next. If you look at the other side of it, where are they at in that process, consumer market, we're seeing relatively predictable behavior, it's not like it's at a great point, but it's not falling the way it was, our ability to predict where it's going to be week-over-week and month-over-month have increased. And so we've got more confidence we understand where that market is at and how it's going to play out going forward. In the PC market and see Q4, we're actually going to see some sequential growth in units of client SSD, not a huge amount, but it's sequential growth. Again, we talked about a very, very sharp inventory correction. So we're starting to see \u2013 we're getting to the point there where the inventory correction last quarter was quite severe. I mean, when customers going down to less than 10% of their usual demand. Now we see things coming back and stabilizing a little bit. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that things are back up and back up and to the right, but they're stabilizing a bit, and we're starting to see some signs that we're getting more predictable behavior and then that we can then grow out at this point. Obviously, the data center, the big U.S. hyperscalers were just kind of going into that. And we'll have more to say as we \u2013 it's going to be a couple of quarters, but we'll have more to say as we go through the quarter of what we're seeing and then what we see going into next quarter. Inventory? Yes. On NAND cost, when we went through the CapEx exercise, we obviously kept a very close eye on still being able to drive cost declines. It's a very important element of the whole model of what we're doing here. So we're still comfortable with you modeling 15% year-over-year cost declines. I mean, clearly, there'll be some variability from quarter-to-quarter, but we still target that 15% year-over-year. It's a big part \u2013 I've talked about this a lot in the past. It's an actual input into the process, into the design process, not an output. And so we really designed to meet that, and it's a strong part of what we're \u2013 what the whole business is about. HDD margins will be under pressure next quarter. We will have \u2013 as I said before, we'll have some significant underutilization costs that will go into the financials \u2013 the other side of that is pricing in nearline and capacity enterprise has been stable benign about what we expect. But we're clearly going to have to \u2013 we're going to slow down production significantly, and that will hit us in the margin line next quarter. And then we'll grow out of that as volume comes back. And as we go through 2023, we also feel very \u2013 we feel very good that we're going to be ramping into the 22-terabyte drive, which is deep in qualification at a lot of different places around the world. And also the 26-terabyte UltraSMR drive is in qualification as well. And we talked a lot about SMR in the prepared remarks, that is a technology we believe very strongly. That's the next phase of the data center is SMR. And it was \u2013 just last quarter, we talked about ending the year with 25% of our exabytes in that market being SMR, we achieved that a quarter early. And now we expect to exit the fiscal year with over 40% of our exabytes being shipped on SMR. So I feel really good about where the portfolio is. And as we grow out of this sharp inventory correction through 2023, we'll be going into strength in the product road map. Pricing in HTD has been something we've been very much focused on. We feel very, very positive about the innovation we're bringing to market. I mean, that's where all \u2013 everything about pricing starts with innovation. You got to bring a great product to market. You got to continue to drive a better value proposition for our customers. And we believe strongly we're doing that. These new drives have very good TCO benefits for our \u2013 the largest data center operators in the world. So pricing in nearline has been, I think benign is the word I've used for many quarters now, and I would continue to use that word. And we're going to be focused on value-based pricing as we ramp into 22 and 26. So that's the way we're thinking about it. Again, it's all about driving a better TCO value proposition through innovation, and then we get to share that benefit of that with our customers. In NAND pricing has clearly been under pressure. I think that's very well documented. As I said before that look at our pricing last quarter, like for like for like minus 17%, blended minus 22%, we're clearly mixing this \u2013 the mix hurts the pricing a bit, but it also allows us to move a lot of supply. And we think it's the right \u2013 we think it's the right decision for the business. We expect pricing to be under pressure in calendar Q4 as well. Yes. We don't talk about specific customers. But what I can say is there's multiple, very large customers committed to SMR, some of the largest data center operators in the world. And I think the whole industry is especially UltraSMR. I mean, SMR has been around a long time, right? SMR has been shipped and client drives for a long time, but it actually requires some work on the host side for the data center operators. So when we were able to introduce UltraSMR and get plus 20% on a CMR drive versus the industry standard of plus 10% that really changed the equation a bit. And when you can get 20% capacity uplift, it's worth the investment on the host site. And we're seeing that \u2013 we're seeing that move across a lot of operators be very interested in that. So we don't break out specific customers. I said on an exabyte basis, we expect it to be over 40% exiting the fiscal year. I think you can assume on a revenue basis, it'll be slightly more than that. But I think that's how we think about it. All right, let me \u2013 I'll make some comments here and then I'm sure Wissam will probably have something to add as well. So first of all, let's clarify the comment on gross margin. There is no minimum gross margin. I think the comment was that in the last down cycle, the company's gross margin bottomed at 19% in flash. I will note that that number did not include the underutilization charges. And when you include the underutilization charges, Wissam, I know we calculated this number. Low teens, okay. So I think that was just a \u2013 Mehdi, I just think that was a benchmark that one of the previous questioners was using. So you're right about how we get the \u2013 how the JV economics work. But again, our \u2013 the way we think about the portfolio is if we can get the \u2013 if we can \u2013 if we have a home for the bits, that's number of \u2013 that's the first thing like, do we have a place where we can \u2013 do we have customers that value our innovation in our portfolio and we have a place to put the supply and then we look at pricing and then we look at that equation and does it make economic sense to do that and we drive the portfolio. We're actually given where we are in the cycle, we're pleased with the gross margin we're able to drive in the business at this point. So that's how we're thinking about it. Exabyte growth, I mean, clearly we're going to slow down ACD exabyte growth. I think this \u2013 that the industry is going through a pretty large digestion cycle. Part of the CapEx pushout that we saw them talked about, the lion share of that is on the flash side of the business. But we're also moving out ACD CapEx as well to slow down our exabyte growth there. We have a lot of conviction that the market's still going to grow in that high 20, 30 plus range on exabyte growth, but we're going to have to grow back into that as we go through this inventory correction. Good morning. Yes. I would say, those are under pressure as well. I mean, I think across the whole data center business, we see pressure on that part of the market, both from the OEM side and the hyperscalers. I would say the hyperscaler is a little more severe correction, but we're seeing pressure on both sides of the data center business. I think you've got the headset right, which is in the transition from client to cloud, we move all the heads and media over to cloud. We've been in that transition for a long time. We're very, very deep in that. I would say we're in the last stages of that transition. So simple thing with client drives have a lot more discs and heads in them and we use all that capacity. All right. Thanks everyone for joining us. Look, we'll be talking to all of you throughout the quarter. We appreciate your participation in the call. It's obviously a very dynamic environment we're all facing out there. Feel really good about the way we've been navigating this. Hopefully we've given you some good color about how we're thinking about the business going forward. Again, have a great day everyone. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, revenue was in line, thanks to our team's agility and resilience in managing through this dynamic environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 17% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and, as David mentioned, included an approximately $0.30 impact due to the higher than forecasted tax rate. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 49% of revenue at $1.8 billion, down 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, continued momentum in capacity enterprise drives sold to U.S. cloud customers and an increase in smart video hard drive demand partly offset the decline in all other hard drive product channels and flash. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments were flat at 112 exabytes, driven by our success in leading the industry transition to SMR hard drives. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline across both hard drive and flash products. Clients represented 33% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 25% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was attributed to flash driven by inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower pricing. The year-over-year decline resulted primarily from the reduced flash pricing. Lastly, consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.7 billion, down 15% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the revenue decline was due to flash pricing and lower retail HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $2 billion, down 5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, total HDD exabyte shipments increased by 1% and average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $125. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 12% and average price per unit increased by 23%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 28% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Sequentially, flash ASPs were down 22% on a blended basis and 17% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 10% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 26.7%, down 5.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 28.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down 2.4 percentage points year-over-year. Our flash gross margin was 24.5%, down 11.4 percentage points sequentially and 12.5 percentage points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $689 million, down $71 million sequentially and below our guidance range due to lower variable expenses and tighter expense management, including reduction of discretionary spending. Operating income was $307 million, representing a 56% decrease from the prior quarter and a 68% decrease year-over-year. As David mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered operating income above the midpoint implied by our guidance in a challenging market backdrop. Our tax expense was $168 million, resulting in a tax rate of 72% higher than previously forecasted. Tax expense is influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was $0.20 compared to $1.78 in the prior quarter and $2.49 in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $6 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $215 million. Cash capital expenditures, which includes the purchase of property, plant, equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $221 million. Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $4.1 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.7x compared to 2x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. Before I go over guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I would like to discuss the business outlook for the balance of this fiscal year and the actions we are taking to align our execution plan with the changes in business environment. In flash, we expect shipments to increase sequentially in the fiscal second quarter and the balance of the fiscal year 2023 as the market stabilizes. In HDD, we expect our revenue to recover as our U.S. cloud customers reduced their inventories over the next two quarters. On the manufacturing front, we have sharply reduced client hard drive production capacity by approximately 40%. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to $2.7 billion. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure by 20% versus our prior expectation. The main drivers of our lower capital expenditures are primarily the push out of BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investments in hard drive manufacturing. As for our operating expenses, we proactively reduced our spending by approximately $80 million in the first fiscal quarter relative to the midpoint of the guidance range. We are also taking further action to lower our ongoing operating expenses range to $650 million to $700 million as we navigate this dynamic environment. We believe these actions we are taking will allow us to continue to invest in innovation as a top priority for our company going forward. For the fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 20% and 22%. We expect operating expenses to be between $650 million and $670 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $80 million. We expect the tax benefit between $70 million and $90 million. We expect loss per share of $0.25 to earnings per share of $0.05 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Yes. The only thing \u2013 I mean, I think the only thing I would add, David, is yes, pricing is pretty much what's going to be the main driver of gross margin in the calendar Q4. Yes. Good morning, Joe, thanks for the question. So with respect to the first part of your question, look, we're \u2013 we entered this down cycle in a very much stronger financial position than the previous one. If you recall, we reduced our debt by $2.7 billion. We've improved the earnings power of the business. We strengthened our portfolio. And also, if you look at our liquidity at the end of Q1, we had around $4.3 billion between a little bit more than $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and the $2.25 billion revolver that's undrawn. So we have ample liquidity to operate within the \u2013 in the next few quarters. And from where we are now, we're very comfortable in terms of the continued profitability of the business. Yes. And on the second part of the question, Wamsi. In Q1, we saw approximately a couple of hundred million dollars of growth in inventory at the end of the quarter. Our days of inventory were at 128. We're expecting to see a similar type of trends in the calendar Q4, roughly speaking, let's say, $100 million to $200 million growth and a bit of an increase in our days of inventory. Yes. We're in the sort of let's say between the \u2013 it's in the low teens. So let me take the question. So with respect to inventory in the September quarter the majority of the inventory growth was in NAND. On the HDD side, we were mostly flattish. As we look into the December quarter, we're expecting to continue to see more NAND inventory growth and there will be some HDD inventory growth, but not as much as we are anticipating to see NAND growth there. And the HDD growth will be basically just driven by the weakness we're seeing in the market. But also we will \u2013 we're carefully managing our utilization. They will be under absorption costs. We're also trying to carefully manage our utilization going forward. And in terms of the \u2013 the part of the question with respect to holding shipments no, we're not planning to hold shipments. Yes. The transition is primarily driven by mix. That's a key driver for HDD. Yes. So on the comment with respect to underutilization, yes, from where we stand today, this seems to be where we see probably underutilization at its lowest. And we would start getting ourselves out of that as demand improves. With respect to CapEx, we are aiming to reduce our cash CapEx for the fiscal year by 20%. Ideally we want to do more. The way to think of it is in our cash CapEx the 20% is roughly split around the 30% reduction with respect \u2013 and these are relative to our previous expectations. So 30% lower than previously expected on the NAND side. And on the HTD side, it's a reduction of 10% to 15% relative to the previous expectations. Yes. So Sidney, for free cash flow, we're projecting a negative free cash flow in the December quarter and for the fiscal year. Keep in mind that we have the IRS settlement payment that is still projected to be in the fiscal 2023. And this was estimated at $600 million to $700 million. With respect to inventory, look, we did see a small impact in terms of write-down in the September quarter. Ultimately, it all depends on how the net pricing develops in the next few quarters. So it's difficult to predict at this time, but it will depend on where the net pricing progresses. Yes. So with respect to the run rate of OpEx when you look at \u2013 maybe I'll talk a little bit about where we ended in Q1, because this is a bit relevant on how we think about it going forward. So in Q1 we saw an approximately $70 million to $80 million actually drop from the prior quarter. So we ended it around $689 million. We took action on variable expenses and non-discretionary spend. Basically we are tightening the \u2013 totally the expenses management. As we look forward for the next few quarters, the run rate is expected to be $650 million to $700 million. And we're still contemplating few other actions that may help us keep things even tighter. So that's the run rate. On the part of the question related to the client capacity restructuring, the OpEx does not reflect that. This mostly \u2013 the impact of that is mostly on the cost of goods sold. And with the reduction of approximately 40% of our capacity, we expect to see on an annual basis, roughly $45 million to $50 million benefit. So that's roughly speaking a little bit more than $10 million, let's call it around, $10 million to $12 million a quarter. In terms of the last part of the question on the heads and media, some of this capacity is fungible. And we can \u2013 part of our capital investment was to continue to invest in our heads and media to ensure we have the capacity to drive the \u2013 or supply the growth expected in the future. But as we talked about that, also we are managing our capital expenditures over the next few quarters to manage our cash. Yes. So, I won't necessarily guide to a cash number, but we're expecting a negative free cash flow quarter in the calendar Q4. From a liquidity perspective, look, we ended the Q1 at $4.3 billion with around $2 billion of cash. And we still have $2.25 billion of revolver. And so from a liquidity perspective we're comfortable in the ability for us to continue to operate comfortably."

Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon management's current assumptions and expectations and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 performance. Western Digital delivered strong results with fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $3.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 36.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44. For the fiscal year 2024, revenue totaled $13 billion. We have maintained our strategic focus on aligning our portfolio of industry-leading products with growth opportunities across a broad range of end markets to mitigate volatility while structurally improving our through-cycle profitability for both Flash and HDD. Before we discuss our performance, I want to provide our views on where the storage market is heading and how we are well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Our diverse portfolio, coupled with the structural changes we have made to strengthen our operations, is enabling us to benefit from the broad recovery we are beginning to see across our end markets. In addition, the AI Data Cycle is increasing the need for storage and creating new demand drivers across both Flash and HDD. These AI systems process and analyze existing data, generate new data and require substantial storage for training, operating in a continuous cycle of increasing data consumption, processing and generation. As AI technologies advance, data storage systems must deliver the capacity and performance necessary to support the computational demands of large sophisticated models while managing vast volumes of data. Given this landscape, we expect Flash to benefit from both AI training and inference while HDD is poised to benefit at both the input and output stages of these AI models. To address the growing performance, power and capacity requirements, we have developed our Flash and HDD product road maps to meet our end customer storage needs across the entire AI Data Cycle. We introduced the industry-leading high-performance PCIe Gen 5 SSD to support AI training and inference. A high-capacity 64 terabyte SSD for optimizing the build-out of rapid AI data lakes in the world's highest capacity ePMR UltraSMR 32-terabyte hard drive for cost effective and deep content storage at scale. These new offerings demonstrate our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. As we enter fiscal year 2025, we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities in data storage and believe the AI Data Cycle will be a significant incremental growth driver for the storage industry. Before I dive further into business updates, I want to update you on our separation plans. I am pleased with the progress our team has made as we continue to drive to completing the work required to separate the company at the end of the calendar year. As part of the ongoing preparation for the separation, we anticipate beginning to incur separation dis-synergy costs in the second half of the calendar year. Wissam will briefly discuss the anticipated impact of these costs. I'll now turn to business updates. Starting with Flash, the growth in revenue was driven by the recovery in cloud and a shift of our client mix to gaming and mobile, partially offset by a decline in consumer. Our focus on driving higher through-cycle profitability is reflected in our results as we proactively mix bits across our end markets. Our innovative offerings remain at the forefront of the market, reinforcing our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. For example, our new QLC-based client SSDs which grew 50% on a sequential exabyte basis, offer significantly better performance than our previous generation TLC products. Combining this high-performance node with our in-house controller development, enable us to provide a portfolio of client SSDs that deliver unmatched performance and value. We believe these products will lead the industry's transition to QLC flash. During our New Era of NAND webinar last month, we introduced the world's highest capacity BiCS8 2-terabyte QLC memory die, specifically designed to meet growing data center and AI storage needs. Built on a chip bonded to array architecture, BiCS8 reinforces Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost and capital efficiency as well as superior I/O performance by integrating wafer bonding in advanced 3D manufacturing to establish a ground-breaking foundation for future scalability of 3D NAND. In addition, our 64 terabyte enterprise SSD is now being sampled with plans for volume shipment later this calendar year. Furthermore, our PCIe Gen 5 based enterprise SSD delivers best-in-class read performance as well as power efficiency. We are seeing significant interest in this product which is currently qualifying at a hyperscaler with ramp expected in the second half of this calendar year. We'll talk more about our Flash road map at the upcoming Flash Memory Summit in early August. Turning to the Flash outlook. Throughout the fourth quarter, our product mix was dynamic as we proactively mix bits between our end markets in response to the softness we are seeing in the more transactional markets such as consumer and channel. Our success in identifying the most profitable approach to allocating bits is reflected in the growth of both our revenue and gross margin. As we look into the first quarter, in addition to the mix environment we saw in the fourth quarter, we expect the continued ramp of our new enterprise SSD offerings and seasonal strength in mobile to drive mid- to high-teens bit growth on a sequential basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect enterprise SSDs to represent a double-digit percent share in our portfolio mix. The new era of NAND is driving a period of change and we are going to remain disciplined in managing our capital spending. The layers focus race is behind us. The emphasis is now shifting towards strategically timing the economic introduction of new longer-lasting nodes. Innovation now means enhancing power efficiency, performance and capacity within these nodes, while capital decisions increasingly prioritize opportunities for margin expansion and revenue growth. Turning to HDD; revenue growth was driven by strength in nearline demand and improved pricing. By leveraging our SMR leadership and lean cost structure, we have surpassed our target gross margin range, underscoring our ongoing commitment to improve future profitability. The HDD business has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent quarters, marked by strategic initiatives aimed at introducing the most innovative, high-capacity products to market. We have increased our profitability meaningfully by restructuring our manufacturing footprint and optimizing our cost structure to drive operational efficiency. All while qualifying and ramping our SMR technology. We continue to structurally change the way we are operating our HDD business. With better visibility into future demand, operational excellence and a commitment to sustaining supply-demand balance, we are poised to continue our trajectory of bringing highly innovative products to market while increasing profitability into the future. On the technology front, we ship samples of our 32-terabyte UltraSMR/ePMR nearline hard drives to select customers. These drives feature advanced triple-stage actuators and OptiNAND technology which are designed for seamless qualification, integration and deployment in hyperscale cloud and enterprise data centers while maintaining exceptional reliability. With this in mind, we are well positioned to deliver the industry's highest capacity hard drives and the best TCO. Turning to the HDD outlook. As we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect further growth driven by greater demand and more favorable pricing. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR and we anticipate a third major cloud vendor to begin the ramp of adopting SMR in the fiscal first quarter. Our leading products and lean cost structure have supported ongoing profitability improvements in our HDD business. We remain focused on driving higher margins to reflect the significant innovation and TCO improvements we deliver to our customers. Our strategic approach to commercializing ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies has proven to be the winning strategy, enabling us to surpass our gross margin target for HDDs in the midst of AI's emergence as another pivotal growth driver for the industry. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, David. And good afternoon, everyone. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Western Digital delivered great results with gross margin and earnings per share exceeding the high end of the guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 9% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.44. Looking at end markets, Cloud represented 50% of total revenue at $1.9 billion. The sequential growth of 21% is attributed to higher nearline shipments and pricing in HDD, coupled with increased bit shipments and pricing in enterprise SSD. The 89% year-over-year increase was due to higher shipments and price per unit in nearline HDDs along with higher enterprise SSD bit shipments. Nearline bit shipments were at a record level of 125 exabytes, up 16% from the previous quarter and 113% compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Client represented 32% of total revenue at $1.2 billion. The sequential increase of 3% was due to the increase in flash ASPs, offsetting a decline in flash bit shipments while HDD revenue decreased slightly. The 16% year-over-year growth was driven by higher flash ASPs. Consumer represented 18% of total revenue at $0.7 billion. Sequentially, the 7% decrease was due to lower flash and HDD bit shipments, partially offset by higher ASPs in both flash and HDD. The 5% year-over-year increase was driven by improved flash ASPs and bit shipments. For fiscal year 2024, revenue was $13 billion, up 6% from fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 22.8% and non-GAAP operating margin increased 8.7 percentage points to 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.20. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2024, Cloud revenue increased 2% year-over-year due to higher demand for capacity enterprise HDDs and improved pricing. For the year, client and consumer revenue grew by 7% and 9%, respectively, due to higher flash bit shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Compared to last year -- last quarter, Flash ASPs were up 14% on a blended basis and 11% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 7% sequentially and 3% compared to last year as we proactively mixed Flash bits to maximize profitability. HDD revenue was $2 billion, up 14% from last quarter as exabyte shipments increased 12% and average price per unit increased 12% to $163. Compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 55%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 72% and 64%, respectively. Moving to the rest of the income statement. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Our focus on improving through-cycle profitability in both Flash and HDD has shown great progress. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin reached 36.3% well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved by 7 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing and cost reduction as well as higher volume. Within Flash, by proactively allocating bits between end markets and executing on our cost reduction initiatives, we have improved gross margin for 4 consecutive quarters. Flash gross margin was 36.5%, up 9.1 percentage points compared to last quarter and 48.4 percentage points year-over-year. In HDD, by offering a leading product portfolio and running efficient manufacturing operations focused on cost discipline, we continue to make progress in improving profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 36.1%, exceeding the long-term target range, up 5 percentage points sequentially and 15.4 percentage points compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Operating expenses were $700 million for the quarter, above our guided range, primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected profitability. Operating income was $666 million, tax expense was $17 million, earnings per share was $1.44. Operating cash flow was $366 million and free cash flow was $282 million. Cash capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. For fiscal year 2024, cash capital expenditures were $244 million or 1.9% of revenue, excluding the proceeds from the sale leaseback of our Milpitas facility. Year-over-year, this represented a 69% decline. Fourth quarter inventory was up from the prior quarter at $3.3 billion. With days of inventory increasing from 119 days to 126 days. A decline in HDD inventory was more than offset by an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.5 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion and total liquidity was $4.1 billion including undrawn revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. I'll now turn to the fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance. We anticipate both Flash and HDD revenue and gross margin to improve on a sequential basis as we continue to drive improvements in profitability across our businesses. We anticipate revenue to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $695 million to $715 million. A decrease in variable compensation will be offset by the synergy costs as we continue to make progress executing on the separation plans. Included in this range are dis-synergy costs of $15 million to $25 million. We expect the synergy costs in the fiscal second quarter to be between $35 million and $45 million. Interest and expenses are anticipated to be approximately $110 million. Tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 17%. We expect earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.85 based on approximately 360 million shares outstanding. As shown in our guidance, we remain committed to driving higher profitability while maintaining focus on cost and capital discipline. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Today's results and guidance underscore Western Digital's strong execution with promising growth opportunities ahead. We delivered solid results as we doubled down on our strategic initiatives and product road map, capitalizing on robust growth prospects for both Flash and HDD. The emergence of the AI Data Cycle marks an incredibly exciting transformation in our industry, driving fundamental shifts across our end markets. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25 we are well positioned to leverage our leadership positions to spearhead innovative technologies and deliver unparalleled value for our customers. Peter, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nC.J. Muse: I guess I would like to focus my question around HDD gross margins, truly impressive outlook in the actual results. I was hoping you could speak to your contracted supply today, your pricing visibility into the second half of the calendar year and whether that extends into calendar '25. And as part of that, how we should think about the progression of HDD gross margins as we go into September, December and beyond.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Sure. Thanks, C.J. So yes, we were very happy with where the HDD business is at. We've -- we spent a long time focused on getting our manufacturing footprint in the right spot and a lot of cost optimization there now that the volume ramps back, it puts us in a strong position plus the products, right? The continued strong adoption of UltraSMR, those drives are great for us. They're great for our customers. They're leading capacity points. So when you put it all together, we were able to deliver past our gross margin target in that business. Some of the historians around here tell me it's like the best gross margin ever. And the good news, as you said, is it's going higher. So we got good supply-demand balance that's giving us good visibility throughout the rest of the calendar year, we're -- we pretty much know where every drive is going to go. At this point, we made, I think, a really significant transition this past quarter and that we moved up our request to our customers to give us visibility 52 weeks ahead, so a 52-week lead time on HDDs. Now the reason that's so important is the cycle time underneath to build an HDD is about 50 weeks. So we've been working very hard to drive the technology, drive our manufacturing but also change the business practices of this business to give us the visibility that allows us to really align our investment with our customer demand. Our customers have responded well to that request and we now have visibility for the entire fiscal year from a number of our biggest customers. Others are still -- we're still working through it with them. But to wrap it all up, we're -- we're very happy with where the margins are. We continue to see margins going higher in this business as we continue to innovate. If we continue to innovate, deliver better TCO to our customers, we're going to continue to drive margins higher and we've got a very robust road map to do that. And we're now getting the visibility in place to -- in the business practices to make sure we can keep supply and demand balance going far into the future. So hopefully, that addresses your question.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: I wanted to ask about NAND and this kind of -- you have weaker volume in Q2 but good pricing. And we're seeing that everywhere that the volumes are sort of disappointing but the pricing has still been good. And usually, you sort of think about needing good demand for pricing to go up. So can you just talk about that dynamic? And what do you think happens over the back half of the year with supply and demand for NAND.\nDavid Goeckeler: As you know, Joe, it's a very dynamic market. So we're still seeing -- in the negotiated markets, we're still seeing good pricing increases, especially enterprise SSD and that's something we're very excited about. We see -- we saw really good sequential growth in enterprise SSD and we're expecting very good sequential growth in the next quarter. Some of the more transactional markets where you have more players involved and frankly, some players that don't produce their own raw NAND, pricing is a little more dynamic and demand in general in consumer is a little bit weak. So in those markets, we see a little more demand headwind, a little more -- not quite as aggressive as pricing moves but in the negotiated markets, we still see good pricing. And then, you put mix all on top of that to come up with a quarter-by-quarter number where you got quite a bit of variability. But as we go through the back half of the year, we continue to see strong demand in Enterprise SSD. We see the PC market really kind of maybe a little bit of an inventory rebalancing here going on in the next quarter but we see that improving as we go throughout the year. I think that's a normal process given a couple of really strong quarters here in the first part of the recovery of NAND pricing. So we still see demand outstripping supply through the second half of the year. And quite frankly, our modeling shows throughout next calendar year as well.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\nGrant Joslin: This is Grant Joslin on for Tim Arcuri. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you view the balance sheet and how you want to prioritize the free cash flow generated between now and the separation? And any updated thoughts on the appropriate leverage for each of the 2 segments?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, sure. As I noted in the prepared remarks, in Q4, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. And so as we generate cash, our focus is to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. The -- with respect to the second part of the question related to question related to the capital structure. Obviously, we're making good progress as we prepare for the separation, we will be as -- we get closer to the time of the separation, will be hosting Capital Market Days or Investor Days to discuss that in more detail. But as we've always said, our aim is to create 2 world-class companies that are competitive in their own spaces. And so their cap structures would be reflecting their -- the profile from a profitability, cash generation and market dynamics as well.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. One clarification I just want to throw out there. Is the dis-synergy costs all in operating expenses? Or is there anything in COGS? And then from a question perspective. When I look at the NAND business and I think you guys talked about in the prepared remarks of growing kind of mid- to high teens sequentially on a capacity ship basis this next quarter. I guess where my math leads me is to think that your underlying assumption would be maybe more of a flattish ASP trend in the September quarter. I guess my question is, is that kind of how you're thinking about that? And if so, why would we think that pricing would be flattish? Is there a mix dynamic, something that we should consider in that?\nDavid Goeckeler: I'll take the second part of the question. Kind of remember the first part now.\nWissam Jabre: Let me take the first part related to the dis-synergy costs. The question was whether they were split -- they were all in operating expenses or there's anything in COGS. So Aaron, the numbers that I quoted, the $15 million to $25 million are all in operating expenses. There will be some dis-synergy costs in the COGS but they're really not material. And so that's why we didn't call them out. And they're reflected also in our guidance for Q1.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. And Aaron, on the NAND pricing, I think you kind of answered your question as you went through there, just to confirm it. There's a huge mix dynamic. So we've got -- like everybody else, we're seeing some weakness in the consumer. And so that's -- consumer is 1/3 of our Flash portfolio. So that's a big business and that has very we've always talked about higher than average through-cycle margins. So that's a bit of a headwind. And then we -- it's a seasonally strong quarter for mobile. So that's -- there's a big mix dynamic there as well. So that -- but you're thinking about it the right way.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.\nKarl Ackerman: One clarification question and a question, if I may. For my clarification question, is the PCIe Gen 5 Enterprise SSD at a hyperscaler separate or in addition to your sampling of 64 terabyte SSDs in the second half of this calendar year? I guess as you address that question, could you speak to the breadth of customer design wins you have on enterprise SSDs which are indicative of your growing share of SSD relative to your overall portfolio mix.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. They are 2 separate products targeted to different parts of the AI Data Cycle. So the compute product that you mentioned, what we call a compute product because it's designed to feed data into GPUs and keep the pipeline full. So very high performance, very high-performance NAND. That product is a qualification in a hyperscaler and we're getting a lot of interest in that product across the AI ecosystem of anybody that's building an AI training infrastructure because we believe that product is the best read performance and really good power efficiency and that's what everybody is looking for in that market. The 64 terabyte drive is a separate product that's targeted at building these high-performance data lakes for AI training and we're looking at that across the kind of same sort of customers. Anybody that's building an AI training infrastructure is looking for those kind of products. And that's in addition to the products we had qualified enterprise SSD, we had qualified 2 or 3 of the hyperscalers before the downturn and those products are picking back up now as well. So we have a much -- we were -- we were happy with the portfolio and now we keep adding to it. And those products are really well targeted to where the demand is in enterprise SSD which is a lot of pull on people building AI training infrastructure.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Eddy [ph] for Krish. Two-part question, if I may. On nearline HDD congrats on great progress there. This is the second quarter of above 50% market share for you guys versus historically your share being in the low 40s. I wonder if you think this has anything to do with your main peer transitioning from PMR to HAMR? Or do you think this is more tied to specific customer exposure? And also, I wonder if you think you'd have that capacity within fiscal '25, given that your exabyte shipments are at all-time high.\nDavid Goeckeler: We know -- we think that the share in our products is because they are great products, right? We're delivering the highest TCO products. We've had this road map for a long time. None of our customers are surprised by our road map. They know about our road map, quite frankly, years in advance and we work with them very closely. So we believe we're providing the highest capacity -- well, we are providing the highest capacity drives at scale. They're easily qualified. The architecture is well known to our customers. and they deliver absolutely the best TCO. And if you're building a data center architecture at the scale our customers do, TCO is incredibly important. And now we've delivered a 32-terabyte drive. First time anybody has crossed the 30 terabyte at scale, that's sampling really great TCO. And then the UltraSMR side of it, these drives can deliver 20% more capacity with UltraSMR versus a typical SMR drive which is 10% more capacity that's great for our customers. They get more capacity per unit. It's great for us because we get 20% more capacity or the incremental 10% without adding any COGS to the system, so that's margin accretive. That's very nice. And we're seeing now the third hyperscaler starting to adopt our UltraSMR technology starting in the second half of the year. So we just feel really good where the portfolio is. We think this portfolio has been in development for decades to get to this point. These were decisions that were made a long time ago given the lead times in this business. And so we believe we're -- customers are just responding to great products. And the TCO increases in the supply-demand balance allow us to also work on the pricing side of it as well. So as far as capacity, look, I mentioned it earlier, we got to this 52-week lead time that was really important because now we're starting to get forecast from our customers a year out. It gives us the ability to plan for capacity. So as we get -- as those forecasts come in and we roll them up and we work with our customers and we look at that, what that picture looks like, then we'll be in a position to address this issue of do we add capacity. But we don't want -- we're not going to add capacity for a 2-quarter increase in volume. We think this is much more sustained than that. As I talked about, AI is going to be a big driver -- the AI Data Cycle will be a big driver for HDDs as well. We see sustained demand into the future. But we want to see the commitments from our customers and them to give us that visibility and we now have that in place. And as we get the whole market, all of our customers looking at that over the next quarter or so, we'll have a better I think a better way to answer that question of do we plan to add capacity. But for right now, we're happy with where our capacity is. and what we're able to ship and mix keeps going up and we're able to ship more exabytes per quarter based on mix.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess maybe just focusing on the HDD side again. I think the fear everyone is going to have is, are you sitting at close to peak performance at this point, both from how much exabyte you are shipping versus the last week which I think within 10 exabytes of that? And where the gross margins are. So maybe if you can just focus on gross margins up. Can you just talk about what is the right way to think about HDD gross margins assuming exabytes keep growing and your conviction that pricing can remain favorable on the HDD side or through the back of this year and potentially into '25?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. I think the whole key to that question is to continue to innovate. It's just as simple as that. If we continue to innovate and build a better product and deliver a better TCO to our customers, we're able to continue to participate in the value of that R&D that we're spending. We just announced a new drive that's 32 terabytes which is 13% more capacity than next biggest drive on the market which is our 28-terabyte drive. So as long as we continue to do that, we go to our customers and they get a better value proposition and we're able to participate in that. And as long as we continue to drive the road map forward and I have a tremendous amount of conviction that's the case, we're going to do that. We will continue to drive margins higher in this business.\nAmit Daryanani: Maybe just help me clarify this. Is the performance on the HDD side, more a reflection of your peer has not had HAMR come out yet. And once that comes out, perhaps market share and gross margins normalize, I guess, the feel would be, is this all durable? Or does it go away from a margin perspective once Seagate has HAMR in volume production with the hyperscalers.\nDavid Goeckeler: No. Like I said, I don't think it has -- it has to do of continuing to deliver greater TCO. The underlying technology that you're delivering on the product I don't think matters that much, right? It's like customers want more density in the same slot and we're able to deliver that. We have a road map to deliver that. Other people in the industry have a road map to deliver that and we're going to continue to drive TCO down. We get better visibility into ordering. I've talked a lot about, I think, hard drives have been an industry that's been persistently oversupplied given the client to cloud transition. We're past all of that now. And I think we're seeing what the dynamics of the industry are like when we get the supply-demand balance right. We get our manufacturing footprint the way we want it. We deliver world-class leading products that provide enormous amounts of value to our customers. And we're -- that drives margin higher because it's a great value proposition for our customers. It's a good deal for them. It's a good deal for us. And I think that is incredibly durable.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.\nVijay Rakesh: Just -- I mean, obviously, very solid execution on the gross margin side, I think, is the highest in 5 years. But as you look at the road map forward, can you level set where you think hard disk drive and NAND margins could get to? Because I think in the past, obviously, NAND margins have gone like 45%, 50%. And I think we see hard disk drive margins at 38%, 39%. Could you help us like how to walk to the margin ARPU going out?\nDavid Goeckeler: I think in the -- look, so next quarter, margins in both business are going up which is what we want. And I think as long as we continue -- in the NAND business, we -- again, we have to continue to innovate and bring great products to market and I think our portfolio is as strong as it's ever been. And we've always -- we've been strong for a long time in consumer. I mean that's been a stalwart of the business for a very, very long time. We have a very strong client portfolio. We have a very strong gaming portfolio. We've always been good in mobile and now we have enterprise SSD, where we're building out the portfolio right at the time where the AI Data Cycle is really driving a significant amount of demand. So I think from a technology perspective and where the portfolio is positioned, we're in very, very good shape. At that point, we look at long-term supply-demand balance of the business. We all know it's a cyclical business. You have to add CapEx in very large increments to bring on capacity, nodal transitions give you more capacity. We talked about this in our new era of NAND. I think this idea that the layer race and let's just put bigger and bigger nodes on the market and count on elasticity to soak up all the bits. Like I think that era of NAND is in the past, the era of NAND in the future is more strategic introduction of new nodes that add capacity, more innovation within the node on performance, power, capacity and so that, I think, is something that says the way we're going to manage our business is different than it has been in the past. And then, we look at just the overall supply-demand balance. And there's been not a lot of CapEx spending in NAND coming out of the downturn. And so we see a good supply-demand balance. So we expect to see continued positive momentum in the portfolio. On HDD, this is a business that is, like I said in the prepared remarks, we think it's gone through a remarkable transformation over the last year, really. We're starting to see the -- we're starting to see the results of this transformation that's been going on, quite frankly, for a long time. One is about getting through this client to cloud transition. Industry has been in that position for 15 years probably. So we're kind of through that now. Client is just a much, much smaller percent of the portfolio. Even if you look back to the past peak of our business, client was a much bigger percent just 3, 4, 5 years ago than it is today. So it's a cloud business now. We continue to deliver really strong TCO gains with our technology road map. And I think the business has a long road map on continuing to be able to drive better TCO for our customers. And then on the demand side, you've got -- again, you've got AI now the AI Data Cycle where HDD is going to be a big part of that on the input side, all of this data is stored on HDDs. And on the output side, people producing a lot more content to be stored on HDD. So we see a good demand environment, good business practices of getting the right visibility into how we should add capacity, so we don't end up in an oversupplied market. So I think the HDD business has structurally changed. I see the margins going higher and going higher in a structural way that will be maintained at a higher point. It's not a value proposition question. The value is really there. And like I said, we continue to drive TCO lower. We're going to continue to drive margins higher.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: I was wondering maybe you could square your comments a little bit on proactively mixing bits across end markets in a quarter where your bit shipment declined below what you had originally expected. But at the same time, you also had inventory build in the quarter. And as a clarification from a prior question, could you just help us think through in the September quarter, what is the like-for-like ASP trajectory for NAND as well.\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. So first of all, the mix, I think, the first one was the mix question. So was the question in the quarter?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, in the fourth quarter, it's how do we proactively -- how we proactively mix the bits to generate better profitability.\nDavid Goeckeler: When bits were declining. Okay. So yes. I mean, look, I mean, I guess, in a big picture, we're always just looking at every market that we're in and what demand is on a week-over-week basis and what our customers are telling us and we're trying to put the bits to where we're going to get the highest return. We saw some headwinds in consumer. So we mixed into other parts of client business. And we also saw really good growth in enterprise SSD. I think we saw 60% sequential growth in enterprise SSD. So that provided a floor on kind of how we think about the mix side of it. And the second part of the question?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, the -- so on the -- maybe on the comments on the inventory, Wamsi, it's not unusual for exiting the June quarter for us to have inventory builds as we get prepared for the second half that tends to be more consumer oriented and sort of there's more shipments that typically take place. And so we're comfortable with that. Yes. So on the like-for-like for the September quarter, we're expecting the ASPs in NAND to be slightly up in the sort of low single-digit percentage range.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from -- excuse me, Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had one quick clarification and one question. On the clarification, the dis-synergies, we saw the $35 million to $45 million you guided to for the December quarter, is it fair to assume that's kind of a steady state for the combined business going forward post separation? Or do those costs go away? Or do those costs potentially go up beyond separation. That's my clarification question. And then my question for Dave on the NAND side, -- are your fabs fully loaded at this point? I know at the trough of the cycle, you had cut pretty significantly along with your peers. But where are utilization rates today? And how should we think about fiscal '25 CapEx?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. Let me -- thanks, Toshiya. Let me take the first part of the question. So with respect to the synergies costs that I discussed for the December quarter, they range in and you noted $35 million to $45 million. This is -- it's fair to assume that this is where steady state will be until the separation and going forward.\nDavid Goeckeler: And then on the NAND -- the fabs are -- we're running at full utilization. We don't have underutilization costs on NAND at this point. And then the third part of the question.\nWissam Jabre: On the CapEx.\nDavid Goeckeler: FY '25 CapEx.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. So on the CapEx side, look, we're -- what I'm -- what I think, we will share is where we see CapEx in this current quarter. And the -- from a cash CapEx perspective, for this quarter, I expect it to be more or less in line with the fiscal fourth quarter which was around 2% of revenue. And our thoughts on CapEx with respect to basically future investments haven't changed, we'd like to continue to focus on the profitability of the business. And at this point in time, that's really our main focus.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Fox at Fox Research.\nSteven Fox: I was just wondering how -- given experience in prior cycles on the HDD side and you mentioned the 52-week lead times, how do you sort of protect yourself against customers being overzealous with orders and then maybe disappointing you down the road? What are you doing to make sure customers live up to their promises.\nDavid Goeckeler: I mean, these are very big relationships with very big customers. So we're very close to them on a day-to-day basis. So that is clearly something we look for. But I think there's a lot of relationship value here as well. So we'll be on the lookout for that. But we expect our customers to be fairly rational about this whole process. I mean, look, we're in an area of HDD where almost everybody that we talk to would like to have more HDDs right now. So I think everybody is understanding that giving us more visibility will allow us to set our manufacturing infrastructure in a way where we can satisfy the market without ending up in the situation we are in, in the down cycle where we were having to really, really cut costs and quite frankly, move a lot of people off the payroll which is an unpleasant exercise. So we'll stay very close to our customers. And we have also have a lot of information on kind of ordering patterns and all that kind of stuff. So we'll keep an eye out for that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.\nAsiya Merchant: Great If I may, just if you can talk a little bit about the industry structure that has changed and maybe how it reflects in your cost declines across both your Flash and HDD business. how we should think about that going forward, given that you see a favorable pricing environment and if you can balance that with maybe improved cost decline for both NAND and HDD.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So on the HDD side, there's been a couple of things that are -- have been contributing to better margins getting here. One is just we reset the manufacturing base and we've been coming off a very low number. So as we produce more and we get to full utilization, we get better cost per unit out of that. So that's been a good tailwind. But we're -- as I talked about, we're at the point where we know where all the drives over the next couple of quarters are going. And then the other part of it is as you said, technology-driven cost improvements, continuing to innovate, deliver better TCO, better cost dynamics. And we continue to drive down the cost per terabyte on the HDD business. It's going down like high single digits a year or something like that. On NAND, of course, we continue to drive cost down in the 15% range for this year, we're still good with that number. So that's a big part of the storage industry, has continued to drive the cost down through technology innovation and we feel very good about where we are in the R&D teams we have that can continue to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Goeckeler for closing remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. You appreciate your time today. We look forward to talking to everybody throughout the quarter. We're very happy with where the business is and where we're driving, we think the portfolio is in a great shape and things are going in the right direction. We look forward to talking to you about it more as we move throughout the quarter. Thanks for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 performance. Western Digital delivered strong results with fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $3.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 36.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44. For the fiscal year 2024, revenue totaled $13 billion. We have maintained our strategic focus on aligning our portfolio of industry-leading products with growth opportunities across a broad range of end markets to mitigate volatility while structurally improving our through-cycle profitability for both Flash and HDD. Before we discuss our performance, I want to provide our views on where the storage market is heading and how we are well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Our diverse portfolio, coupled with the structural changes we have made to strengthen our operations, is enabling us to benefit from the broad recovery we are beginning to see across our end markets. In addition, the AI Data Cycle is increasing the need for storage and creating new demand drivers across both Flash and HDD. These AI systems process and analyze existing data, generate new data and require substantial storage for training, operating in a continuous cycle of increasing data consumption, processing and generation. As AI technologies advance, data storage systems must deliver the capacity and performance necessary to support the computational demands of large sophisticated models while managing vast volumes of data. Given this landscape, we expect Flash to benefit from both AI training and inference while HDD is poised to benefit at both the input and output stages of these AI models. To address the growing performance, power and capacity requirements, we have developed our Flash and HDD product road maps to meet our end customer storage needs across the entire AI Data Cycle. We introduced the industry-leading high-performance PCIe Gen 5 SSD to support AI training and inference. A high-capacity 64 terabyte SSD for optimizing the build-out of rapid AI data lakes in the world's highest capacity ePMR UltraSMR 32-terabyte hard drive for cost effective and deep content storage at scale. These new offerings demonstrate our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. As we enter fiscal year 2025, we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities in data storage and believe the AI Data Cycle will be a significant incremental growth driver for the storage industry. Before I dive further into business updates, I want to update you on our separation plans. I am pleased with the progress our team has made as we continue to drive to completing the work required to separate the company at the end of the calendar year. As part of the ongoing preparation for the separation, we anticipate beginning to incur separation dis-synergy costs in the second half of the calendar year. Wissam will briefly discuss the anticipated impact of these costs. I'll now turn to business updates. Starting with Flash, the growth in revenue was driven by the recovery in cloud and a shift of our client mix to gaming and mobile, partially offset by a decline in consumer. Our focus on driving higher through-cycle profitability is reflected in our results as we proactively mix bits across our end markets. Our innovative offerings remain at the forefront of the market, reinforcing our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. For example, our new QLC-based client SSDs which grew 50% on a sequential exabyte basis, offer significantly better performance than our previous generation TLC products. Combining this high-performance node with our in-house controller development, enable us to provide a portfolio of client SSDs that deliver unmatched performance and value. We believe these products will lead the industry's transition to QLC flash. During our New Era of NAND webinar last month, we introduced the world's highest capacity BiCS8 2-terabyte QLC memory die, specifically designed to meet growing data center and AI storage needs. Built on a chip bonded to array architecture, BiCS8 reinforces Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost and capital efficiency as well as superior I/O performance by integrating wafer bonding in advanced 3D manufacturing to establish a ground-breaking foundation for future scalability of 3D NAND. In addition, our 64 terabyte enterprise SSD is now being sampled with plans for volume shipment later this calendar year. Furthermore, our PCIe Gen 5 based enterprise SSD delivers best-in-class read performance as well as power efficiency. We are seeing significant interest in this product which is currently qualifying at a hyperscaler with ramp expected in the second half of this calendar year. We'll talk more about our Flash road map at the upcoming Flash Memory Summit in early August. Turning to the Flash outlook. Throughout the fourth quarter, our product mix was dynamic as we proactively mix bits between our end markets in response to the softness we are seeing in the more transactional markets such as consumer and channel. Our success in identifying the most profitable approach to allocating bits is reflected in the growth of both our revenue and gross margin. As we look into the first quarter, in addition to the mix environment we saw in the fourth quarter, we expect the continued ramp of our new enterprise SSD offerings and seasonal strength in mobile to drive mid- to high-teens bit growth on a sequential basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect enterprise SSDs to represent a double-digit percent share in our portfolio mix. The new era of NAND is driving a period of change and we are going to remain disciplined in managing our capital spending. The layers focus race is behind us. The emphasis is now shifting towards strategically timing the economic introduction of new longer-lasting nodes. Innovation now means enhancing power efficiency, performance and capacity within these nodes, while capital decisions increasingly prioritize opportunities for margin expansion and revenue growth. Turning to HDD; revenue growth was driven by strength in nearline demand and improved pricing. By leveraging our SMR leadership and lean cost structure, we have surpassed our target gross margin range, underscoring our ongoing commitment to improve future profitability. The HDD business has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent quarters, marked by strategic initiatives aimed at introducing the most innovative, high-capacity products to market. We have increased our profitability meaningfully by restructuring our manufacturing footprint and optimizing our cost structure to drive operational efficiency. All while qualifying and ramping our SMR technology. We continue to structurally change the way we are operating our HDD business. With better visibility into future demand, operational excellence and a commitment to sustaining supply-demand balance, we are poised to continue our trajectory of bringing highly innovative products to market while increasing profitability into the future. On the technology front, we ship samples of our 32-terabyte UltraSMR/ePMR nearline hard drives to select customers. These drives feature advanced triple-stage actuators and OptiNAND technology which are designed for seamless qualification, integration and deployment in hyperscale cloud and enterprise data centers while maintaining exceptional reliability. With this in mind, we are well positioned to deliver the industry's highest capacity hard drives and the best TCO. Turning to the HDD outlook. As we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect further growth driven by greater demand and more favorable pricing. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR and we anticipate a third major cloud vendor to begin the ramp of adopting SMR in the fiscal first quarter. Our leading products and lean cost structure have supported ongoing profitability improvements in our HDD business. We remain focused on driving higher margins to reflect the significant innovation and TCO improvements we deliver to our customers. Our strategic approach to commercializing ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies has proven to be the winning strategy, enabling us to surpass our gross margin target for HDDs in the midst of AI's emergence as another pivotal growth driver for the industry. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results. Thanks, Wissam. Today's results and guidance underscore Western Digital's strong execution with promising growth opportunities ahead. We delivered solid results as we doubled down on our strategic initiatives and product road map, capitalizing on robust growth prospects for both Flash and HDD. The emergence of the AI Data Cycle marks an incredibly exciting transformation in our industry, driving fundamental shifts across our end markets. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25 we are well positioned to leverage our leadership positions to spearhead innovative technologies and deliver unparalleled value for our customers. Peter, let's begin the Q&A. Yes. Sure. Thanks, C.J. So yes, we were very happy with where the HDD business is at. We've -- we spent a long time focused on getting our manufacturing footprint in the right spot and a lot of cost optimization there now that the volume ramps back, it puts us in a strong position plus the products, right? The continued strong adoption of UltraSMR, those drives are great for us. They're great for our customers. They're leading capacity points. So when you put it all together, we were able to deliver past our gross margin target in that business. Some of the historians around here tell me it's like the best gross margin ever. And the good news, as you said, is it's going higher. So we got good supply-demand balance that's giving us good visibility throughout the rest of the calendar year, we're -- we pretty much know where every drive is going to go. At this point, we made, I think, a really significant transition this past quarter and that we moved up our request to our customers to give us visibility 52 weeks ahead, so a 52-week lead time on HDDs. Now the reason that's so important is the cycle time underneath to build an HDD is about 50 weeks. So we've been working very hard to drive the technology, drive our manufacturing but also change the business practices of this business to give us the visibility that allows us to really align our investment with our customer demand. Our customers have responded well to that request and we now have visibility for the entire fiscal year from a number of our biggest customers. Others are still -- we're still working through it with them. But to wrap it all up, we're -- we're very happy with where the margins are. We continue to see margins going higher in this business as we continue to innovate. If we continue to innovate, deliver better TCO to our customers, we're going to continue to drive margins higher and we've got a very robust road map to do that. And we're now getting the visibility in place to -- in the business practices to make sure we can keep supply and demand balance going far into the future. So hopefully, that addresses your question. As you know, Joe, it's a very dynamic market. So we're still seeing -- in the negotiated markets, we're still seeing good pricing increases, especially enterprise SSD and that's something we're very excited about. We see -- we saw really good sequential growth in enterprise SSD and we're expecting very good sequential growth in the next quarter. Some of the more transactional markets where you have more players involved and frankly, some players that don't produce their own raw NAND, pricing is a little more dynamic and demand in general in consumer is a little bit weak. So in those markets, we see a little more demand headwind, a little more -- not quite as aggressive as pricing moves but in the negotiated markets, we still see good pricing. And then, you put mix all on top of that to come up with a quarter-by-quarter number where you got quite a bit of variability. But as we go through the back half of the year, we continue to see strong demand in Enterprise SSD. We see the PC market really kind of maybe a little bit of an inventory rebalancing here going on in the next quarter but we see that improving as we go throughout the year. I think that's a normal process given a couple of really strong quarters here in the first part of the recovery of NAND pricing. So we still see demand outstripping supply through the second half of the year. And quite frankly, our modeling shows throughout next calendar year as well. I'll take the second part of the question. Kind of remember the first part now. Yes. And Aaron, on the NAND pricing, I think you kind of answered your question as you went through there, just to confirm it. There's a huge mix dynamic. So we've got -- like everybody else, we're seeing some weakness in the consumer. And so that's -- consumer is 1/3 of our Flash portfolio. So that's a big business and that has very we've always talked about higher than average through-cycle margins. So that's a bit of a headwind. And then we -- it's a seasonally strong quarter for mobile. So that's -- there's a big mix dynamic there as well. So that -- but you're thinking about it the right way. Yes. They are 2 separate products targeted to different parts of the AI Data Cycle. So the compute product that you mentioned, what we call a compute product because it's designed to feed data into GPUs and keep the pipeline full. So very high performance, very high-performance NAND. That product is a qualification in a hyperscaler and we're getting a lot of interest in that product across the AI ecosystem of anybody that's building an AI training infrastructure because we believe that product is the best read performance and really good power efficiency and that's what everybody is looking for in that market. The 64 terabyte drive is a separate product that's targeted at building these high-performance data lakes for AI training and we're looking at that across the kind of same sort of customers. Anybody that's building an AI training infrastructure is looking for those kind of products. And that's in addition to the products we had qualified enterprise SSD, we had qualified 2 or 3 of the hyperscalers before the downturn and those products are picking back up now as well. So we have a much -- we were -- we were happy with the portfolio and now we keep adding to it. And those products are really well targeted to where the demand is in enterprise SSD which is a lot of pull on people building AI training infrastructure. We know -- we think that the share in our products is because they are great products, right? We're delivering the highest TCO products. We've had this road map for a long time. None of our customers are surprised by our road map. They know about our road map, quite frankly, years in advance and we work with them very closely. So we believe we're providing the highest capacity -- well, we are providing the highest capacity drives at scale. They're easily qualified. The architecture is well known to our customers. and they deliver absolutely the best TCO. And if you're building a data center architecture at the scale our customers do, TCO is incredibly important. And now we've delivered a 32-terabyte drive. First time anybody has crossed the 30 terabyte at scale, that's sampling really great TCO. And then the UltraSMR side of it, these drives can deliver 20% more capacity with UltraSMR versus a typical SMR drive which is 10% more capacity that's great for our customers. They get more capacity per unit. It's great for us because we get 20% more capacity or the incremental 10% without adding any COGS to the system, so that's margin accretive. That's very nice. And we're seeing now the third hyperscaler starting to adopt our UltraSMR technology starting in the second half of the year. So we just feel really good where the portfolio is. We think this portfolio has been in development for decades to get to this point. These were decisions that were made a long time ago given the lead times in this business. And so we believe we're -- customers are just responding to great products. And the TCO increases in the supply-demand balance allow us to also work on the pricing side of it as well. So as far as capacity, look, I mentioned it earlier, we got to this 52-week lead time that was really important because now we're starting to get forecast from our customers a year out. It gives us the ability to plan for capacity. So as we get -- as those forecasts come in and we roll them up and we work with our customers and we look at that, what that picture looks like, then we'll be in a position to address this issue of do we add capacity. But we don't want -- we're not going to add capacity for a 2-quarter increase in volume. We think this is much more sustained than that. As I talked about, AI is going to be a big driver -- the AI Data Cycle will be a big driver for HDDs as well. We see sustained demand into the future. But we want to see the commitments from our customers and them to give us that visibility and we now have that in place. And as we get the whole market, all of our customers looking at that over the next quarter or so, we'll have a better I think a better way to answer that question of do we plan to add capacity. But for right now, we're happy with where our capacity is. and what we're able to ship and mix keeps going up and we're able to ship more exabytes per quarter based on mix. Yes. I think the whole key to that question is to continue to innovate. It's just as simple as that. If we continue to innovate and build a better product and deliver a better TCO to our customers, we're able to continue to participate in the value of that R&D that we're spending. We just announced a new drive that's 32 terabytes which is 13% more capacity than next biggest drive on the market which is our 28-terabyte drive. So as long as we continue to do that, we go to our customers and they get a better value proposition and we're able to participate in that. And as long as we continue to drive the road map forward and I have a tremendous amount of conviction that's the case, we're going to do that. We will continue to drive margins higher in this business. No. Like I said, I don't think it has -- it has to do of continuing to deliver greater TCO. The underlying technology that you're delivering on the product I don't think matters that much, right? It's like customers want more density in the same slot and we're able to deliver that. We have a road map to deliver that. Other people in the industry have a road map to deliver that and we're going to continue to drive TCO down. We get better visibility into ordering. I've talked a lot about, I think, hard drives have been an industry that's been persistently oversupplied given the client to cloud transition. We're past all of that now. And I think we're seeing what the dynamics of the industry are like when we get the supply-demand balance right. We get our manufacturing footprint the way we want it. We deliver world-class leading products that provide enormous amounts of value to our customers. And we're -- that drives margin higher because it's a great value proposition for our customers. It's a good deal for them. It's a good deal for us. And I think that is incredibly durable. I think in the -- look, so next quarter, margins in both business are going up which is what we want. And I think as long as we continue -- in the NAND business, we -- again, we have to continue to innovate and bring great products to market and I think our portfolio is as strong as it's ever been. And we've always -- we've been strong for a long time in consumer. I mean that's been a stalwart of the business for a very, very long time. We have a very strong client portfolio. We have a very strong gaming portfolio. We've always been good in mobile and now we have enterprise SSD, where we're building out the portfolio right at the time where the AI Data Cycle is really driving a significant amount of demand. So I think from a technology perspective and where the portfolio is positioned, we're in very, very good shape. At that point, we look at long-term supply-demand balance of the business. We all know it's a cyclical business. You have to add CapEx in very large increments to bring on capacity, nodal transitions give you more capacity. We talked about this in our new era of NAND. I think this idea that the layer race and let's just put bigger and bigger nodes on the market and count on elasticity to soak up all the bits. Like I think that era of NAND is in the past, the era of NAND in the future is more strategic introduction of new nodes that add capacity, more innovation within the node on performance, power, capacity and so that, I think, is something that says the way we're going to manage our business is different than it has been in the past. And then, we look at just the overall supply-demand balance. And there's been not a lot of CapEx spending in NAND coming out of the downturn. And so we see a good supply-demand balance. So we expect to see continued positive momentum in the portfolio. On HDD, this is a business that is, like I said in the prepared remarks, we think it's gone through a remarkable transformation over the last year, really. We're starting to see the -- we're starting to see the results of this transformation that's been going on, quite frankly, for a long time. One is about getting through this client to cloud transition. Industry has been in that position for 15 years probably. So we're kind of through that now. Client is just a much, much smaller percent of the portfolio. Even if you look back to the past peak of our business, client was a much bigger percent just 3, 4, 5 years ago than it is today. So it's a cloud business now. We continue to deliver really strong TCO gains with our technology road map. And I think the business has a long road map on continuing to be able to drive better TCO for our customers. And then on the demand side, you've got -- again, you've got AI now the AI Data Cycle where HDD is going to be a big part of that on the input side, all of this data is stored on HDDs. And on the output side, people producing a lot more content to be stored on HDD. So we see a good demand environment, good business practices of getting the right visibility into how we should add capacity, so we don't end up in an oversupplied market. So I think the HDD business has structurally changed. I see the margins going higher and going higher in a structural way that will be maintained at a higher point. It's not a value proposition question. The value is really there. And like I said, we continue to drive TCO lower. We're going to continue to drive margins higher. Okay. So first of all, the mix, I think, the first one was the mix question. So was the question in the quarter? When bits were declining. Okay. So yes. I mean, look, I mean, I guess, in a big picture, we're always just looking at every market that we're in and what demand is on a week-over-week basis and what our customers are telling us and we're trying to put the bits to where we're going to get the highest return. We saw some headwinds in consumer. So we mixed into other parts of client business. And we also saw really good growth in enterprise SSD. I think we saw 60% sequential growth in enterprise SSD. So that provided a floor on kind of how we think about the mix side of it. And the second part of the question? And then on the NAND -- the fabs are -- we're running at full utilization. We don't have underutilization costs on NAND at this point. And then the third part of the question. FY '25 CapEx. I mean, these are very big relationships with very big customers. So we're very close to them on a day-to-day basis. So that is clearly something we look for. But I think there's a lot of relationship value here as well. So we'll be on the lookout for that. But we expect our customers to be fairly rational about this whole process. I mean, look, we're in an area of HDD where almost everybody that we talk to would like to have more HDDs right now. So I think everybody is understanding that giving us more visibility will allow us to set our manufacturing infrastructure in a way where we can satisfy the market without ending up in the situation we are in, in the down cycle where we were having to really, really cut costs and quite frankly, move a lot of people off the payroll which is an unpleasant exercise. So we'll stay very close to our customers. And we have also have a lot of information on kind of ordering patterns and all that kind of stuff. So we'll keep an eye out for that. Yes. So on the HDD side, there's been a couple of things that are -- have been contributing to better margins getting here. One is just we reset the manufacturing base and we've been coming off a very low number. So as we produce more and we get to full utilization, we get better cost per unit out of that. So that's been a good tailwind. But we're -- as I talked about, we're at the point where we know where all the drives over the next couple of quarters are going. And then the other part of it is as you said, technology-driven cost improvements, continuing to innovate, deliver better TCO, better cost dynamics. And we continue to drive down the cost per terabyte on the HDD business. It's going down like high single digits a year or something like that. On NAND, of course, we continue to drive cost down in the 15% range for this year, we're still good with that number. So that's a big part of the storage industry, has continued to drive the cost down through technology innovation and we feel very good about where we are in the R&D teams we have that can continue to do that. All right. Thanks, everyone. You appreciate your time today. We look forward to talking to everybody throughout the quarter. We're very happy with where the business is and where we're driving, we think the portfolio is in a great shape and things are going in the right direction. We look forward to talking to you about it more as we move throughout the quarter. Thanks for your time today."

            "content": "Thanks, David. And good afternoon, everyone. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Western Digital delivered great results with gross margin and earnings per share exceeding the high end of the guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 9% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.44. Looking at end markets, Cloud represented 50% of total revenue at $1.9 billion. The sequential growth of 21% is attributed to higher nearline shipments and pricing in HDD, coupled with increased bit shipments and pricing in enterprise SSD. The 89% year-over-year increase was due to higher shipments and price per unit in nearline HDDs along with higher enterprise SSD bit shipments. Nearline bit shipments were at a record level of 125 exabytes, up 16% from the previous quarter and 113% compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Client represented 32% of total revenue at $1.2 billion. The sequential increase of 3% was due to the increase in flash ASPs, offsetting a decline in flash bit shipments while HDD revenue decreased slightly. The 16% year-over-year growth was driven by higher flash ASPs. Consumer represented 18% of total revenue at $0.7 billion. Sequentially, the 7% decrease was due to lower flash and HDD bit shipments, partially offset by higher ASPs in both flash and HDD. The 5% year-over-year increase was driven by improved flash ASPs and bit shipments. For fiscal year 2024, revenue was $13 billion, up 6% from fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 22.8% and non-GAAP operating margin increased 8.7 percentage points to 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.20. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2024, Cloud revenue increased 2% year-over-year due to higher demand for capacity enterprise HDDs and improved pricing. For the year, client and consumer revenue grew by 7% and 9%, respectively, due to higher flash bit shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Compared to last year -- last quarter, Flash ASPs were up 14% on a blended basis and 11% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 7% sequentially and 3% compared to last year as we proactively mixed Flash bits to maximize profitability. HDD revenue was $2 billion, up 14% from last quarter as exabyte shipments increased 12% and average price per unit increased 12% to $163. Compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 55%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 72% and 64%, respectively. Moving to the rest of the income statement. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Our focus on improving through-cycle profitability in both Flash and HDD has shown great progress. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin reached 36.3% well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved by 7 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing and cost reduction as well as higher volume. Within Flash, by proactively allocating bits between end markets and executing on our cost reduction initiatives, we have improved gross margin for 4 consecutive quarters. Flash gross margin was 36.5%, up 9.1 percentage points compared to last quarter and 48.4 percentage points year-over-year. In HDD, by offering a leading product portfolio and running efficient manufacturing operations focused on cost discipline, we continue to make progress in improving profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 36.1%, exceeding the long-term target range, up 5 percentage points sequentially and 15.4 percentage points compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Operating expenses were $700 million for the quarter, above our guided range, primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected profitability. Operating income was $666 million, tax expense was $17 million, earnings per share was $1.44. Operating cash flow was $366 million and free cash flow was $282 million. Cash capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. For fiscal year 2024, cash capital expenditures were $244 million or 1.9% of revenue, excluding the proceeds from the sale leaseback of our Milpitas facility. Year-over-year, this represented a 69% decline. Fourth quarter inventory was up from the prior quarter at $3.3 billion. With days of inventory increasing from 119 days to 126 days. A decline in HDD inventory was more than offset by an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.5 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion and total liquidity was $4.1 billion including undrawn revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. I'll now turn to the fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance. We anticipate both Flash and HDD revenue and gross margin to improve on a sequential basis as we continue to drive improvements in profitability across our businesses. We anticipate revenue to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $695 million to $715 million. A decrease in variable compensation will be offset by the synergy costs as we continue to make progress executing on the separation plans. Included in this range are dis-synergy costs of $15 million to $25 million. We expect the synergy costs in the fiscal second quarter to be between $35 million and $45 million. Interest and expenses are anticipated to be approximately $110 million. Tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 17%. We expect earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.85 based on approximately 360 million shares outstanding. As shown in our guidance, we remain committed to driving higher profitability while maintaining focus on cost and capital discipline. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Yes, sure. As I noted in the prepared remarks, in Q4, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. And so as we generate cash, our focus is to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. The -- with respect to the second part of the question related to question related to the capital structure. Obviously, we're making good progress as we prepare for the separation, we will be as -- we get closer to the time of the separation, will be hosting Capital Market Days or Investor Days to discuss that in more detail. But as we've always said, our aim is to create 2 world-class companies that are competitive in their own spaces. And so their cap structures would be reflecting their -- the profile from a profitability, cash generation and market dynamics as well. Let me take the first part related to the dis-synergy costs. The question was whether they were split -- they were all in operating expenses or there's anything in COGS. So Aaron, the numbers that I quoted, the $15 million to $25 million are all in operating expenses. There will be some dis-synergy costs in the COGS but they're really not material. And so that's why we didn't call them out. And they're reflected also in our guidance for Q1. Yes, in the fourth quarter, it's how do we proactively -- how we proactively mix the bits to generate better profitability. Yes, the -- so on the -- maybe on the comments on the inventory, Wamsi, it's not unusual for exiting the June quarter for us to have inventory builds as we get prepared for the second half that tends to be more consumer oriented and sort of there's more shipments that typically take place. And so we're comfortable with that. Yes. So on the like-for-like for the September quarter, we're expecting the ASPs in NAND to be slightly up in the sort of low single-digit percentage range. Yes. Let me -- thanks, Toshiya. Let me take the first part of the question. So with respect to the synergies costs that I discussed for the December quarter, they range in and you noted $35 million to $45 million. This is -- it's fair to assume that this is where steady state will be until the separation and going forward. On the CapEx. Yes. So on the CapEx side, look, we're -- what I'm -- what I think, we will share is where we see CapEx in this current quarter. And the -- from a cash CapEx perspective, for this quarter, I expect it to be more or less in line with the fiscal fourth quarter which was around 2% of revenue. And our thoughts on CapEx with respect to basically future investments haven't changed, we'd like to continue to focus on the profitability of the business. And at this point in time, that's really our main focus."

Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plan and performance, the separation of our flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call to discuss our third quarter of fiscal year 2024 performance. Western Digital delivered excellent results in the quarter with revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, all of which exceeded expectations. Our strategy of developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets, coupled with structural changes we have made to both of our businesses, is unlocking our true earnings potential and allowing us to continue improving through-cycle profitability and dampening business cycles. This strategy enables us to generate higher earnings per share even in a constrained supply environment. In addition, our commitment to achieving operational efficiency and enhancing our agility has allowed us to run our flash and HDD businesses more efficiently and further drive innovation to take advantage of new opportunities. In particular, as the technology landscape continues to evolve, the demand for AI solutions is becoming increasingly apparent across our end markets. The uptick in AI adoption is highlighting the incredible value of data and will drive increased storage demand across both HDD and flash at the edge and in the core, providing greater long-term growth and margin expansion opportunities for Western Digital. We are in the early innings of unlocking the full potential of this company, and our team remains focused on improving the profitability of our business to drive long-term margin expansion and shareholder value as these new demand opportunities present themselves. Before I dive further into the demand environment, I want to briefly comment on the status of the separation of our flash and HDD businesses. I am proud of the team's ongoing efforts as we drive towards completion of the separation in the second half of the calendar year. We remain focused on achieving the separation as soon as possible, and we'll continue to provide further updates on our progress as appropriate. Moving on to end market commentary. I am pleased to report that during the quarter, revenue in all of our major end markets returned to year-over-year growth. In cloud, we experienced 29% growth in revenue from a year ago, highlighting the incredible success of our industry-leading HDD product line. In addition, we began to experience an increase in demand for our flash-based solutions, signaling a long-awaited recovery in this end market. In client, 20% revenue growth from a year ago was driven by increased bit demand for our flash-based solutions, coupled with an increase in ASPs. In consumer, we experienced 17% revenue growth from a year ago, highlighting the power of the SanDisk premium brand. Higher flash bit sales, combined with a better pricing environment more than offset the continued decline in consumer HDD demand. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with flash. Our sequential revenue growth in the quarter reflects the continuing commitment to disciplined capital spending and carefully optimizing bit shipments into our most profitable end markets to take advantage of the improved pricing environment. This approach, combined with the strength of our product portfolio has enabled us to drive significantly higher profitability while strategically managing our inventory. On the technology front, we achieved a significant milestone by initiating mass production of our QLC-based client SSD, leveraging BiCS 6 technology. This is yet another significant milestone demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. These advancements pave the way to spearhead the market's transition to QLC-based flash solutions in calendar year 2024. Additionally, our progress with BiCS 8 is on track. While this technology is ready to be productized as market conditions warrant, our innovative offerings will remain at the forefront of the market, further strengthening our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. As noted earlier, in the third quarter, we began to experience an increase in demand for our enterprise SSD solutions. We are seeing demand returning for NVMe SSDs that we qualified before the downturn. We are also experiencing significant interest in providing these products in dramatically higher capacities for AI-related applications which we expect to ship in the second half of the year. In addition, we are also sampling our newest high-performance PCIe Gen 5, BiCS 6-based enterprise SSD. We are preparing for qualification at a hyperscaler and the product is generating significant interest in the enterprise market. We expect to ramp in the second half of the calendar year. Turning to HDD. The sequential revenue increase was driven by improved nearline demand and higher pricing as we focused on optimizing profitability per exabyte sold. In particular, nearline revenue reached a fixed quarter high, reflecting the successful strategy we put in place to bring the most innovative, high-capacity and high-performance drives to market. We have the right products at the right cost structure, which are reflected in our financial performance. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR with our 26-terabyte and 28-terabyte UltraSMR drives, quickly becoming a significant portion of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipments. SMR-based drives represented approximately 50% of nearline exabyte shipments in the quarter. Our portfolio strategy to commercialize ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies in advance of our transition to HAMR, has proven to be the winning strategy and enables us to deliver to customers the industry's highest capacity and leading TCO drives, all of which can be produced at scale with controlled costs. We are confident that our product strategy, which combines UltraSMR technology with upcoming advancements in nearline drives is enabling Western Digital to deliver best-in-class gross margin in HDDs all at a time when AI is emerging as another growth engine for the industry. As we move toward a new supply and demand environment, characterized by higher demand, supply tightness and product shortages, we are leveraging our proven technology we've already introduced to the market to meet the demands of our customers with the right portfolio at the right time, while also operating with a lean cost structure for continued profitability improvement in our HDD business. Although the actions we are taking have improved profitability, we remain focused on driving higher margins to appropriately value the incredible amount of innovation and TCO improvements we continue to deliver to our customers. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. Within Flash, in addition to growth opportunities at the edge, which is Western Digital strength, we are encouraged by the returning demand within the enterprise SSD market and expect growth throughout this calendar year. AI-related workloads are driving increasing demand for enterprise SSDs, and our portfolio is well positioned to support those use cases. Looking ahead, we anticipate bit shipments to remain flat into the fiscal fourth quarter and look to Flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver led by our focus on allocating bits to the most high-value end markets amidst the tightening supply environment. While we're pleased to see pricing trends moving in a positive direction, it's crucial to acknowledge the importance of maintaining capital discipline and only reinvesting capital back into the business once profitability improves further, and we see sustained demand. Overall, our continued focus on improving profitability through our innovation road map, disciplined capital spending and strategic pricing initiatives position us well for continued success in calendar year 2024 and into 2025 by offering the most capital and cost-efficient bits in the industry. In HDD, the success of our portfolio of leading capacity enterprise products, combined with the restructuring efforts we've implemented in recent years are yielding improved unit economics and greater visibility. As cloud demand is recovering, we anticipate continued growth driven by higher nearline demand and better pricing as we are now in a supply-constrained environment. We're optimistic about aligning the pricing of our products to better mirror the innovation we are integrating into them, supporting long-term margin expansion in our HDD business. As we reap the rewards of the innovation and operational efficiencies that we've implemented, we will look for opportunities to reinvest in the business when the conditions are ripe for expansion. We will approach every capital allocation decision with a focus on discipline. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial third quarter results.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, Western Digital return to profitability and free cash flow generation and delivered great results in the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, up 40% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 45% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, up 45% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The growth was primarily attributed to higher nearline shipments and improved nearline per unit pricing with Flash revenue up both sequentially and year-over-year. Nearline bit shipments of 108 exabytes were up 60% sequentially. Client represented 34% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase in Flash ASP more than offset a decline in Flash bit shipments, while HDD revenue decreased. Year-over-year, the increase was driven by growth in both Flash and HDD ASPs and Flash bit shipments. Consumer represented 21% of total revenue at $0.7 billion, down 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, both Flash and HDD were down at approximately similar rates and in line with seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by growth in flash bit shipments and ASP. Turning now to revenue by business segment for the fiscal third quarter. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, up 2% sequentially as ASP increased 18% on both blended and like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 15% from last quarter as we proactively focused our flash bit placement to maximize profitability. Flash revenue grew 30% from fiscal third quarter of 2023 on higher bits and ASP. HDD revenue was $1.8 billion, up 28% from last quarter, as exabyte shipments increased 41% and average price per unit increased 19% to $145. Compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 17%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 25% and 33%, respectively. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 29.3%, well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved 13.8 percentage points sequentially and 18.7 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing, our continued focus on cost reduction, and lower underutilization charges. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 27.4%, up 19.5 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 points year-over-year. There were no underutilization charges in the quarter. HDD gross margin was 31.1%, up 6.3 percentage points sequentially and 6.8 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $17 million or 1 percentage point headwind. HDD gross margin is within our long-term target range, including underutilization charges. This underscores the team's focus on cost reduction and profitability as previously, this level of gross margin was achieved with higher revenue. Operating expenses were $632 million for the quarter, up 13% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential increase was mainly driven by higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected financial results. Operating income was $380 million, which included HDD underutilization charges of 17 million. Tax expenses in the quarter was $51 million, reflecting the improved financial outlook for the fiscal year. Fiscal third quarter earnings per share was $0.63. Operating cash flow was $58 million, and free cash flow was 91 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash inflow of $33 million. Third quarter inventory was flat from the prior quarter at 3.2 billion, with days of inventory increasing 4 days to 119 days. A decline in HDD inventory offset an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.8 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, and total liquidity was $4.1 billion, including revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion and project sequential revenue growth in both HDD and Flash. In HDD, we expect continued momentum with our industry-leading SMR product portfolio aimed at the cloud. In flash, we anticipate bits will be flat and ASP is up as we continue optimizing our bit placement to maximize profitability. Gross margin is expected to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $670 million and $690 million with the increase mainly related to certain project-driven investments, coupled with higher variable compensation as the financial outlook has continued to strengthen. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal fourth quarter and $130 million to $140 million for fiscal year 2024 as the financial outlook improved. We expect earnings per share to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 342 million shares outstanding. The financial outlook has strengthened, and we will remain disciplined in executing the business, controlling our capital spending and improving our profitability. I will now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. I'm pleased with the team's performance in developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets. As industry supply and demand dynamics continue to improve, we will remain disciplined around our capital spending and focused on driving innovation and efficiency across our business. Coupled with the structural changes we have made to our businesses, we are confident in our ability to drive greater through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As we move forward, we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on the promising growth prospects that lie ahead, solidifying our leadership position in the industry, particularly as AI continues to drive new storage solution opportunities and growth. Okay. Peter, let's start the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the HDD side, the gross margins are spectacular and if we take out the underutilization you're north of 32%. So, curious from here as you think about on-going tightness, on-going growth in demand led by the cloud and a pricing strategy where I think you and your main competitor are being extraordinarily rational. How do you think the progression for that part of your business will look through the remainder of calendar '24 and into '25?\nDavid Goeckeler: Hi, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- the HDD business, we're really happy with where the portfolio is at. I think that's where it starts, bringing great products to market that deliver the highest capacity points and the best TCO for our customers and when we're able to do that, we can share in more of that TCO advantage we're bringing to market. I think that's been the strategy for quite some time, and we're really happy with where the portfolio is and it's really resonating with customers. But the other side of that is making sure we really control the cost side of it, so we're really focused on making sure we bring the lowest cost product as well and that leads to the margin expansion. And then we -- of course, we've got a returning demand environment as we get the cyclical recovery in HDD spending coming off of the lows that we all really understand. Going forward, we talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks. We expect to continue to bring great products to market. We expect to continue to drive better TCO for our customers and we're in an environment now where we have supply/demand balance and we've -- significant restructuring of our business during the downturn. We've taken capacity -- we've set our capacity of what we think the market needs as we emerge into this demand environment. We do see better supply/demand alignment. We see tightness in the market, that's leading to what you would expect as customers giving us more visibility into what their ordering looks like going forward. So we're optimistic about being able to continue to drive profitability of this business higher.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, on the NAND side, I think you guided last kind of high-teens bit growth and I'm just curious, is that still a number in play or given your prioritization of highest profitable areas of NAND, should we be thinking about a different number? And you're not talking about production, but actual revenue bits?\nDavid Goeckeler: You mean for our -- for what time period, just to make sure I understand your question?\nC.J. Muse: My apologies, for calendar '24.\nDavid Goeckeler: Calendar '24, look, we see -- yes, we still see demand in the mid to -- call it, the mid- to high teens for the market. We see supply like about 8% of bits in production. So we still see an undersupplied market. For us, we had bits down this quarter, we forecast them down double digits. We were right about that, maybe a little bit more flat going into next quarter as we kind of optimize our supply throughout the year where we can think we can get the best profitability.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you C.J.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you and congratulations on the results. In terms of the outlook, looking for 4 points of gross margin improvement, it seems like the like-for-like pricing, certainly in NAND is a lot better than that. HDD seems pretty good as well. What are the offsets that you only would see sort of 4 points of gross margin expansion given the improvement that we're seeing in absolute pricing?\nWissam Jabre: Hey Joe, thanks for the question. Look, our guide comprehends a balanced view of what we have in terms of information today with the outlook; yes, we see improvement in margins in both of the businesses. So on the flash side, we still anticipate improvement in pricing that will help gross margin move a bit higher from here. And on the HDD side, as David mentioned, we continue to focus on the obviously, the great technology that we deliver, but also the cost discipline and pricing of the products. So, all of these are comprehended in our guide.\nJoe Moore: Great and then as a follow-up, you sort of talked about these higher density SSDs in the second half of the calendar year for AI purposes. Can you talk about what has to happen to sort of get those drives out? Like is it you need new capacity points that you don't currently serve and then can you talk generally, it seems like AI is having some positive effects on both sides of your guys' business. Can you talk about that a little bit?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So what I would say about the AI demand as it's coming into focus. I don't think it's so much in the results just yet, but we're seeing where it's going to impact both businesses. And clearly, one of them you just outlined, which is we're seeing enterprise SSD demand return, we saw some increase in the last quarter. We expect some increase in this quarter. But really, as we look to the second half, we have customers coming to us wanting the kind of SSDs we built and qualified before the downturn. They just want them in much bigger capacity points, 30 and 60 terabyte capacity points. So it's the same product just taking it and increasing capacity and going through a qualification on that so we're in that process with customers. We also introduced a new SSD that's more compute focused, which is PCIe Gen 5 product based on BiCS 6, very high performance that plays a little bit different role in the AI training stack and we're getting very good feedback on that product. It's being qualified by our starting qualification, we samples. We're kind of getting rid of the qualification of the hyperscaler and we're seeing good demand in the enterprise market as well. So we feel like the portfolio set up well as we go into the second half, and we're seeing a lot of demand show up for people that are very building large amount of infrastructure for model training.\nJoe Moore: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well. The first question, I just want to go back to kind of like the gross margin dynamics with regard to the hardware business. David, if you look back a couple of years, right, you peaked at like 150, 155 exabytes of capacity shifts. As we hear about the industry being constrained, where do you -- where would you characterize your capacity footprint today? And is it fair to assume that you have to see gross margin at or even above the high end of the 31% to 34% target model that you've laid out to kind of come back in and add capacity?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. That's how we're thinking about it. This is a -- I've talked about this quite a bit and this is an industry that I think has been oversupplied with this client-to-cloud transition, it's been going on for 15 years. I think the downturn was in time when we saw a significant change in demand to say the least that we just decided to remove capacity to get supply and demand better balance. So as we -- we're just emerging into that market, Aaron. I mean I think as we start to see this market play out and dynamics get to the kind of business model and get more visibility into what the future is. We can have confidence in making investments if that's what we need to do to expand capacity I think as all of that comes into focus, and it's starting to happen. We're starting to see that. We're getting more visibility. We're getting to participate more in the TCO advantages that we're bringing to the market. We're seeing better dynamics and as that continues -- and we get more confidence, we're not there yet, then we would think about how do we bring more capacity into the market? But we're just at the -- we're kind of getting to the starting line is, I guess, what I would say.\nAaron Rakers: Yes that's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, just on the enterprise SSD topic. I think prior to the downturn you had talked about, I want to say it was 2 or 3 cloud OEMs that you had designed in with the NVMe drive, can you just talk about the breadth of what you're expecting? It just sounds like you're kind of getting back into the market, optimizing displacement there. So how do we think about the breadth of the customer base in that enterprise SSD space?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, you got -- I mean it's the -- what we're seeing now is when the market is coming back we're seeing those customers now come back up to a very long digestion period. And this is something we've been waiting for quite some time. Like every market from consumer to PC to near line on the HDD side has gone through this big digestion phase. And I think enterprise SSD was the one we were waiting to see when we're going to come out of that. And that's what we're starting to see. So we're seeing a couple of dynamics in that market. We're seeing those enterprise SSDs that we had qualified, the very same products now we're getting orders for as that digestion phase ends and they get -- they start to ramp ordering back. And then we're seeing the kind of AI impact on different capacity points, different use for model training we're starting to see that demand come in the market. So we're seeing both of those things happen. We think the portfolio is well positioned for those markets. We expect that to play out through the rest of the year and we're excited about it.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. On the HDD side, you had a very outsized exabyte quarter-on-quarter growth in the quarter relative to your nearest competitor. How are you thinking about the continued trajectory here in terms of exabyte growth perhaps both quarter-on-quarter basis, but also maybe calendar '24 versus calendar '23.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. We're seeing -- I mean, big picture we're seeing a return in demand. Obviously, I think it was the largest sequential exabyte growth we've seen in a very long time. I hesitate to say ever because this is -- business has been around a very long time. But to go back as far as we could look, it was the biggest sequential increase we had seen. And it's -- as I said earlier that starts with having products that really resonate with our customers. We really believe very strongly in the technology road map we've built around ePMR and UltraSMR and is resonating very strongly with customers. Nearly 50% of exabytes shipped this quarter was SMR and we're set up well for what we talked about last time where we expect over half of our exabytes in FY '25 to be SMR-based. So like we said, coming into the fiscal year that we expected sequential growth throughout the fiscal year last quarter we extended that to the calendar year and we still see that. So we still see sequential exabyte growth going forward throughout this calendar year.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, on sort of reinvesting on capacity side, on the HDD side. I think you said when conditions are ripe for reinvesting, and I know to Aaron's question earlier you commented on certain gross margin ranges, but this cycle, your gross margin is much higher at lower revenue levels than past cycles. So clearly it feels as though at least you have the capability to drive peak margins much higher than your established long-term range. So why should 33 be maybe the level at which you reinvest? Why wouldn't it be 34, 35 or higher than that?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, we haven't really set a bogey for that. We want to look at the holistic marketing. Again, that -- I understand this question everybody is looking for when we would reinvest, but that's really not what we're even thinking about right now. We're thinking about getting a market that's balanced on supply and demand, delivering great products to our customers that can meet the needs of the growth of the cloud. And I think that to your point, I think the business is emerging what we planned for and a lot of hard work that went in over the last couple of years which is to come back in a much healthier position with the ability to drive greater profitability. So we're just getting back to the bottom of the range that we set a couple of years ago. It's not as if we're declaring victory in that at all to your point, like I said, I feel like we're just getting back to the starting line of where we need to drive the business to, but we feel very good about to be able to drive increased profitability in it. Look, it starts with delivering great products to your customers like we have to continue to bring better TCO. And I think we have got a tremendous architecture to do that while controlling our cost to build the product. We have to work stay focused on both sides of this equation. We got to have the lowest cost and then the best TCO that allows us to drive pricing which drives margin expansion. So we're working across that whole equation. And I think the strategy is working quite well. And that's why we saw -- when we saw some -- we saw the demand return, we saw the margins pop up. But to your point, we believe we can -- we're just getting started on this.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\nKarl Ackerman: I'm curious your thoughts on the decision to prioritize the transition to BiCS 8 for the mobile market rather than SSDs because AI demand appears concentrated in high-capacity enterprise SSDs. And I guess as you address that question, could you discuss your opportunity to provide QLC enterprise SSD to address these inference applications that appear to be supporting 30 and 60-terabyte units.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Thanks, Karl. So haven't really said where BiCS 8 is going to go. That's in our future. That's one thing we feel really good about is the technology is there and we'll bring it to market when we see it's the right time to do that when we got the right profitability, the right supply-demand characteristics to invest in prioritizing that node, the technology is in great shape. But we haven't really outlined exactly which products are going to go there first or second or third. So that's still in our future. As far as your point on QLC, this is -- we're now starting to transition to BiCS 6. And so we talked about a couple -- a number of products here that are BiCS 6 based which first the client SSD, you didn't -- I'll talk about enterprise SSD as well, but we our client SSD has been extremely well received. The performance of it is outstanding. We have our own internal controller team. They've done an amazing job of building a really, really high-performance QLC client SSD. We expect that to lead the market and lead that transition in that part of the market and then we're bringing BiCS 6 into our enterprise SSDs as well. So that will be lever we have to drive BiCS 6 which gives us more capacity, better performance and so we feel good about that transition is now starting and the products are starting to show up. They're in customers' hands, and they've been very, very well received.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ \u2013 Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I have two questions as well, I guess. First on the HDD side, I'm wondering, do you think given some of the challenges on Hammer qualifications that Seagate's having, if you potentially saw a bigger uplift in market on the near line side and you think that market share could potentially sustain or does some of that kind of flow back as those qualifications get done. So I'd love to understand if the share gains you think you're seeing are sustainable or not. And then on the flash side I would like to just maybe get your perspective. I know you folks are talking about bit growth being flat in June. But as some of these qualifications ramp up in the back half how do you think about bit growth ramping up into the back half of this calendar year?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So on the first question, the business with our customers is planned pretty far in advance. So there wouldn't be a situation where something would happen intra-quarter and that would drive a big share shift. The reality is we've got great products, and they're very much resonating with our customers and we can deliver them at scale. And they have bring best-in-class TCO and clearly customers are adopting those at a significant rate. So -- like is it sustainable? We continue to bring great products to market. That's what we plan to do. We're very confident in our road map on HDD and we'll continue to bring the best TCO solutions to our customers. On bit growth, we do expect flat bit growth into the calendar Q2, but we'll see a pickup in bit growth in the second half of the year.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. Another question on enterprise is so you guys have been really smart on how you are allocating flash bits, right, with a strong focus on profitability. So as you reallocate more bits towards eSSD in the second half, is the profitability profile of enterprise SSD portfolio expected to be accretive to the overall flash business and your shares peaked previously sort of in that sort of high single-digit percentage range in enterprise. Just given a more competitive portfolio, like what type of share is the team targeting kind of mid- to longer term?\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay. Thanks, Harlan, your questions are very related. So we saw a pickup in enterprise SSD in the March quarter. It's still -- quite honestly, it's still relatively small numbers, but it's growing quite well. So we wouldn't have supplied those bits if it wasn't the right thing to do from a portfolio strategy point of view. We'll see when we get to the second half, what pricing looks like, that versus other options we have, and then we'll decide how much supply we put into those products. And you're really getting into core of our portfolio strategy, which is to have a lot of optionality. We have a lot of optionality across client SSD, across gaming, now across enterprise SSD, across mobile, across consumer, obviously, which is a big business for us. And then based on what we see going into the quarter. And then very importantly, what happens during the quarter, how do we allocate our supply to get the best return? And clearly, we're in an environment right now where things got better throughout the quarter. So as we go through the quarter, we find more opportunity to mix and get more profitability, and that's what happened in the March quarter, and you saw the results of having that agility into the business. So I really don't want to call a share number or anything like that because it tends to distort, what we want to do is maximize profitability, not maximize share in any particular market. We want to maximize where we get the most return for our supply.\nHarlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then maybe a question on BiCS 8. I know you're not calling out any timing yet, but you have had it sort of in preproduction for quite some time. How are the early yields on this technology? And I guess, more importantly, like can the team still drive mid-teens percentage annualized type cost down with the new bonded the raise technology?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. So what I'll say about yields is we're very confident in the technology. I mean, we feel very, very good about it. It's a major advancement in the architecture OptiNAND from an industry perspective to the CBA architecture. And it's -- the development has gone well. We feel very good about it. We can productize it when we need it. Again, this gets into a larger conversation about the dynamics of the market and when is the supply needed, and we're going to be very, very disciplined about going through any transition or putting any CapEx to the market until we see the profitability that we want to get. So we feel very good about BiCS 8. There was a second part of the question.\nHarlan Sur: On the cost downs.\nDavid Goeckeler: Cost downs.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, maybe I'll take that, Harlan. Yes. On the cost down, we're still anticipating the mid-teens percentage year-on-year cost downs. So there's no change there.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Harlan.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Colorado from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nCarlos Colorado: Thanks for taking my question. So I have -- the first one is about nearline. You are going outperforming your competition by a lot. So what are the underlying reasons in your opinion for this? And do we have to expect this to normalize over time? And do you think this can be sustained? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, the performance of the HD business is driven by the product, right? It's pretty straightforward. Products are -- they're great products. This architecture that we built on ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR, customers are really committed to SMR. They deliver the best TCO in the market. We can produce them at scale and that's what leads to the performance.\nCarlos Colorado: Okay. Thanks and the follow-up is, you mentioned that AI has revenues are of SSD sales. You have a perfect vantage point to see if AI is driving applications that traditionally were HDD is that now being transferred to SSD some of those applications, or is the classic question on cannibalization from one to the other. Is that -- is AI change in that scenario? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: We do not see any cannibalization clearly, HDD plays a big role in the AI storage life cycle as well as the whole ingest phase because all of the big data lakes and all of the raw data sets, those are all going to be stored on HDD. It's just the economics of where you store that data and how do you access that data. It's all that part of the AI pipeline, if you will, is going to be HDD. Now you have all of these other new use cases around training and inference, and those are all going to be SSDs. So it's really about growth as opposed to substitution. And that's what's so exciting about this. And obviously, once you get the models trained, then the models are going to turn out more data, which is going to be stored on HDD. So you got this virtuous cycle going. So it's kind of literally rising tide lifts all boats. It's not a substitution game. Clearly, there's a lot of new use cases being developed around AI, like the whole training infrastructures that are being built, that's what's driving these very high-capacity storage-based enterprise SSDs that we're seeing demand for. So hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one on flash for Dave. You spoke about the BiCS 6 hyperscale qualifying it. My understanding was a BiCS 6 was kind of more like a sub node and BiCS 8 is going to be the bigger one. I'm just kind of curious to get to your enterprise SSD market share target. Do you really need BiCS 8, or can you achieve it with BiCS 6? And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Goeckeler: You're right. BiCS 6 is when we say stub node, it's we're not going to take the whole portfolio to BiCS 6. So we have a big portfolio, and we're choosing which products to take the BiCS 6. And clearly, we're taking the products that require QLC and the kind of things you're talking about. So we feel good about our node a plan in the fab being able to supply what we need in these markets.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. And then, Dave, on the hard drive side, I think you said in the past that you can get to 40 terabytes of the ePMR technology. I'm just kind of curious with obviously a competitor like trying to ramp up HAMR, and it took them a while like a few years to even get the 3 terabytes per disk in R&D to [indiscernible]. Can you give us an update on your HAMR road map or the status of your HAMR technology, how we think about 30, 40 terabytes plus.\nDavid Goeckeler: So we've been working on HAMR for quite some time. We understand HAMR extremely well. We understand all the issues with HAMR, and what it takes to get it qualified. Clearly, we're doing that all behind the scenes because we have a product portfolio with the best TCO we can offer in the market today, and we can do that all the way up to 40 terabytes. And 40 terabytes is where the economics flip over and you get the 4 terabyte per platter or 40 per unit, where essentially the capacity increase will cancel out the increase in costs you have to put in the unit to get the economics to work on margin, right? That's kind of a complicated -- a lot to say in 1 sentence. But our portfolio is very focused on the right product with the right cost at the right time. The right time for HAMR is at 40 terabytes. And we've got a lot of development going on that product. We have for a long time. We, quite frankly, don't need to do it in public because we have another portfolio that's selling extremely well, which we've talked about throughout this process. But have a lot of confidence in our HAMR development. And quite frankly, our customers know exactly what we're doing, and where we're at and what our plans are, and they're comfortable with that as well.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, David.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nTom O'Malley: Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to do one on the CFO side real quick on OpEx. So big step up in the June quarter, and you're talking about some special projects. How should we think about that progressing? Is that investments that are going to stick around for the next couple of quarters? Or should that reset back to kind of the lower base you've been running out? You've just seen OpEx move from kind of the 550 to 660 over the past year, obviously, revenue increasing as well, but any color there on what that investment is for and if you see a step down after that?\nWissam Jabre: Yes. Sure, Tom. So let me first start by saying that the way we think of OpEx is we don't see OpEx increasing faster than revenue. So we're still very focused on that cost discipline and OpEx discipline. When it comes to this quarter, we're expecting some increase. The increase is almost 50-50 driven by variable comp as the financial outlook has improved much faster than anticipated. So there's a bit of increase there. But also, as you mentioned, there's some project-specific R&D investments that also -- that we have sort of a direct correlation and line of sight to revenue. I would say for the next couple of quarters, the range that we've guided for Q4 is a reasonable range. I know it's too early to talk about fiscal year '25. But for modelling purposes, we can use the same type of numbers for now.\nTom O'Malley: Helpful. And if I look at your cost guidance for the year, a couple kind of with what you're looking at for June of '24, when I'm looking at gross margins, it seems like you need to have a pretty significant step-up in HDD gross margins. Are you planning for all of that the underutilization to come out of the model in the June quarter? And if any remains, can you let us know how much you're expecting?\nWissam Jabre: So for this most recent -- for Q3, we had a little bit -- and we disclosed, we talked about those. But as you can see, the numbers are becoming less and less significant. And so for the June quarter, there's still a little bit, but it's not really very significant for us to talk about on this call.\nTom O'Malley: Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, Tom.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.\nVijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. David, Wissam. Just a quick question on the Flash side. Dave, when you look at the profitability, as you mentioned, how does the BiCS 6 compare to -- if you look at some of the competitive NAND out there, either in terms of die size or cost per gig versus some of the peers?\nWissam Jabre: So that's a very complicated question. I mean we can go into it in detail offline. We obviously do tons of work, and I appreciate your question that it's a multifaceted issue. It's die size, it's memory hole density, it's all kinds of very complicated thing goes into producing a NAND product. Look, we think the product compares extremely favorable. We think it leads the market. Again, for the last -- looking back many years, we have been able to produce bits at one third less CapEx than the industry average, and we expect BiCS 8 to continue that leadership in the market. So we feel very, very good about the product, about its performance. Again, when you build, this is like kind of one of the magic of wafer bonding. You can build the CMOS separately from the NAND stack and then the CMOS is kind of pristine. So the interfaces are really, really fast. So there's lots of good things about that architecture that leads to a really, really market-leading product, and we feel good about it. And we've got that all ready to go when the market the market conditions will support that level of investment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Most of the good questions have been asked. But David, I just have a longer-term question, and I think it will help many investors let's say, prices were to go sideways in '25, and you're just focusing on that 15% cost down and higher mix of higher-value SSD products. Can you help us understand how your flash margins would evolve from here? And then I'm not trying to ask you for pricing. But I'm just wondering how we could gauge your execution first, on the product mix and be on the cost down and how they both would manifest into higher margins.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. Then let me first start with -- I'll take a stab at the answer, Mehdi. So look, our target model hasn't changed. We're still targeting through cycle for the flush business to be 35%, gross margin to be between 35% to 37%. And so that means, obviously, as -- from where we are today, we still have some ways to go to get to that through cycle margin. And the way we achieve these gross margins is what we've been talking about on this call. We focus on the product portfolio, the bit placement as well as on the cost side, which we still anticipate a similar type of ranges in terms of cost downs.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. That's reasonable. Let me just move on to the second question. And this is something I always ask, focusing on HDD. Is there any update how you see exabyte shipment evolving like over the next couple of years? Is the target now 25% to 30% or less or more?\nDavid Goeckeler: We're not -- we're still in the 20% to 25% camp, maybe around 25%. That's -- we're clearly in a cyclical recovery here, getting back to that kind of through-cycle number. I think the kind of the question inside your question is how much does AI add on to that. And I think it's still a little early to tell. We definitely see -- as I talked about earlier, we see the value of data going up, you want to store more data to train more models. Those models are going to turn out more data. So we think that the bias is higher. I'm not in a position yet to call exactly how much it changes the slope of that line. So that's something we're going to stay very focused on as we go forward here over the next several quarters, stay close to our customers as these models get deployed and AI gets more broadly deployed and adopted so that we can dial in what we expect that impact to be on HDD storage demand. But we feel good that it's -- and we've got that secular tailwind to the business that will emerge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Two quick ones for me. First of all, on the HDD side, your large competitors talked about having to sort of support the supply chain going forward. I was wondering what -- how you look at that option or need to do that? And then secondly, since cash flows turned positive again, I was wondering if you could sort of give us a little bit of help on how to think cash flow tracks maybe versus net income or EBITDA over the next few quarters? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: I'll just say something about supply chain. Look, we stay -- we've stayed very close to our suppliers throughout the entire downturn and stay very close to them as we're planning the business going forward. So we think we always support our supply chain and Irwin Tan, who leads operations is based in Singapore, a lot of our suppliers are there, and he personally can stay very, very close to them. So we've stayed we've been very close and have supported our supply chain throughout this entire downturn. And now as things are getting better, that's a good situation for all of us. You want to talk about the cash flow?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, let me take that. So on the cash flow, yes, thanks. Obviously, we returned to free cash flow positive in Q3. And as the revenue and the business continues to recover, we're completely focused on profitability and cash flow generation. So we should expect that to improve from here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes, thanks guys for taking the question. Just one for me. David, really, I think, piggybacking off the part of Mehdi's question. So just a TAM question on both sides of the business, HDD and Flash, is really the spirit of it that you see some near-term demand from AI coming and TBD on the impact to the TAM over time and also TBD on impact to the normalized growth rate off of whatever the new TAM looks like. And that's really the question. And TBD is the financing, but I just wanted to make sure we get all of your current opinions there. Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: I think that's a fair way to say it. I think it's coming into focus as to where it's going to show up on both sides of the business, but it's -- to your point, we're not ready to call what it does to the TAM, besides, we believe, it's a tailwind to both TAMs. So clearly, on the NAND business, there's very specific use cases on model training that are coming up substantially. I mean, obviously, you're seeing that across the whole technology landscape. And maybe that's a little bit easier to see we're actually seeing demand for those kind of products in the second half. And for HDD, we see it as all the data that's going to feed that process is going to sit on HDDs. And obviously, once those models get trained, they're going to turn out data that's 85% plus of that is going to be stored on HDD. So we see a very, very good setup, but we're staying close to our customers in these markets. It's still a little bit early to actually put a number on it of what it does to the growth rate or the TAM size.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nTristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. A quick follow-up on this, which is how critical is it to have U.S. manufacturing for SSDs in relation to AI? And how do you look at partnership with hyperscalers as opposed to more kind of a general purpose business.\nDavid Goeckeler: You mean U.S. manufacturing of the NAND itself or the SSD, which -- well, our NAND is manufactured in Japan. So we don't see that as -- we feel really good about our manufacturing footprint, by the way. So the JV, we haven't talked at all on this call about the JV, but that puts us in a great position from a scale perspective and gives us -- is the big underlying part of that low-cost lowest-cost bids, low capital efficiency and great product road map because we -- all of that is done in tandem with Kioxia, and so we're able to invest as the largest supplier in the market, which is a great position to be in. But we haven't -- the way our footprint is set up for a manufacturing point of view, we haven't seen anything that impairs us ability to serve the entire market. And as far as partnership with hyperscalers, like, look, we stay very close to the hyperscalers. Obviously, they're big customers of ours. We're big suppliers of theirs on both sides of the business. So we're very, very close to them and staying close to what are different use cases, how do they want the products built especially in the enterprise SSD market, every -- there's not just one enterprise SSD. Everybody uses slightly different interfaces and there's different ways, their architecture of their data centers are built. So we stay close to them to make sure we build the right product for what we're -- what the markets we want to serve.\nOperator: And at this time, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to David for any closing remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate all of the questions, and we look forward to talking to everybody throughout the quarter. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call to discuss our third quarter of fiscal year 2024 performance. Western Digital delivered excellent results in the quarter with revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 29.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, all of which exceeded expectations. Our strategy of developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets, coupled with structural changes we have made to both of our businesses, is unlocking our true earnings potential and allowing us to continue improving through-cycle profitability and dampening business cycles. This strategy enables us to generate higher earnings per share even in a constrained supply environment. In addition, our commitment to achieving operational efficiency and enhancing our agility has allowed us to run our flash and HDD businesses more efficiently and further drive innovation to take advantage of new opportunities. In particular, as the technology landscape continues to evolve, the demand for AI solutions is becoming increasingly apparent across our end markets. The uptick in AI adoption is highlighting the incredible value of data and will drive increased storage demand across both HDD and flash at the edge and in the core, providing greater long-term growth and margin expansion opportunities for Western Digital. We are in the early innings of unlocking the full potential of this company, and our team remains focused on improving the profitability of our business to drive long-term margin expansion and shareholder value as these new demand opportunities present themselves. Before I dive further into the demand environment, I want to briefly comment on the status of the separation of our flash and HDD businesses. I am proud of the team's ongoing efforts as we drive towards completion of the separation in the second half of the calendar year. We remain focused on achieving the separation as soon as possible, and we'll continue to provide further updates on our progress as appropriate. Moving on to end market commentary. I am pleased to report that during the quarter, revenue in all of our major end markets returned to year-over-year growth. In cloud, we experienced 29% growth in revenue from a year ago, highlighting the incredible success of our industry-leading HDD product line. In addition, we began to experience an increase in demand for our flash-based solutions, signaling a long-awaited recovery in this end market. In client, 20% revenue growth from a year ago was driven by increased bit demand for our flash-based solutions, coupled with an increase in ASPs. In consumer, we experienced 17% revenue growth from a year ago, highlighting the power of the SanDisk premium brand. Higher flash bit sales, combined with a better pricing environment more than offset the continued decline in consumer HDD demand. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with flash. Our sequential revenue growth in the quarter reflects the continuing commitment to disciplined capital spending and carefully optimizing bit shipments into our most profitable end markets to take advantage of the improved pricing environment. This approach, combined with the strength of our product portfolio has enabled us to drive significantly higher profitability while strategically managing our inventory. On the technology front, we achieved a significant milestone by initiating mass production of our QLC-based client SSD, leveraging BiCS 6 technology. This is yet another significant milestone demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. These advancements pave the way to spearhead the market's transition to QLC-based flash solutions in calendar year 2024. Additionally, our progress with BiCS 8 is on track. While this technology is ready to be productized as market conditions warrant, our innovative offerings will remain at the forefront of the market, further strengthening our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. As noted earlier, in the third quarter, we began to experience an increase in demand for our enterprise SSD solutions. We are seeing demand returning for NVMe SSDs that we qualified before the downturn. We are also experiencing significant interest in providing these products in dramatically higher capacities for AI-related applications which we expect to ship in the second half of the year. In addition, we are also sampling our newest high-performance PCIe Gen 5, BiCS 6-based enterprise SSD. We are preparing for qualification at a hyperscaler and the product is generating significant interest in the enterprise market. We expect to ramp in the second half of the calendar year. Turning to HDD. The sequential revenue increase was driven by improved nearline demand and higher pricing as we focused on optimizing profitability per exabyte sold. In particular, nearline revenue reached a fixed quarter high, reflecting the successful strategy we put in place to bring the most innovative, high-capacity and high-performance drives to market. We have the right products at the right cost structure, which are reflected in our financial performance. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR with our 26-terabyte and 28-terabyte UltraSMR drives, quickly becoming a significant portion of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipments. SMR-based drives represented approximately 50% of nearline exabyte shipments in the quarter. Our portfolio strategy to commercialize ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies in advance of our transition to HAMR, has proven to be the winning strategy and enables us to deliver to customers the industry's highest capacity and leading TCO drives, all of which can be produced at scale with controlled costs. We are confident that our product strategy, which combines UltraSMR technology with upcoming advancements in nearline drives is enabling Western Digital to deliver best-in-class gross margin in HDDs all at a time when AI is emerging as another growth engine for the industry. As we move toward a new supply and demand environment, characterized by higher demand, supply tightness and product shortages, we are leveraging our proven technology we've already introduced to the market to meet the demands of our customers with the right portfolio at the right time, while also operating with a lean cost structure for continued profitability improvement in our HDD business. Although the actions we are taking have improved profitability, we remain focused on driving higher margins to appropriately value the incredible amount of innovation and TCO improvements we continue to deliver to our customers. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. Within Flash, in addition to growth opportunities at the edge, which is Western Digital strength, we are encouraged by the returning demand within the enterprise SSD market and expect growth throughout this calendar year. AI-related workloads are driving increasing demand for enterprise SSDs, and our portfolio is well positioned to support those use cases. Looking ahead, we anticipate bit shipments to remain flat into the fiscal fourth quarter and look to Flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver led by our focus on allocating bits to the most high-value end markets amidst the tightening supply environment. While we're pleased to see pricing trends moving in a positive direction, it's crucial to acknowledge the importance of maintaining capital discipline and only reinvesting capital back into the business once profitability improves further, and we see sustained demand. Overall, our continued focus on improving profitability through our innovation road map, disciplined capital spending and strategic pricing initiatives position us well for continued success in calendar year 2024 and into 2025 by offering the most capital and cost-efficient bits in the industry. In HDD, the success of our portfolio of leading capacity enterprise products, combined with the restructuring efforts we've implemented in recent years are yielding improved unit economics and greater visibility. As cloud demand is recovering, we anticipate continued growth driven by higher nearline demand and better pricing as we are now in a supply-constrained environment. We're optimistic about aligning the pricing of our products to better mirror the innovation we are integrating into them, supporting long-term margin expansion in our HDD business. As we reap the rewards of the innovation and operational efficiencies that we've implemented, we will look for opportunities to reinvest in the business when the conditions are ripe for expansion. We will approach every capital allocation decision with a focus on discipline. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial third quarter results. Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. I'm pleased with the team's performance in developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets. As industry supply and demand dynamics continue to improve, we will remain disciplined around our capital spending and focused on driving innovation and efficiency across our business. Coupled with the structural changes we have made to our businesses, we are confident in our ability to drive greater through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As we move forward, we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on the promising growth prospects that lie ahead, solidifying our leadership position in the industry, particularly as AI continues to drive new storage solution opportunities and growth. Okay. Peter, let's start the Q&A. Hi, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- the HDD business, we're really happy with where the portfolio is at. I think that's where it starts, bringing great products to market that deliver the highest capacity points and the best TCO for our customers and when we're able to do that, we can share in more of that TCO advantage we're bringing to market. I think that's been the strategy for quite some time, and we're really happy with where the portfolio is and it's really resonating with customers. But the other side of that is making sure we really control the cost side of it, so we're really focused on making sure we bring the lowest cost product as well and that leads to the margin expansion. And then we -- of course, we've got a returning demand environment as we get the cyclical recovery in HDD spending coming off of the lows that we all really understand. Going forward, we talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks. We expect to continue to bring great products to market. We expect to continue to drive better TCO for our customers and we're in an environment now where we have supply/demand balance and we've -- significant restructuring of our business during the downturn. We've taken capacity -- we've set our capacity of what we think the market needs as we emerge into this demand environment. We do see better supply/demand alignment. We see tightness in the market, that's leading to what you would expect as customers giving us more visibility into what their ordering looks like going forward. So we're optimistic about being able to continue to drive profitability of this business higher. You mean for our -- for what time period, just to make sure I understand your question? Calendar '24, look, we see -- yes, we still see demand in the mid to -- call it, the mid- to high teens for the market. We see supply like about 8% of bits in production. So we still see an undersupplied market. For us, we had bits down this quarter, we forecast them down double digits. We were right about that, maybe a little bit more flat going into next quarter as we kind of optimize our supply throughout the year where we can think we can get the best profitability. Thank you C.J. Yes. So what I would say about the AI demand as it's coming into focus. I don't think it's so much in the results just yet, but we're seeing where it's going to impact both businesses. And clearly, one of them you just outlined, which is we're seeing enterprise SSD demand return, we saw some increase in the last quarter. We expect some increase in this quarter. But really, as we look to the second half, we have customers coming to us wanting the kind of SSDs we built and qualified before the downturn. They just want them in much bigger capacity points, 30 and 60 terabyte capacity points. So it's the same product just taking it and increasing capacity and going through a qualification on that so we're in that process with customers. We also introduced a new SSD that's more compute focused, which is PCIe Gen 5 product based on BiCS 6, very high performance that plays a little bit different role in the AI training stack and we're getting very good feedback on that product. It's being qualified by our starting qualification, we samples. We're kind of getting rid of the qualification of the hyperscaler and we're seeing good demand in the enterprise market as well. So we feel like the portfolio set up well as we go into the second half, and we're seeing a lot of demand show up for people that are very building large amount of infrastructure for model training. Thanks, Joe. Yes. That's how we're thinking about it. This is a -- I've talked about this quite a bit and this is an industry that I think has been oversupplied with this client-to-cloud transition, it's been going on for 15 years. I think the downturn was in time when we saw a significant change in demand to say the least that we just decided to remove capacity to get supply and demand better balance. So as we -- we're just emerging into that market, Aaron. I mean I think as we start to see this market play out and dynamics get to the kind of business model and get more visibility into what the future is. We can have confidence in making investments if that's what we need to do to expand capacity I think as all of that comes into focus, and it's starting to happen. We're starting to see that. We're getting more visibility. We're getting to participate more in the TCO advantages that we're bringing to the market. We're seeing better dynamics and as that continues -- and we get more confidence, we're not there yet, then we would think about how do we bring more capacity into the market? But we're just at the -- we're kind of getting to the starting line is, I guess, what I would say. Yes, you got -- I mean it's the -- what we're seeing now is when the market is coming back we're seeing those customers now come back up to a very long digestion period. And this is something we've been waiting for quite some time. Like every market from consumer to PC to near line on the HDD side has gone through this big digestion phase. And I think enterprise SSD was the one we were waiting to see when we're going to come out of that. And that's what we're starting to see. So we're seeing a couple of dynamics in that market. We're seeing those enterprise SSDs that we had qualified, the very same products now we're getting orders for as that digestion phase ends and they get -- they start to ramp ordering back. And then we're seeing the kind of AI impact on different capacity points, different use for model training we're starting to see that demand come in the market. So we're seeing both of those things happen. We think the portfolio is well positioned for those markets. We expect that to play out through the rest of the year and we're excited about it. Thanks. Yes. We're seeing -- I mean, big picture we're seeing a return in demand. Obviously, I think it was the largest sequential exabyte growth we've seen in a very long time. I hesitate to say ever because this is -- business has been around a very long time. But to go back as far as we could look, it was the biggest sequential increase we had seen. And it's -- as I said earlier that starts with having products that really resonate with our customers. We really believe very strongly in the technology road map we've built around ePMR and UltraSMR and is resonating very strongly with customers. Nearly 50% of exabytes shipped this quarter was SMR and we're set up well for what we talked about last time where we expect over half of our exabytes in FY '25 to be SMR-based. So like we said, coming into the fiscal year that we expected sequential growth throughout the fiscal year last quarter we extended that to the calendar year and we still see that. So we still see sequential exabyte growth going forward throughout this calendar year. Well, we haven't really set a bogey for that. We want to look at the holistic marketing. Again, that -- I understand this question everybody is looking for when we would reinvest, but that's really not what we're even thinking about right now. We're thinking about getting a market that's balanced on supply and demand, delivering great products to our customers that can meet the needs of the growth of the cloud. And I think that to your point, I think the business is emerging what we planned for and a lot of hard work that went in over the last couple of years which is to come back in a much healthier position with the ability to drive greater profitability. So we're just getting back to the bottom of the range that we set a couple of years ago. It's not as if we're declaring victory in that at all to your point, like I said, I feel like we're just getting back to the starting line of where we need to drive the business to, but we feel very good about to be able to drive increased profitability in it. Look, it starts with delivering great products to your customers like we have to continue to bring better TCO. And I think we have got a tremendous architecture to do that while controlling our cost to build the product. We have to work stay focused on both sides of this equation. We got to have the lowest cost and then the best TCO that allows us to drive pricing which drives margin expansion. So we're working across that whole equation. And I think the strategy is working quite well. And that's why we saw -- when we saw some -- we saw the demand return, we saw the margins pop up. But to your point, we believe we can -- we're just getting started on this. Yes. Thanks, Karl. So haven't really said where BiCS 8 is going to go. That's in our future. That's one thing we feel really good about is the technology is there and we'll bring it to market when we see it's the right time to do that when we got the right profitability, the right supply-demand characteristics to invest in prioritizing that node, the technology is in great shape. But we haven't really outlined exactly which products are going to go there first or second or third. So that's still in our future. As far as your point on QLC, this is -- we're now starting to transition to BiCS 6. And so we talked about a couple -- a number of products here that are BiCS 6 based which first the client SSD, you didn't -- I'll talk about enterprise SSD as well, but we our client SSD has been extremely well received. The performance of it is outstanding. We have our own internal controller team. They've done an amazing job of building a really, really high-performance QLC client SSD. We expect that to lead the market and lead that transition in that part of the market and then we're bringing BiCS 6 into our enterprise SSDs as well. So that will be lever we have to drive BiCS 6 which gives us more capacity, better performance and so we feel good about that transition is now starting and the products are starting to show up. They're in customers' hands, and they've been very, very well received. Thanks, Karl. Yes. So on the first question, the business with our customers is planned pretty far in advance. So there wouldn't be a situation where something would happen intra-quarter and that would drive a big share shift. The reality is we've got great products, and they're very much resonating with our customers and we can deliver them at scale. And they have bring best-in-class TCO and clearly customers are adopting those at a significant rate. So -- like is it sustainable? We continue to bring great products to market. That's what we plan to do. We're very confident in our road map on HDD and we'll continue to bring the best TCO solutions to our customers. On bit growth, we do expect flat bit growth into the calendar Q2, but we'll see a pickup in bit growth in the second half of the year. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Harlan, your questions are very related. So we saw a pickup in enterprise SSD in the March quarter. It's still -- quite honestly, it's still relatively small numbers, but it's growing quite well. So we wouldn't have supplied those bits if it wasn't the right thing to do from a portfolio strategy point of view. We'll see when we get to the second half, what pricing looks like, that versus other options we have, and then we'll decide how much supply we put into those products. And you're really getting into core of our portfolio strategy, which is to have a lot of optionality. We have a lot of optionality across client SSD, across gaming, now across enterprise SSD, across mobile, across consumer, obviously, which is a big business for us. And then based on what we see going into the quarter. And then very importantly, what happens during the quarter, how do we allocate our supply to get the best return? And clearly, we're in an environment right now where things got better throughout the quarter. So as we go through the quarter, we find more opportunity to mix and get more profitability, and that's what happened in the March quarter, and you saw the results of having that agility into the business. So I really don't want to call a share number or anything like that because it tends to distort, what we want to do is maximize profitability, not maximize share in any particular market. We want to maximize where we get the most return for our supply. Yes. So what I'll say about yields is we're very confident in the technology. I mean, we feel very, very good about it. It's a major advancement in the architecture OptiNAND from an industry perspective to the CBA architecture. And it's -- the development has gone well. We feel very good about it. We can productize it when we need it. Again, this gets into a larger conversation about the dynamics of the market and when is the supply needed, and we're going to be very, very disciplined about going through any transition or putting any CapEx to the market until we see the profitability that we want to get. So we feel very good about BiCS 8. There was a second part of the question. Cost downs. Thanks, Harlan. Yes, the performance of the HD business is driven by the product, right? It's pretty straightforward. Products are -- they're great products. This architecture that we built on ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR, customers are really committed to SMR. They deliver the best TCO in the market. We can produce them at scale and that's what leads to the performance. We do not see any cannibalization clearly, HDD plays a big role in the AI storage life cycle as well as the whole ingest phase because all of the big data lakes and all of the raw data sets, those are all going to be stored on HDD. It's just the economics of where you store that data and how do you access that data. It's all that part of the AI pipeline, if you will, is going to be HDD. Now you have all of these other new use cases around training and inference, and those are all going to be SSDs. So it's really about growth as opposed to substitution. And that's what's so exciting about this. And obviously, once you get the models trained, then the models are going to turn out more data, which is going to be stored on HDD. So you got this virtuous cycle going. So it's kind of literally rising tide lifts all boats. It's not a substitution game. Clearly, there's a lot of new use cases being developed around AI, like the whole training infrastructures that are being built, that's what's driving these very high-capacity storage-based enterprise SSDs that we're seeing demand for. So hopefully, that helps. You're right. BiCS 6 is when we say stub node, it's we're not going to take the whole portfolio to BiCS 6. So we have a big portfolio, and we're choosing which products to take the BiCS 6. And clearly, we're taking the products that require QLC and the kind of things you're talking about. So we feel good about our node a plan in the fab being able to supply what we need in these markets. So we've been working on HAMR for quite some time. We understand HAMR extremely well. We understand all the issues with HAMR, and what it takes to get it qualified. Clearly, we're doing that all behind the scenes because we have a product portfolio with the best TCO we can offer in the market today, and we can do that all the way up to 40 terabytes. And 40 terabytes is where the economics flip over and you get the 4 terabyte per platter or 40 per unit, where essentially the capacity increase will cancel out the increase in costs you have to put in the unit to get the economics to work on margin, right? That's kind of a complicated -- a lot to say in 1 sentence. But our portfolio is very focused on the right product with the right cost at the right time. The right time for HAMR is at 40 terabytes. And we've got a lot of development going on that product. We have for a long time. We, quite frankly, don't need to do it in public because we have another portfolio that's selling extremely well, which we've talked about throughout this process. But have a lot of confidence in our HAMR development. And quite frankly, our customers know exactly what we're doing, and where we're at and what our plans are, and they're comfortable with that as well. Thanks, Tom. We're not -- we're still in the 20% to 25% camp, maybe around 25%. That's -- we're clearly in a cyclical recovery here, getting back to that kind of through-cycle number. I think the kind of the question inside your question is how much does AI add on to that. And I think it's still a little early to tell. We definitely see -- as I talked about earlier, we see the value of data going up, you want to store more data to train more models. Those models are going to turn out more data. So we think that the bias is higher. I'm not in a position yet to call exactly how much it changes the slope of that line. So that's something we're going to stay very focused on as we go forward here over the next several quarters, stay close to our customers as these models get deployed and AI gets more broadly deployed and adopted so that we can dial in what we expect that impact to be on HDD storage demand. But we feel good that it's -- and we've got that secular tailwind to the business that will emerge. I'll just say something about supply chain. Look, we stay -- we've stayed very close to our suppliers throughout the entire downturn and stay very close to them as we're planning the business going forward. So we think we always support our supply chain and Irwin Tan, who leads operations is based in Singapore, a lot of our suppliers are there, and he personally can stay very, very close to them. So we've stayed we've been very close and have supported our supply chain throughout this entire downturn. And now as things are getting better, that's a good situation for all of us. You want to talk about the cash flow? I think that's a fair way to say it. I think it's coming into focus as to where it's going to show up on both sides of the business, but it's -- to your point, we're not ready to call what it does to the TAM, besides, we believe, it's a tailwind to both TAMs. So clearly, on the NAND business, there's very specific use cases on model training that are coming up substantially. I mean, obviously, you're seeing that across the whole technology landscape. And maybe that's a little bit easier to see we're actually seeing demand for those kind of products in the second half. And for HDD, we see it as all the data that's going to feed that process is going to sit on HDDs. And obviously, once those models get trained, they're going to turn out data that's 85% plus of that is going to be stored on HDD. So we see a very, very good setup, but we're staying close to our customers in these markets. It's still a little bit early to actually put a number on it of what it does to the growth rate or the TAM size. You mean U.S. manufacturing of the NAND itself or the SSD, which -- well, our NAND is manufactured in Japan. So we don't see that as -- we feel really good about our manufacturing footprint, by the way. So the JV, we haven't talked at all on this call about the JV, but that puts us in a great position from a scale perspective and gives us -- is the big underlying part of that low-cost lowest-cost bids, low capital efficiency and great product road map because we -- all of that is done in tandem with Kioxia, and so we're able to invest as the largest supplier in the market, which is a great position to be in. But we haven't -- the way our footprint is set up for a manufacturing point of view, we haven't seen anything that impairs us ability to serve the entire market. And as far as partnership with hyperscalers, like, look, we stay very close to the hyperscalers. Obviously, they're big customers of ours. We're big suppliers of theirs on both sides of the business. So we're very, very close to them and staying close to what are different use cases, how do they want the products built especially in the enterprise SSD market, every -- there's not just one enterprise SSD. Everybody uses slightly different interfaces and there's different ways, their architecture of their data centers are built. So we stay close to them to make sure we build the right product for what we're -- what the markets we want to serve. All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate all of the questions, and we look forward to talking to everybody throughout the quarter. Thanks again."

            "content": "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, Western Digital return to profitability and free cash flow generation and delivered great results in the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, up 40% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 45% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, up 45% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The growth was primarily attributed to higher nearline shipments and improved nearline per unit pricing with Flash revenue up both sequentially and year-over-year. Nearline bit shipments of 108 exabytes were up 60% sequentially. Client represented 34% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase in Flash ASP more than offset a decline in Flash bit shipments, while HDD revenue decreased. Year-over-year, the increase was driven by growth in both Flash and HDD ASPs and Flash bit shipments. Consumer represented 21% of total revenue at $0.7 billion, down 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, both Flash and HDD were down at approximately similar rates and in line with seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by growth in flash bit shipments and ASP. Turning now to revenue by business segment for the fiscal third quarter. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, up 2% sequentially as ASP increased 18% on both blended and like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 15% from last quarter as we proactively focused our flash bit placement to maximize profitability. Flash revenue grew 30% from fiscal third quarter of 2023 on higher bits and ASP. HDD revenue was $1.8 billion, up 28% from last quarter, as exabyte shipments increased 41% and average price per unit increased 19% to $145. Compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 17%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 25% and 33%, respectively. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 29.3%, well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved 13.8 percentage points sequentially and 18.7 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing, our continued focus on cost reduction, and lower underutilization charges. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 27.4%, up 19.5 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 points year-over-year. There were no underutilization charges in the quarter. HDD gross margin was 31.1%, up 6.3 percentage points sequentially and 6.8 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $17 million or 1 percentage point headwind. HDD gross margin is within our long-term target range, including underutilization charges. This underscores the team's focus on cost reduction and profitability as previously, this level of gross margin was achieved with higher revenue. Operating expenses were $632 million for the quarter, up 13% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential increase was mainly driven by higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected financial results. Operating income was $380 million, which included HDD underutilization charges of 17 million. Tax expenses in the quarter was $51 million, reflecting the improved financial outlook for the fiscal year. Fiscal third quarter earnings per share was $0.63. Operating cash flow was $58 million, and free cash flow was 91 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash inflow of $33 million. Third quarter inventory was flat from the prior quarter at 3.2 billion, with days of inventory increasing 4 days to 119 days. A decline in HDD inventory offset an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.8 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, and total liquidity was $4.1 billion, including revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion and project sequential revenue growth in both HDD and Flash. In HDD, we expect continued momentum with our industry-leading SMR product portfolio aimed at the cloud. In flash, we anticipate bits will be flat and ASP is up as we continue optimizing our bit placement to maximize profitability. Gross margin is expected to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $670 million and $690 million with the increase mainly related to certain project-driven investments, coupled with higher variable compensation as the financial outlook has continued to strengthen. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal fourth quarter and $130 million to $140 million for fiscal year 2024 as the financial outlook improved. We expect earnings per share to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 342 million shares outstanding. The financial outlook has strengthened, and we will remain disciplined in executing the business, controlling our capital spending and improving our profitability. I will now turn the call back over to David. Hey Joe, thanks for the question. Look, our guide comprehends a balanced view of what we have in terms of information today with the outlook; yes, we see improvement in margins in both of the businesses. So on the flash side, we still anticipate improvement in pricing that will help gross margin move a bit higher from here. And on the HDD side, as David mentioned, we continue to focus on the obviously, the great technology that we deliver, but also the cost discipline and pricing of the products. So, all of these are comprehended in our guide. Yes, maybe I'll take that, Harlan. Yes. On the cost down, we're still anticipating the mid-teens percentage year-on-year cost downs. So there's no change there. Thank you. Yes. Sure, Tom. So let me first start by saying that the way we think of OpEx is we don't see OpEx increasing faster than revenue. So we're still very focused on that cost discipline and OpEx discipline. When it comes to this quarter, we're expecting some increase. The increase is almost 50-50 driven by variable comp as the financial outlook has improved much faster than anticipated. So there's a bit of increase there. But also, as you mentioned, there's some project-specific R&D investments that also -- that we have sort of a direct correlation and line of sight to revenue. I would say for the next couple of quarters, the range that we've guided for Q4 is a reasonable range. I know it's too early to talk about fiscal year '25. But for modelling purposes, we can use the same type of numbers for now. So for this most recent -- for Q3, we had a little bit -- and we disclosed, we talked about those. But as you can see, the numbers are becoming less and less significant. And so for the June quarter, there's still a little bit, but it's not really very significant for us to talk about on this call. Thanks, Tom. So that's a very complicated question. I mean we can go into it in detail offline. We obviously do tons of work, and I appreciate your question that it's a multifaceted issue. It's die size, it's memory hole density, it's all kinds of very complicated thing goes into producing a NAND product. Look, we think the product compares extremely favorable. We think it leads the market. Again, for the last -- looking back many years, we have been able to produce bits at one third less CapEx than the industry average, and we expect BiCS 8 to continue that leadership in the market. So we feel very, very good about the product, about its performance. Again, when you build, this is like kind of one of the magic of wafer bonding. You can build the CMOS separately from the NAND stack and then the CMOS is kind of pristine. So the interfaces are really, really fast. So there's lots of good things about that architecture that leads to a really, really market-leading product, and we feel good about it. And we've got that all ready to go when the market the market conditions will support that level of investment. Yes. Then let me first start with -- I'll take a stab at the answer, Mehdi. So look, our target model hasn't changed. We're still targeting through cycle for the flush business to be 35%, gross margin to be between 35% to 37%. And so that means, obviously, as -- from where we are today, we still have some ways to go to get to that through cycle margin. And the way we achieve these gross margins is what we've been talking about on this call. We focus on the product portfolio, the bit placement as well as on the cost side, which we still anticipate a similar type of ranges in terms of cost downs. Yes, let me take that. So on the cash flow, yes, thanks. Obviously, we returned to free cash flow positive in Q3. And as the revenue and the business continues to recover, we're completely focused on profitability and cash flow generation. So we should expect that to improve from here."

We will open the lines up for questions shortly. [Operator Instructions] Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, VP of FP&A and IR. You may begin.\nPeter Andrew: Well, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations. And as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, business plans and performance, market trends and dynamics, and financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the investor relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 results. Western Digital second quarter results demonstrate that the structural changes we have put in place over the last few years and the strategy we have been executing are producing significant outperformance across our Flash and HDD businesses. I am confident that building leading products across a broad range of end markets, closely controlling our product cost through focused R&D and manufacturing, and bolstering the agility of our business will allow us to improve through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As a result, we reported revenue of $3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 15.5%, and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.69, all of which met or exceeded the non-GAAP guidance ranges we provided in October. Before discussing the business details, I want to provide some comments on the emerging trends we are seeing and how the changes we have made position our Flash and HDD businesses to benefit. In Flash, we've been able to navigate business cycles by managing inventory proactively, offering a broad range of products, and optimizing capital efficiency through our joint venture partnership with Kioxia. These successful efforts are reflected in our best-in-class gross margin throughout the cycle. During the quarter, our portfolio strategy to dynamically allocate bit shipments drove upside in ASPs and gross margin. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to our supply and capital investments. Consequently, we continue to proactively manage our bit shipments to structurally align our supply and inventory with customer demand and improve through-cycle profitability into the future. In addition to the recovery in both Flash and HDD markets, we believe storage is entering a multi-year growth period. Generative AI has quickly emerged as yet another growth driver and transformative technology that is reshaping all industries, all companies, and our daily lives. Importantly, industry analysts estimate that the edge now represents approximately 80% of total NAND bit shipments, an increase from approximately 75% in calendar year 2022, which is another indication that cloud demand was significantly pulled in during the pandemic. In addition, we believe the second wave of generative AI-driven storage deployments will spark a client and consumer device refresh cycle and reaccelerate content growth in PC, smartphone, gaming, and consumer in the coming years. Our Flash portfolio is extremely well positioned to benefit from this emerging secular tailwind. In HDD, Western Digital's leading EPMR platform and enhanced UltraSMR technology allow us to provide the highest capacity drives for mass market deployment. We believe this innovative technology and portfolio strategy enable us to offer the best TCO to our cloud customers and outperform our peers throughout the cycle. We are confident that the multi-quarter near-line demand headwinds have subsided as our major cloud customers have reengaged with us. We anticipate our financial outperformance resulting from profitable share gains to become more evident as nearline demand accelerates into the second half of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Moving on to end market commentary. During the quarter, revenue in the cloud end market returned to sequential growth for the first time in six quarters. The sequential revenue growth was led by an increase in nearline shipments. In client, sequentially, revenue declined slightly as the increase in Flash ASPs was offset by a decline in bit shipments as we proactively optimized product mix. In consumer, the sequential revenue growth was led by seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments into retail and an increase in Flash ASPs. I'll now turn to business updates starting with Flash. During the quarter, the sequential revenue increase was due to stronger execution and driving price inflection by optimizing bit shipment across our broad go to market channels into the consumer and client end markets, resulting in stronger than planned ASP increase. In particular, our WD Black gaming SSD product, which offers high reliability, best-in-class performance, expansive storage capabilities, and a hyper realistic gaming experience, achieved a new record revenue with bit shipment growth of over 50% year-over-year. On the technology front we remain on track to ramp an array of QLC-based client SSDs utilizing BiCS6 technology. Our ability to combine this new high-performance node with our in-house controller development allows us to offer a portfolio of client SSDs with unmatched performance and value. We expect these products to lead the transition to QLC Flash in calendar year 2024. Additionally, BiCS8 yield is progressing well and we remain on track to productize this technology. Turning to HDD, the sequential revenue increase was driven by improving nearline demand and pricing. Moreover, we are encouraged by demand in China with revenue doubling on a sequential and year-over-year basis, both of which were ahead of our expectations. We anticipate year-over-year growth in HDD throughout this calendar year. In both the first and second quarters, we shipped approximately 1 million UltraSMR drives per quarter. We forecast UltraSMR hard drive shipments to increase significantly in the fiscal third quarter and SMR drive shipments to continue to outgrow that of CMR drives going forward. Importantly, the adoption of UltraSMR is broadening to our major customers worldwide, including a third cloud titan in the US this year, as well as hyperscale and smart video customers in China. We expect to complete the qualifications of our 26 terabyte and 28 terabyte UltraSMR drives at these customers this quarter and throughout the calendar year and forecast SMR to comprise the majority of nearline demand by calendar year 2025. We have strong conviction that our portfolio strategy of first commercializing Western Digital's industry-leading UltraSMR technology, which will be followed by our transition from EPMR to Hammer offers the best TCO to our customers in both the near and long term, while delivering leading portfolio profitability in the industry. Over the next several years we will be introducing a number of exciting products, including multiple generations of nearline drives combining EPMR, OptiNAND, and UltraSMR technologies in the 30 to upper 30 terabyte capacity range, all of which will be ready for high volume production to support the explosion of AI training data and content. Before I turn over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. In Flash, starting with demand in calendar year 2024, we estimate industry bit growth to be around the mid-teens percentage, similar to the growth rate in calendar year 2023. On the supply side, we estimate that fab-out bit production growth to remain in the mid-single digit percentage range. We believe our business agility and our highly capital efficient and low cost BiCS architecture have enabled us to align supply with demand via nodal transition much more quickly than our peers. We will continue our disciplined approach to dynamically managing our inventory capacities and capital expenditures to keep our supply aligned with end customer demand. Although Flash pricing has started to increase, our profitability and cash generation continue to be well below the level that justify an increase in capital investments. We anticipate wafer equipment spending will remain at historic lows in the near term and Flash to be undersupplied for an extended period of time. Overall, we will continue to focus on allocating our bids to the most attractive end markets and anticipate Flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver throughout this calendar year. In HDD, our competitive portfolio strategy has enabled us to consistently achieve profitable share gain in the last two calendar years. We are confident that this trend will continue as nearline demand continues to improve and we continue to ramp our UltraSMR enabled products. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial second quarter results.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, the success of the strategy we have been executing is reflected in our financial performance. Non-GAAP results in the fiscal second quarter exceeded or were at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Total revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, up 10% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.69, as strong execution with our broad go-to-market channels benefited Flash ASP and gross margin. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 23% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth is attributed to higher nearline shipments to that of center customers and better nearline pricing. Nearline bit shipments were 67 exabytes, up 23%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower eSSD bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, HDD cloud revenue increased for the first time in six quarters. Client represented 37% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 2% sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, an increase in Flash ASP was more than offset by a decline in flash bit shipments. The year-over-year increase was due to higher flash shipments, primarily driven by client SSD shipments into PC applications, more than offsetting a decline in ASP. Consumer represented 28% of total revenue at $0.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth was primarily due to seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in Flash bit shipments was partially offset by a decline in Flash ASP, as well as lower HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by business segment. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, growing 7% sequentially, as Flash ASPs increased 10% on a blended basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis, stronger than anticipated entering the quarter. Bid shipments decreased 2% after record shipments in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Flash revenue grew slightly with a 21% increase in bit shipments, offsetting lower prices. HDD revenue was $1.4 billion, increasing 14% sequentially. As total exabyte shipments increased 14%, an average price per unit increased 9% to $122. On a year-over-year basis, HDD revenue declined 6%, while total exabyte shipments increased 2% and average price per unit increased 23%. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 15.5% above the guidance range provided in October and improving 11.4 percentage points sequentially, while declining 1.9 percentage points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher Flash ASPs as we proactively optimized product mix, which more than offset higher than anticipated underutilization charges of $156 million or a 5.1 percentage points headwind. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 7.9%, up 18.2 percentage points sequentially, and down 6.6 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $107 million or a 6.4 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 24.8%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and 4.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $49 million or a 3.6 percentage point headwind. We continue to tightly manage operating expenses, which were $561 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year, and at the lower end of the guidance range. Operating loss in the quarter was $91 million, which included underutilization charges of $156 million. Fiscal second quarter loss per share was $0.69, inclusive of a $14 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred shares. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $92 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $176 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. The quarter ending inventory was $3.2 billion, declining $281 million from the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased five days to 115 days. The majority of the decline was in Flash, where Flash days of inventory remained at a four-year low. During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in convertible notes, repurchased $508 million of the outstanding 2024 convertible notes and paid down $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. Gross debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. We expect to retire the remaining balance of approximately $600 million of the 2024 convertible notes at maturity in February 2024. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion and total liquidity was $4.7 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. For the fiscal third quarter, our non GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to of $3.4 billion; we expect sequential revenue growth to be mainly driven by an increase in HDD; we anticipate Flash revenue to be up slightly as we remain focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP; we expect gross margin to be between 22% and 24%, which includes HDD underutilization charges of $30 million to $40 million; we expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million with the increase driven by the reinstatement of certain incentive compensation programs as the financial outlook has strengthened. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $95 million. We continue to expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal third quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect earnings per share to be $0.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 330 million shares outstanding. As the financial outlook has improved, we will remain disciplined in executing the business, proactively managing our supply and inventory to meet customer end demand and controlling capital spending, all with the goal of improving profitability. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. I want to emphasize that the steps the Western Digital team has taken to instill and deploy an industry leading product portfolio, while also moving quickly to adapt to both volatile market dynamics and anticipate future trends have enabled us to capitalize on the upswing we see ahead. Through our product leadership and ability to dampen business cycles and improve through-cycle profitability, I am confident we are well positioned to execute on our current strategy, which will reaffirm our strength over the long term. Let's now begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the gross margin improvement in Q1. I guess, how would -- how do you portion that between the drive business and the NAND business? And I guess, I would think with being judicious on volume, you get some pretty good NAND pricing. I guess, I might have expected a little bit more gross margin improvement. So just curious what I'm missing there? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah, Joe. So we've been it's good to see the pricing inflect. If you look into Q1, we were happy with the gross margin we delivered in the Flash business in the December quarter at 7.9%. I think we were able to capture the turn in the market well. So it gives us a little higher base going into the March quarter. But if you look at both businesses, you see Flash will be down on bits and up on price. So we see -- we still see strong price increases quarter-to-quarter, but we're down on volume. Let's call it, low double digits. And then in the HDD business, we see increase in volume and increase in price.\nJoe Moore: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just kind of building off that last question, I know you talked about hard disk drive underutilization, expectation in this current quarter kind of embedded in that 22% to 24% guide. What's the underutilization assumption you're making on the Flash business? And just in general, how do you think about the trajectory of Flash gross margin? Let's say, in theory of pricing and your implementation of price increases continues, how do we think about the return to kind of a 30% plus gross margin in Flash? So just trying to think about the puts and takes in the guidance and then the longer term kind of view at what you characterize as normalized gross margin?\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey, thanks, Aaron. So for Flash, in our guide, we don't have underutilization for Q3. In fact, we executed ahead of schedule and reached our targeted supply and inventory goals faster than what we anticipated. And so, as you know, we continue to dynamically manage supply and inventory to meet our end demand and so the fab utilization reflects that. If you recall, in our results in Q1, Flash inventory was down almost $400 million, last quarter we saw another over $200 million dollar decline in inventory. We exited the quarter at levels that we haven\u2019t see in few years. So having said that, obviously, we will continue to be disciplined in how we manage our supply and inventory to meet end customer demand on Flash and also, of course, control our capital spend. With respect to your question at the 30%, let me clarify. Was your question 30% on the Flash or on the HDD side?\nAaron Rakers: Well, I guess, I'm going to say both, but [Multiple Speakers]\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I thought I heard you say Flash. I was going to start talking about it. Well, let me start talking about HDD. Look, at HDD, we're pretty much very close to that level. When you look at what we delivered in the second quarter and when you also look at the guide, it does reflect the continuous margin improvement on the HDD side. And so, I also anticipate that there should be continuous improvement as the recovery continues in that business. So 30% is very much within reach. And we should be able to achieve it pretty soon. On the flash side, the --lot has to do with continuing to optimize the product mix to drive that ASP up. And also, of course, continuing to deliver on our cost reduction. And so, on the cost reduction, we've done well so far. We've been in the mid-teens. I expect us to also hit that mid-teens percentage cost reduction for this fiscal year. So, as the pricing continues to improve, I\u2019d anticipate that we would be -- we would also be there -- let\u2019s say in the next few quarters.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\nCJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping to focus on the NAND bit side of the house. You're talking about optimizing product mix, but here we have bits down in December. It looks like they're down -- implied down again in the March quarter. So can you speak to, I guess, your plans there? When do you think that will open up? And can you be a little more specific in terms of which end markets you're focused on and how we should think about when they come to market and the timing and implications to pricing?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah. So I'll start and Wissam can add some too. So yes, we had bits down, we had a record quarter last -- two quarters ago and then we were down a little bit this past quarter, then we'll be down more. I mean, it\u2019s just a reflection of the flow through the underutilization that we were doing to kind of keep supply and demand matched. We've talked about this a lot and not let our inventory get out of control. I think we've been very good about keeping our inventory -- we're at a four-year low on inventory, so on the NAND side. So, look, CJ, we're just going to keep very focused on what demand is, where we're at in inventory, and adjust the utilization of the fab to make sure those stay aligned as we go forward. So I think as we said in the script, you kind of assume that throughout this calendar year, you're going to see most of the growth in Flash be from pricing.\nCJ Muse: [Multiple Speakers] Go ahead, please.\nWissam Jabre: Now, I was going to move on to the second part of your question.\nCJ Muse: Yeah, please go ahead.\nWissam Jabre: Okay. So mix is like -- mix is just a very dynamic process, literally day-by-day, week-by-week in the business. We have a big consumer franchise, we sell all over the world, we have hundreds of thousands of points of presence and retail platforms. We have a big channel business where pricing can get adjusted weekly, then all the way up to, obviously, the quarterly negotiated markets. So we're just always dynamically understanding where pricing is going to be. And then again, in each of those segments, we have different products. We have client SSDs that are WD Black all the way down to WD Green. So in different segments of the market, all with different price points, all with different margins, all with different demand profiles. And it's a constant process of just making sure we put the supply where we're going to get the best return. This last quarter we talked about, we mixed a little bit out of client and into consumer, as you would expect in a strong consumer quarter. And we'll continue to do that. The place where we're still waiting for it to come back is enterprise SSD, that\u2019s still been pretty depressed and as that market starts to come back, we expect to mix into that as well.\nCJ Muse: Very helpful. If I could ask just a quick follow-up. Wissam, can you shed some light on how to think about OpEx into June quarter and beyond? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, of course, CJ. So on the OpEx side, for the June quarter I expect us to be more or less in line. Beyond that, as the business profitability continues to improve, I expect a gradual increase. But we're laser focused on profitability and so I don't anticipate to increase our OpEx faster than revenue growth, of course. And when you look at look at where we've come from and where we are today. We're still at or maybe more than 20% lower than where we were at the beginning of the cyclical downturn.\nCJ Muse: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, CJ.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. I have two if I may. The first, why do you think there was a doubling of China demand for [indiscernible] applications this quarter? And how sustainable do you think that is? I ask, because the Chinese economy hasn't been robust for some time, so any thoughts on that would be helpful.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I wouldn't attribute it to the smart video market. It's more of the China hyper scalers coming back and better demand there.\nKarl Ackerman: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. I guess, [indiscernible] if I may. It's nice to see an improving outlook for March. Showing one quarter ahead of many of our expectations. However, I'm a bit surprised to see your NAND ASP trajectory in December below that of peers. So is there any reason why your NAND prices or ASPs perhaps would fall behind peers from here? And/or maybe there would be a catch-up opportunity as well. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes. Price, your price deltas, obviously, have a big dependency on your starting point and we were starting from a better gross margin position than anybody else in the industry by quite a bit. And then on top of that, you have mix based on what's happening in the quarter and kind of where the product is going. I think if you look at profitability of the franchise, it's still leading the industry.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Karl.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is now opened.\nTom O'Malley: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. It's Tom O'Malley here at Barclays. I wanted to ask you [Multiple Speakers] So I wanted to ask on the competitive environment. Your competitor obviously talked about a million unit shipments of Hammer in the first half of the calendar year here. I just wanted to get your comments on, are you seeing any change in your interactions with your customers? Are they pointing to Hammer as a solution that they're going to move too early in the year? Can you just talk to just the broader ecosystem and if you are seeing a transition or if it's the other side really, clearly you are seeing some better trends with your UltraSMR drives. Just any color on that transition with your customers would be helpful.\nDavid Goeckeler: I think customers just want to understand everybody's roadmap, right? And they're not looking for a particular solution. I mean, for example, we've been shipping EPMR drives for years versus PMR drives and nobody really asked us for EPMR drive. So they just want the capacity point at a TCO at a reliability level and be able to satisfy their demand. And I think that's the way we've optimized our portfolio. We've commercialized EPMR, we're very happy with the technology. We have UltraSMR on top of that. That allows us to deliver both highest capacity point in the industry, the best TCO position at very, very large scale. We can produce millions and millions of those drives per quarter. So that's what customers are looking for and they're looking to understand on your road map that you can continue to drive that TCO equation forward, because they're obviously betting extremely large data centers on our ability to do that. And our customers, I can tell you, our customers have an enormous amount of confidence in our roadmap, in our current products, and you're seeing that in the performance of the business. You're seeing accelerating growth, you're seeing better profitability, you're seeing share gains. That's a clear indication that customers are very happy with our products. Now in particular on the transition of EPMR to Hammer, I know this has gotten a lot of attention. For our portfolio, given our UltraSMR technology, it's been adopted by the market, Hammer does not make sense until we get to 4 terabytes per platter. Because Hammer adds a lot of costs to the product, so it adds a lot of costs to your bill of material. So we can deliver -- we see the next couple of generations or couple of years of ability to deliver a very strong TCO proposition at scale on the EPMR plus UltraSMR platforms that customers have clearly adopted. We see it as the majority of our demand in calendar year 2025. We will transition to Hammer when we get to that 4 terabytes per platter. That's the economic crossover, right, that we're looking for from a portfolio management point of view. So that gives you a little more color on how we're thinking about the technology, the transition, and how customers are thinking about it. I think it's very clear, customers are very happy with our road map and they understand in great detail where we're going.\nTom O'Malley: Perfect. And then just one quick one on HDD gross margins. I think, when you look at the underutilization charges that are still present, you can look at just taking that out and what that means to the gross margins over the next couple of quarters. But is there any way to frame like a revenue level that gets you back to that 30% gross margin target for the HDD business or is it kind of just a wait and see when utilization takes back up and it will get there eventually. Any way to frame that from a modeling perspective as to when that can get back to your range? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: So, Tom, if you look at our numbers and you adjust for the underutilization charges, we\u2019re almost there. So, what I would say, instead of giving a number or movement, let's say, in quantifying it. What I would say is, I expect us to be at the 30% level, at a lower level than then our normal run rate that we've had in any priors through-cycle periods. We've taken quite a bit of cost out of our -- cost structure as you very well know. And so, that will help us get there at a faster phase. With respect to underutilization, I do anticipate to probably have a bit more in other quarter of underutilization beyond this one and then we'll see where we are in the June quarter. We can talk about it then.\nTom O'Malley: Thank you very much.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Tom.\nWissam Jabre: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nKrish Sankar: [indiscernible] the first one on NAND. Either Dave or Wissam, how do you think of the sustainability of NAND pricing into the back half, given that there's a view that first half pricing could be up. In a calendar year base, calendar first half we have over 50%. How do you think about the sustainability and what would be the trigger point for you to start adding capacity in that? And then just as a follow-up on the hard drive side, you kind of mentioned Hammer adds cost, which kind of makes a lot of sense, given the laser and NFT. Kind of curious, if you -- whenever you start doing it would you do it with 10 discs? And if the market wants a Hammer solution from WD, how soon can you get it?\nDavid Goeckeler: Okay, there's a lot in there. So on NAND, we obviously look at a lot of things in NAND, there's a lot of stuff that goes into supply of NAND, from utilization rates, to nodal transitions, to CapEx investment, and it's a complicated equation. But our current view is, we see NAND under supplied for quite some time in the market and that's appropriate given where we are in the profitability of the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, we're happy to see the inflection in pricing and the performance of the business and it's ahead of where we thought it was going to be, but we've got a long way to go before we're going to get to the profitability levels where investments are going to come back. I think the answer to your question, we need very clear visibility into through-cycle profitability numbers that match our model. And we're coming out of a deep hole and that would imply that you need to be above your through-cycle level for a while to get to that level over time. So that's what we're looking at, and we expect pricing to -- pricing is notoriously difficult to predict and we're very careful that we don't forecast it, but clearly, we're predicting good pricing increases into the next quarter and we will stay very disciplined of managing supply and demand in our business. We talked about that, bits are down sequentially. On HDD, I'm sorry, could you just repeat the HDD question again so that I make sure I got it?\nKrish Sankar: Yeah, sure, Dave. I was just trying to figure out on the HDD side. A, number one, in Hammer would you be doing it with 10 disks? Second one is, if the market wants a solution from Western Digital a Hammer solution, how soon can you get it out.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, so let me -- we'll defer the details of product launch on Hammer and how many discs it's going to have until we get closer to that process. I mean, it's a project that's -- we're happy with where the progress of it is, given what I said earlier. We've got -- we've built a technology roadmap that allows us to get to 40 terabytes on very well proven cost controlled, high manufacturing ability technology and we're looking forward to delivering that to the market over the next couple of years. The reality is, there's no customer like demands a particular technology. The customer wants a capacity point at a certain TCO, at a certain level of reliability, and a certain level of performance. And our technology roadmap is built to deliver that. What's inside the box is less important. The real thing is, you have to deliver all of those that we just said and you have to be able to manufacture it at a level of millions and millions of units per quarter to satisfy the market. That's what our customers are looking for. Our EPMR and UltraSMR technology, that's exactly what it delivers. The ability to deliver increasing TCO, which -- if we can deliver increasing TCO, we can continue to drive pricing higher. We can produce it at very high scale, it can be qualified very, very quickly and it's very highly reliable and high quality product. And our customers are increasingly adopting that technology as you see from our forecast.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, David. Very helpful.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks. The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Thank you so much. Dave, I appreciate the answer you just gave around pricing, but if I could ask this in a slightly different way. How would you think about pricing, the runway that you have in Flash relative to past cycles? I mean, given that your commentary on how you managed your inventory, given your comments on expectation to be undersupplied for a long time, would you venture to say that the pricing runway that you have should be longer than what you had in past cycles? A - David Goeckeler On NAND. I'm sorry. Look, I mean, I think it's the cycle we just -- I guess we're not out of it. We're coming out of it. Like I said, like we're just taking the first steps out of a cycle we haven't seen before, I think in the 3D era. So, what we're doing, Wamsi, is just making sure we get our supply and demand matched and make sure we keep our inventory controlled and deliver the best profitability, given the portfolio we have and continue to optimize the portfolio that we can have the best mix and therefore the best profitability. It's very difficult to predict future pricing and -- but our general point is that, although things are going in the right direction, we're not close to a point where the CapEx investment is going to come back and I think that's the real number on what future supply is going to be. I mean clearly there's some utilization that is going to come back, but it's going to be needed, quite frankly. And we're going to wait to see on -- as I said through-cycle profitability where we have visibility to that, to reinvest more in this business.\nKrish Sankar: Okay thanks. If I could, you mentioned about entering a multi-year growth period with Generative AI and especially at the edge, the demand for NAND bits. When do you thing that the industry will start to see this demand NAND bits at the edge start to reflect higher?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, look, I think we're going to see it as we start to go into PC refresh cycles. We admitted that, we're still very early in this, right? Getting the cloud -- I mean the big part right now is getting the cloud capable of delivering GenAI to all of us, and then drive that architecture, down to the edge. I think we're starting to see in some of the markets some of the future specs of products where they're increasing the amount of NAND, so we're optimistic about that. As we go through the next couple of years when this architecture gets deployed and adopted. So I can't like put it down to a particular quarter for you, but certainly as new technology launches or new technology adoption, it's moving at a faster pace than any technology I\u2019ve seen in the very long time.\nKrish Sankar: [indiscernible]\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wamsi.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now opened.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to make clarification. David, did you say that demand is tracking to mid-teens and that compares to bid supply growth of 5%?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we see demand around mid-teens and that's fab out. What we see is kind of fab production of mid-single digits. And obviously, there's inventory between those.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Now what got me confusing is, you also said your NAND inventory is a multi-year low, did I misunderstand you?\nDavid Goeckeler: You did not misunderstand me.\nMehdi Hosseini: So if your inventory is at multi-year low and demand [indiscernible] have all exceeding supply so you basically are not going to ship to supply, or you are not going to ship to demand throughout the year.\nDavid Goeckeler: We'll ship to our share demand throughout the year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Would that impact your marker share or you are focusing on [indiscernible] more profitable than market?\nWissam Jabre: No, we don\u2019t anticipant that to impact our market share. The stats that you mentioned on the supply and production were for our estimates and what we see from third party estimates on the overall market.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. That\u2019s overall market, not reflection of [Multiple Speakers]\nDavid Goeckeler: Go ahead, Mehdi. I\u2019m sorry. No, please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: So these are market trends, not so specific to Western Digital. And then, if I may just have a quick follow up. In terms of the NAND cost down, should we assume that long-term trend of down 10% in terms of CAGR, cost per\u2026\nWissam Jabre: No, we're comfortable with the 15% cost downs. We believe that if you -- I mean, we're ahead of that right now in FY 2024, quite frankly, but it'll come back and I think when you look at the full year, you can still model 15% for the fiscal year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering on enterprise SSDs, you mentioned that they're still depressed and you'll mix into it. But given the supply situation that you just talked about and where we are in the cycle. Like, what is your -- how do you envision coming back in that market? And like, can you just remind us what a normal mix of enterprise SSDs looks like in your Flash business? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean, for us it was a -- it's an emerging -- it's an emerging part of the portfolio. I think, right -- going right into the downturn, we got qualified at numerous or a number of cloud titans in our NVMe based enterprise SSD, and then we kind of went into a market where, quite frankly, enterprise SSD has been the most depressed part of the NAND market in the downturn and we haven't seen that come back yet. So, as that starts to come back out of digestion, it'll just be another opportunity for us to mix into that. How much we mix into it will be depending on what the price is on that -- in that segment versus other options we have for those bits. So we don't necessarily -- we don't necessarily have a fixed percentage we're going for, it's just -- we have the product, it's qualified, as demand comes back, we'll consider that demand and part of the whole portfolio calculus.\nSteven Fox: Would the big picture be that it trails enterprise HDDs by a certain amount of time in general? Like, do you have a vision for just -- as enterprise spending recovers, where that product cycle would be?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, certainly, it is trailing enterprise HDD. I mean, enterprise -- I don't know if I could make a generalization about that, because it's just one cycle here, but clearly there's more inventory digestion in the hyperscale market on enterprise SSD than there was in capacity enterprise HDDs. As we talked about, we see continued growth in capacity enterprise HDDs, we started out this fiscal year projecting sequential growth throughout the fiscal year and now we're talking about sequential growth throughout the calendar year. So we see good demand trends coming back on capacity enterprise HDD, which again is a good sign for enterprise SSDs will come back, because there's a little -- there's more inventory digestion to get through.\nSteven Fox: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now live.\nMark Miller: Your cash flow significantly improved during the quarter, but still there was an outflow. When do you expect to be positive from a free cash flow perspective?\nWissam Jabre: Yeah, Mark. So turning free cash flow positive is a top priority for us. We are very much focussed on it and we have line of site to achieving it. We expect to achieve free cash flow positive in the second half of the fiscal 2023, either this quarter on the next. As you know, we typically don\u2019t guide for cash flow.\nMark Miller: Do you expect to -- will you have to draw on your revolver or do you expect we won\u2019t have to draw on it?\nDavid Goeckeler: I don't see that at this point.\nMark Miller: Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Thanks, Mark.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Yeah, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, David. Thanks a lot. Just wondering do you guys have an early opinion on if NAND bit rate increases, as GenAI sort of impact, not just edge cycles, but sort of corporate cycles, Fortune 1000 and hyper scaler storage as well. And all the other sort of end market constituencies, do you have any opinion on if there's a sort of increase to NAND supply overtime? And if you do, do you think the increase could be material and noticeable? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: It's a good point here, which is, like -- my comments earlier were about the cycle and what we see in NAND and investing in. And we're big believers in the NAND market and there's going to be a lot of bit growth in the future. And also the great thing about the NAND market is, you still have the ability to produce new nodes and more efficient as far as how much capital you need to put in to get that growth. So, look, the overall thesis on NAND continuing to grow, we have a long technology roadmap where we can continue to deliver cost downs, that's still a great story and we expect -- to your point, we expect generative AI to be additive to that, especially on the edge. The NAND market has really rotated -- through this downturn really rotated to an edge centric market. Which, again, our portfolio is very, very well positioned with our consumer business, with our client SSD business, with our gaming business, with our position with PC OEMs. So, we're very well positioned there. And yes, as we see that demand come back, and it resets the economics of the industry, we have the ability to go satisfy that demand. And so, I think you are very bullish about that.\nAnanda Baruah: That\u2019s a useful context. Thanks a lot.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you. All right, thanks everyone. I appreciate your time today. We will see you throughout the quarter. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 results. Western Digital second quarter results demonstrate that the structural changes we have put in place over the last few years and the strategy we have been executing are producing significant outperformance across our Flash and HDD businesses. I am confident that building leading products across a broad range of end markets, closely controlling our product cost through focused R&D and manufacturing, and bolstering the agility of our business will allow us to improve through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As a result, we reported revenue of $3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 15.5%, and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.69, all of which met or exceeded the non-GAAP guidance ranges we provided in October. Before discussing the business details, I want to provide some comments on the emerging trends we are seeing and how the changes we have made position our Flash and HDD businesses to benefit. In Flash, we've been able to navigate business cycles by managing inventory proactively, offering a broad range of products, and optimizing capital efficiency through our joint venture partnership with Kioxia. These successful efforts are reflected in our best-in-class gross margin throughout the cycle. During the quarter, our portfolio strategy to dynamically allocate bit shipments drove upside in ASPs and gross margin. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to our supply and capital investments. Consequently, we continue to proactively manage our bit shipments to structurally align our supply and inventory with customer demand and improve through-cycle profitability into the future. In addition to the recovery in both Flash and HDD markets, we believe storage is entering a multi-year growth period. Generative AI has quickly emerged as yet another growth driver and transformative technology that is reshaping all industries, all companies, and our daily lives. Importantly, industry analysts estimate that the edge now represents approximately 80% of total NAND bit shipments, an increase from approximately 75% in calendar year 2022, which is another indication that cloud demand was significantly pulled in during the pandemic. In addition, we believe the second wave of generative AI-driven storage deployments will spark a client and consumer device refresh cycle and reaccelerate content growth in PC, smartphone, gaming, and consumer in the coming years. Our Flash portfolio is extremely well positioned to benefit from this emerging secular tailwind. In HDD, Western Digital's leading EPMR platform and enhanced UltraSMR technology allow us to provide the highest capacity drives for mass market deployment. We believe this innovative technology and portfolio strategy enable us to offer the best TCO to our cloud customers and outperform our peers throughout the cycle. We are confident that the multi-quarter near-line demand headwinds have subsided as our major cloud customers have reengaged with us. We anticipate our financial outperformance resulting from profitable share gains to become more evident as nearline demand accelerates into the second half of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Moving on to end market commentary. During the quarter, revenue in the cloud end market returned to sequential growth for the first time in six quarters. The sequential revenue growth was led by an increase in nearline shipments. In client, sequentially, revenue declined slightly as the increase in Flash ASPs was offset by a decline in bit shipments as we proactively optimized product mix. In consumer, the sequential revenue growth was led by seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments into retail and an increase in Flash ASPs. I'll now turn to business updates starting with Flash. During the quarter, the sequential revenue increase was due to stronger execution and driving price inflection by optimizing bit shipment across our broad go to market channels into the consumer and client end markets, resulting in stronger than planned ASP increase. In particular, our WD Black gaming SSD product, which offers high reliability, best-in-class performance, expansive storage capabilities, and a hyper realistic gaming experience, achieved a new record revenue with bit shipment growth of over 50% year-over-year. On the technology front we remain on track to ramp an array of QLC-based client SSDs utilizing BiCS6 technology. Our ability to combine this new high-performance node with our in-house controller development allows us to offer a portfolio of client SSDs with unmatched performance and value. We expect these products to lead the transition to QLC Flash in calendar year 2024. Additionally, BiCS8 yield is progressing well and we remain on track to productize this technology. Turning to HDD, the sequential revenue increase was driven by improving nearline demand and pricing. Moreover, we are encouraged by demand in China with revenue doubling on a sequential and year-over-year basis, both of which were ahead of our expectations. We anticipate year-over-year growth in HDD throughout this calendar year. In both the first and second quarters, we shipped approximately 1 million UltraSMR drives per quarter. We forecast UltraSMR hard drive shipments to increase significantly in the fiscal third quarter and SMR drive shipments to continue to outgrow that of CMR drives going forward. Importantly, the adoption of UltraSMR is broadening to our major customers worldwide, including a third cloud titan in the US this year, as well as hyperscale and smart video customers in China. We expect to complete the qualifications of our 26 terabyte and 28 terabyte UltraSMR drives at these customers this quarter and throughout the calendar year and forecast SMR to comprise the majority of nearline demand by calendar year 2025. We have strong conviction that our portfolio strategy of first commercializing Western Digital's industry-leading UltraSMR technology, which will be followed by our transition from EPMR to Hammer offers the best TCO to our customers in both the near and long term, while delivering leading portfolio profitability in the industry. Over the next several years we will be introducing a number of exciting products, including multiple generations of nearline drives combining EPMR, OptiNAND, and UltraSMR technologies in the 30 to upper 30 terabyte capacity range, all of which will be ready for high volume production to support the explosion of AI training data and content. Before I turn over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. In Flash, starting with demand in calendar year 2024, we estimate industry bit growth to be around the mid-teens percentage, similar to the growth rate in calendar year 2023. On the supply side, we estimate that fab-out bit production growth to remain in the mid-single digit percentage range. We believe our business agility and our highly capital efficient and low cost BiCS architecture have enabled us to align supply with demand via nodal transition much more quickly than our peers. We will continue our disciplined approach to dynamically managing our inventory capacities and capital expenditures to keep our supply aligned with end customer demand. Although Flash pricing has started to increase, our profitability and cash generation continue to be well below the level that justify an increase in capital investments. We anticipate wafer equipment spending will remain at historic lows in the near term and Flash to be undersupplied for an extended period of time. Overall, we will continue to focus on allocating our bids to the most attractive end markets and anticipate Flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver throughout this calendar year. In HDD, our competitive portfolio strategy has enabled us to consistently achieve profitable share gain in the last two calendar years. We are confident that this trend will continue as nearline demand continues to improve and we continue to ramp our UltraSMR enabled products. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial second quarter results. Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. I want to emphasize that the steps the Western Digital team has taken to instill and deploy an industry leading product portfolio, while also moving quickly to adapt to both volatile market dynamics and anticipate future trends have enabled us to capitalize on the upswing we see ahead. Through our product leadership and ability to dampen business cycles and improve through-cycle profitability, I am confident we are well positioned to execute on our current strategy, which will reaffirm our strength over the long term. Let's now begin the Q&A. Yeah, Joe. So we've been it's good to see the pricing inflect. If you look into Q1, we were happy with the gross margin we delivered in the Flash business in the December quarter at 7.9%. I think we were able to capture the turn in the market well. So it gives us a little higher base going into the March quarter. But if you look at both businesses, you see Flash will be down on bits and up on price. So we see -- we still see strong price increases quarter-to-quarter, but we're down on volume. Let's call it, low double digits. And then in the HDD business, we see increase in volume and increase in price. Thanks. Hey, thanks, Aaron. So for Flash, in our guide, we don't have underutilization for Q3. In fact, we executed ahead of schedule and reached our targeted supply and inventory goals faster than what we anticipated. And so, as you know, we continue to dynamically manage supply and inventory to meet our end demand and so the fab utilization reflects that. If you recall, in our results in Q1, Flash inventory was down almost $400 million, last quarter we saw another over $200 million dollar decline in inventory. We exited the quarter at levels that we haven't see in few years. So having said that, obviously, we will continue to be disciplined in how we manage our supply and inventory to meet end customer demand on Flash and also, of course, control our capital spend. With respect to your question at the 30%, let me clarify. Was your question 30% on the Flash or on the HDD side? Yes, I thought I heard you say Flash. I was going to start talking about it. Well, let me start talking about HDD. Look, at HDD, we're pretty much very close to that level. When you look at what we delivered in the second quarter and when you also look at the guide, it does reflect the continuous margin improvement on the HDD side. And so, I also anticipate that there should be continuous improvement as the recovery continues in that business. So 30% is very much within reach. And we should be able to achieve it pretty soon. On the flash side, the --lot has to do with continuing to optimize the product mix to drive that ASP up. And also, of course, continuing to deliver on our cost reduction. And so, on the cost reduction, we've done well so far. We've been in the mid-teens. I expect us to also hit that mid-teens percentage cost reduction for this fiscal year. So, as the pricing continues to improve, I'd anticipate that we would be -- we would also be there -- let's say in the next few quarters. Yeah. So I'll start and Wissam can add some too. So yes, we had bits down, we had a record quarter last -- two quarters ago and then we were down a little bit this past quarter, then we'll be down more. I mean, it's just a reflection of the flow through the underutilization that we were doing to kind of keep supply and demand matched. We've talked about this a lot and not let our inventory get out of control. I think we've been very good about keeping our inventory -- we're at a four-year low on inventory, so on the NAND side. So, look, CJ, we're just going to keep very focused on what demand is, where we're at in inventory, and adjust the utilization of the fab to make sure those stay aligned as we go forward. So I think as we said in the script, you kind of assume that throughout this calendar year, you're going to see most of the growth in Flash be from pricing. Thanks, CJ. Yes, I wouldn't attribute it to the smart video market. It's more of the China hyper scalers coming back and better demand there. Yes. Price, your price deltas, obviously, have a big dependency on your starting point and we were starting from a better gross margin position than anybody else in the industry by quite a bit. And then on top of that, you have mix based on what's happening in the quarter and kind of where the product is going. I think if you look at profitability of the franchise, it's still leading the industry. Thank you, Karl. I think customers just want to understand everybody's roadmap, right? And they're not looking for a particular solution. I mean, for example, we've been shipping EPMR drives for years versus PMR drives and nobody really asked us for EPMR drive. So they just want the capacity point at a TCO at a reliability level and be able to satisfy their demand. And I think that's the way we've optimized our portfolio. We've commercialized EPMR, we're very happy with the technology. We have UltraSMR on top of that. That allows us to deliver both highest capacity point in the industry, the best TCO position at very, very large scale. We can produce millions and millions of those drives per quarter. So that's what customers are looking for and they're looking to understand on your road map that you can continue to drive that TCO equation forward, because they're obviously betting extremely large data centers on our ability to do that. And our customers, I can tell you, our customers have an enormous amount of confidence in our roadmap, in our current products, and you're seeing that in the performance of the business. You're seeing accelerating growth, you're seeing better profitability, you're seeing share gains. That's a clear indication that customers are very happy with our products. Now in particular on the transition of EPMR to Hammer, I know this has gotten a lot of attention. For our portfolio, given our UltraSMR technology, it's been adopted by the market, Hammer does not make sense until we get to 4 terabytes per platter. Because Hammer adds a lot of costs to the product, so it adds a lot of costs to your bill of material. So we can deliver -- we see the next couple of generations or couple of years of ability to deliver a very strong TCO proposition at scale on the EPMR plus UltraSMR platforms that customers have clearly adopted. We see it as the majority of our demand in calendar year 2025. We will transition to Hammer when we get to that 4 terabytes per platter. That's the economic crossover, right, that we're looking for from a portfolio management point of view. So that gives you a little more color on how we're thinking about the technology, the transition, and how customers are thinking about it. I think it's very clear, customers are very happy with our road map and they understand in great detail where we're going. Thanks, Tom. Okay, there's a lot in there. So on NAND, we obviously look at a lot of things in NAND, there's a lot of stuff that goes into supply of NAND, from utilization rates, to nodal transitions, to CapEx investment, and it's a complicated equation. But our current view is, we see NAND under supplied for quite some time in the market and that's appropriate given where we are in the profitability of the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, we're happy to see the inflection in pricing and the performance of the business and it's ahead of where we thought it was going to be, but we've got a long way to go before we're going to get to the profitability levels where investments are going to come back. I think the answer to your question, we need very clear visibility into through-cycle profitability numbers that match our model. And we're coming out of a deep hole and that would imply that you need to be above your through-cycle level for a while to get to that level over time. So that's what we're looking at, and we expect pricing to -- pricing is notoriously difficult to predict and we're very careful that we don't forecast it, but clearly, we're predicting good pricing increases into the next quarter and we will stay very disciplined of managing supply and demand in our business. We talked about that, bits are down sequentially. On HDD, I'm sorry, could you just repeat the HDD question again so that I make sure I got it? Yes, so let me -- we'll defer the details of product launch on Hammer and how many discs it's going to have until we get closer to that process. I mean, it's a project that's -- we're happy with where the progress of it is, given what I said earlier. We've got -- we've built a technology roadmap that allows us to get to 40 terabytes on very well proven cost controlled, high manufacturing ability technology and we're looking forward to delivering that to the market over the next couple of years. The reality is, there's no customer like demands a particular technology. The customer wants a capacity point at a certain TCO, at a certain level of reliability, and a certain level of performance. And our technology roadmap is built to deliver that. What's inside the box is less important. The real thing is, you have to deliver all of those that we just said and you have to be able to manufacture it at a level of millions and millions of units per quarter to satisfy the market. That's what our customers are looking for. Our EPMR and UltraSMR technology, that's exactly what it delivers. The ability to deliver increasing TCO, which -- if we can deliver increasing TCO, we can continue to drive pricing higher. We can produce it at very high scale, it can be qualified very, very quickly and it's very highly reliable and high quality product. And our customers are increasingly adopting that technology as you see from our forecast. Thanks. The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Yes, look, I think we're going to see it as we start to go into PC refresh cycles. We admitted that, we're still very early in this, right? Getting the cloud -- I mean the big part right now is getting the cloud capable of delivering GenAI to all of us, and then drive that architecture, down to the edge. I think we're starting to see in some of the markets some of the future specs of products where they're increasing the amount of NAND, so we're optimistic about that. As we go through the next couple of years when this architecture gets deployed and adopted. So I can't like put it down to a particular quarter for you, but certainly as new technology launches or new technology adoption, it's moving at a faster pace than any technology I've seen in the very long time. Thanks, Wamsi. Yes, we see demand around mid-teens and that's fab out. What we see is kind of fab production of mid-single digits. And obviously, there's inventory between those. You did not misunderstand me. We'll ship to our share demand throughout the year. Go ahead, Mehdi. I'm sorry. No, please go ahead. Thank you. Well, I mean, for us it was a -- it's an emerging -- it's an emerging part of the portfolio. I think, right -- going right into the downturn, we got qualified at numerous or a number of cloud titans in our NVMe based enterprise SSD, and then we kind of went into a market where, quite frankly, enterprise SSD has been the most depressed part of the NAND market in the downturn and we haven't seen that come back yet. So, as that starts to come back out of digestion, it'll just be another opportunity for us to mix into that. How much we mix into it will be depending on what the price is on that -- in that segment versus other options we have for those bits. So we don't necessarily -- we don't necessarily have a fixed percentage we're going for, it's just -- we have the product, it's qualified, as demand comes back, we'll consider that demand and part of the whole portfolio calculus. Well, certainly, it is trailing enterprise HDD. I mean, enterprise -- I don't know if I could make a generalization about that, because it's just one cycle here, but clearly there's more inventory digestion in the hyperscale market on enterprise SSD than there was in capacity enterprise HDDs. As we talked about, we see continued growth in capacity enterprise HDDs, we started out this fiscal year projecting sequential growth throughout the fiscal year and now we're talking about sequential growth throughout the calendar year. So we see good demand trends coming back on capacity enterprise HDD, which again is a good sign for enterprise SSDs will come back, because there's a little -- there's more inventory digestion to get through. Thank you. I don't see that at this point. Thank you. It's a good point here, which is, like -- my comments earlier were about the cycle and what we see in NAND and investing in. And we're big believers in the NAND market and there's going to be a lot of bit growth in the future. And also the great thing about the NAND market is, you still have the ability to produce new nodes and more efficient as far as how much capital you need to put in to get that growth. So, look, the overall thesis on NAND continuing to grow, we have a long technology roadmap where we can continue to deliver cost downs, that's still a great story and we expect -- to your point, we expect generative AI to be additive to that, especially on the edge. The NAND market has really rotated -- through this downturn really rotated to an edge centric market. Which, again, our portfolio is very, very well positioned with our consumer business, with our client SSD business, with our gaming business, with our position with PC OEMs. So, we're very well positioned there. And yes, as we see that demand come back, and it resets the economics of the industry, we have the ability to go satisfy that demand. And so, I think you are very bullish about that. Thank you. All right, thanks everyone. I appreciate your time today. We will see you throughout the quarter. Take care."

            "name": "Wissam Jabre",
            "content": "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, the success of the strategy we have been executing is reflected in our financial performance. Non-GAAP results in the fiscal second quarter exceeded or were at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Total revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, up 10% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.69, as strong execution with our broad go-to-market channels benefited Flash ASP and gross margin. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 23% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth is attributed to higher nearline shipments to that of center customers and better nearline pricing. Nearline bit shipments were 67 exabytes, up 23%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower eSSD bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, HDD cloud revenue increased for the first time in six quarters. Client represented 37% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 2% sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, an increase in Flash ASP was more than offset by a decline in flash bit shipments. The year-over-year increase was due to higher flash shipments, primarily driven by client SSD shipments into PC applications, more than offsetting a decline in ASP. Consumer represented 28% of total revenue at $0.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth was primarily due to seasonal strength in Flash bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in Flash bit shipments was partially offset by a decline in Flash ASP, as well as lower HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by business segment. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, growing 7% sequentially, as Flash ASPs increased 10% on a blended basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis, stronger than anticipated entering the quarter. Bid shipments decreased 2% after record shipments in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Flash revenue grew slightly with a 21% increase in bit shipments, offsetting lower prices. HDD revenue was $1.4 billion, increasing 14% sequentially. As total exabyte shipments increased 14%, an average price per unit increased 9% to $122. On a year-over-year basis, HDD revenue declined 6%, while total exabyte shipments increased 2% and average price per unit increased 23%. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 15.5% above the guidance range provided in October and improving 11.4 percentage points sequentially, while declining 1.9 percentage points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher Flash ASPs as we proactively optimized product mix, which more than offset higher than anticipated underutilization charges of $156 million or a 5.1 percentage points headwind. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 7.9%, up 18.2 percentage points sequentially, and down 6.6 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $107 million or a 6.4 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 24.8%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and 4.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $49 million or a 3.6 percentage point headwind. We continue to tightly manage operating expenses, which were $561 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year, and at the lower end of the guidance range. Operating loss in the quarter was $91 million, which included underutilization charges of $156 million. Fiscal second quarter loss per share was $0.69, inclusive of a $14 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred shares. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $92 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $176 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. The quarter ending inventory was $3.2 billion, declining $281 million from the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased five days to 115 days. The majority of the decline was in Flash, where Flash days of inventory remained at a four-year low. During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in convertible notes, repurchased $508 million of the outstanding 2024 convertible notes and paid down $300 million of the delayed draw term loan. Gross debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. We expect to retire the remaining balance of approximately $600 million of the 2024 convertible notes at maturity in February 2024. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion and total liquidity was $4.7 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. For the fiscal third quarter, our non GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to of $3.4 billion; we expect sequential revenue growth to be mainly driven by an increase in HDD; we anticipate Flash revenue to be up slightly as we remain focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP; we expect gross margin to be between 22% and 24%, which includes HDD underutilization charges of $30 million to $40 million; we expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million with the increase driven by the reinstatement of certain incentive compensation programs as the financial outlook has strengthened. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $95 million. We continue to expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal third quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect earnings per share to be $0.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 330 million shares outstanding. As the financial outlook has improved, we will remain disciplined in executing the business, proactively managing our supply and inventory to meet customer end demand and controlling capital spending, all with the goal of improving profitability. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Now, I was going to move on to the second part of your question. Okay. So mix is like -- mix is just a very dynamic process, literally day-by-day, week-by-week in the business. We have a big consumer franchise, we sell all over the world, we have hundreds of thousands of points of presence and retail platforms. We have a big channel business where pricing can get adjusted weekly, then all the way up to, obviously, the quarterly negotiated markets. So we're just always dynamically understanding where pricing is going to be. And then again, in each of those segments, we have different products. We have client SSDs that are WD Black all the way down to WD Green. So in different segments of the market, all with different price points, all with different margins, all with different demand profiles. And it's a constant process of just making sure we put the supply where we're going to get the best return. This last quarter we talked about, we mixed a little bit out of client and into consumer, as you would expect in a strong consumer quarter. And we'll continue to do that. The place where we're still waiting for it to come back is enterprise SSD, that's still been pretty depressed and as that market starts to come back, we expect to mix into that as well. Yes, of course, CJ. So on the OpEx side, for the June quarter I expect us to be more or less in line. Beyond that, as the business profitability continues to improve, I expect a gradual increase. But we're laser focused on profitability and so I don't anticipate to increase our OpEx faster than revenue growth, of course. And when you look at look at where we've come from and where we are today. We're still at or maybe more than 20% lower than where we were at the beginning of the cyclical downturn. So, Tom, if you look at our numbers and you adjust for the underutilization charges, we're almost there. So, what I would say, instead of giving a number or movement, let's say, in quantifying it. What I would say is, I expect us to be at the 30% level, at a lower level than then our normal run rate that we've had in any priors through-cycle periods. We've taken quite a bit of cost out of our -- cost structure as you very well know. And so, that will help us get there at a faster phase. With respect to underutilization, I do anticipate to probably have a bit more in other quarter of underutilization beyond this one and then we'll see where we are in the June quarter. We can talk about it then. You're welcome. No, we don't anticipant that to impact our market share. The stats that you mentioned on the supply and production were for our estimates and what we see from third party estimates on the overall market. No, we're comfortable with the 15% cost downs. We believe that if you -- I mean, we're ahead of that right now in FY 2024, quite frankly, but it'll come back and I think when you look at the full year, you can still model 15% for the fiscal year. Yeah, Mark. So turning free cash flow positive is a top priority for us. We are very much focussed on it and we have line of site to achieving it. We expect to achieve free cash flow positive in the second half of the fiscal 2023, either this quarter on the next. As you know, we typically don't guide for cash flow. Thanks, Mark."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Peter Andrew, VP of FP&A and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nPeter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, we have a lot of exciting items to discuss today. In addition to the earnings press release and slides, we also have a press release and slides regarding the conclusion of our strategic review. All of these materials will be posted in the investor relations section of our website shortly. Let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations and as such does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, spending and cost reductions, business plans and performance, market trends, financial results, the outcome of a potential separation of our HDD and flash businesses, including the form, timing, and tax-free status of the transaction, our ability to complete the transaction, the future performance of our separated businesses, and the creation of shareholder value by separating our businesses. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliation between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the investor relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I will first discuss the completion of the strategic review and then turn to our first quarter results. We're thrilled to announce the completion of our strategic review and plans to form two independent public companies focused on capitalizing on the data storage industry's growth in HDD and flash. After evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives, the Western Digital management team and Board determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. This transaction will allow each franchise to execute on its product and innovation roadmap and capitalize on the unique growth opportunities in their respective end markets. Each company will benefit from streamlined management focus, operational flexibility, and the ability to set its own distinct capital allocation and shareholder return policies. We are excited for the opportunities this transaction creates to better serve our customers, support our suppliers, partners, and employees, and unlock significant value for our shareholders. Before discussing the details, let me walk you through the journey that brought us to this point. In March 2020, I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the company's unique position to accelerate and benefit from the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company, and how all of us live our daily lives. And importantly, I saw an opportunity to create value for a leader in both NAND flash and hard drives. During my early days at the company, I spent considerable energy into rebuilding and refocusing the company, including the formation of the HDD and flash business units. It soon became clear that our focus on driving two distinct technology portfolios was the right strategy, and the new management team that I brought and worked together to transform Western Digital by bolstering business agility and reinvigorating innovation. In addition, we promptly focused on strengthening our balance sheet. We made the tough decision to suspend our dividend, which allowed Western Digital to speed up debt reduction and paid down $2.7 billion of debt over a couple of years following the suspension. We further enhanced our liquidity by bringing in $900 million of strategic investment from Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management and amended our credit agreements. We also settled a long-standing tax dispute to increase strategic optionality. The groundwork we laid over the past several years, including the additional actions taken in fiscal year \u201823 to right-size the business, have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment, all while staying focused on delivering a range of industry-leading products. Each business is now in a strong operational position to succeed on its own and the actions we are announcing today will further enable each company to drive long-term success in the years to come. The Western Digital team and Board completed the strategic review after evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives and determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. During our strategic review process, we evaluated material opportunities for each of our businesses. However, given current constraints, it has become clearer to the board in recent weeks that delivering a standalone separation is the right next step in the evolution of Western Digital and puts the company in the best position to unlock value for our shareholders, while providing strategic optionality for both businesses. Given the confidential nature of the strategic review, we will not be discussing any of the other alternatives that were considered during the process. On page six of the presentation, we present a separation transaction summary. The HDD business will retain the Western Digital name and become an independent publicly traded company. The flash business is expected to be spun-off in a tax-free transaction to Western Digital shareholders, and the name of the publicly traded company will be determined at a later time. We target to complete these plans in the second-half of calendar year \u201824, subject to the principal closing conditions described in the slide. Page seven provides a bit more visibility into some of the end market exposure for our flash and HDD businesses on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving to the individual businesses on page eight. In HDD, Western Digital is a well-known leader in the mass storage market with an ability to generate consistent cash flow on a standalone basis. Our ability to lead the industry in bringing new innovations to the hard drive market to enable higher capacity points for mass market adoption has established Western Digital as a key strategic supplier to the world's global cloud service providers, storage OEM, and distributors. The massive opportunity is driven by the ongoing expansion of the cloud infrastructure, connected to intelligent endpoints and powered by high-speed networks. Industry analysts estimate the HDD addressable market to grow at approximately 12% compounded annual growth rate to $25 billion over the next three years with cloud representing over 90% of the total addressable market. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital and we are well positioned to address customer storage needs. Moving to our flash business on page 10. The Western Digital flash business is well-known for its broad go-to-market channels, enviable premium brand retail franchise, and strong client SSD portfolio. Industry analysts forecast the flash market to grow at approximately 15% compounded annual growth rate over the next three years to $89 billion in calendar year 2025. We believe content increases in the consumer and client end markets, as well as explosive growth of data created in the cloud by emerging applications such as generative AI, virtual reality, and autonomous driving, are driving a faster growth in flash versus HDD. The highlight of our consumer end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and our suite of high-performance SSDs for gaming enthusiasts. The brand recognition and affinity, combined with our unmatched presence across the world, is a great setup for the business on a standalone basis. Our successful 23-year partnership with Kioxia continues to provide us a reliable source of high-performance, low-cost flash. Together, we have successfully brought to market numerous generations of flash technology with the industry's lowest cost and best capital efficiency. The joint venture fabs produce over 30% of the world's bits and our joint memory technology roadmap remains incredibly well positioned especially as we lead the industry's transition to wafer bonding. We will likely host an investor day closer to the time of the spin-off of our flash business to give investors greater clarity into the historical and future outlook for each of our businesses, along with the intended capital structures for each business. With that, I'd like to turn to first quarter fiscal \u201824 earnings review and business update. Western Digital's first quarter results exceeded our expectations as the team's efforts to bolster a business agility, drive innovation, and right-size the business have enabled us to capitalize on enhanced earning power in an improving environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $2.75 billion and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.76. Our ability to develop differentiated and innovative products across a broad range of end markets has resulted in sequential margin improvement across both flash and HDD businesses. In flash, healthy inventory levels on our balance sheet and signs that flash pricing is beginning to inflect have laid the groundwork for further gross margin improvements. Our broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise, and strong client SSD portfolio have enabled us to shift bits to the most attractive end market categories and achieve 26% sequential bit growth, as well as upside and gross margin. In HDD, our industry leading 26 terabyte ultra-SMR drive became the highest near-line volume runner in just two quarters, which demonstrates Western Digital's aerial density leadership and ability to deliver high volume innovative technologies to data center customers worldwide. During the quarter, demand in consumer and client continued to improve, exceeding our expectations. In consumer, flash revenue has returned to growth on a year-over-year basis, led by strong content increases and unit growth. In client, PC and component demand also exceeded our expectations, and demand for gaming consoles and mobile remained resilient. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remains subdued. I'll now turn to the business updates starting with flash. During the quarter, flash revenue increased sequentially, led by record exabyte shipments and continued content growth in consumer and client end markets, including PCs and all retail products, as we continue to optimize bit placement in an improving environment. WD Black, which is optimized for gaming, continued to perform well, with bits shipments more than doubling and content per unit increasing over 50% year-over-year. We are in an excellent position from both of flash technology and capital efficiency perspective. Today, a majority of products we are shipping are based on BiCS5, the most capital efficient node in the 3D era that continues to provide an amazing cost structure and efficient capital spending. As we look into calendar year \u201824, we are ramping an array of QLC-based client SSDs based on BiCS6 technology to lead the expected industry transition to QLC. After BiCS6, we remain on track to introduce a broad range of high performance products based on BiCS8 technology with its unique chip bonded on array architecture. Turning to HDD, revenue declined due to lower nearline exabyte shipments driven by subdued demand from our cloud customers and slower-than-expected recovery in China. However, demand for consumer and client hard drives was stable. Western Digital has continued to lead the industry in driving innovation within the nearline market. Our ability to bring innovation into mass market drives that are quickly deployed into cloud data centers is reflected in our results as we successfully led the industry's transition to SMR-based nearline drives. Specifically, our 26 terabyte ultra-SMR drive, which we first announced at our investor day, accounted for nearly half of our nearline exabyte shipments with total SMR shipments exceeding the 40% goal we laid out in the same quarter a year prior. We are on track with our 28 terabyte ultra-SMR drive qualification and have a clear roadmap of EPMR and ultra-SMR based innovations into the 40 terabyte range. These developments are a result of the choices we have made in the past few years through a combination of product R&D and manufacturing capabilities, and we are proud of how we have been executing against our strategy. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, in flash we expect both modest bit and ASP improvement and a decline in underutilization charges to drive continued sequential improvement in both revenue and gross margin. In HDD, we expect higher nearline shipments and seasonal demand in consumer end market to drive sequential revenue growth. We anticipate our value-based pricing efforts and lower underutilization charges will lead to sequential revenue and gross margin improvement in the quarter and through the rest of fiscal year \u201824. As we continue to execute against our HDD product roadmap, we are setting the stage for profitable growth for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.\nWissam Jabre: Thank you and good morning everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal first quarter results exceeded the guidance ranges provided in July. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.75 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.76. Looking at end markets for the fiscal first quarter, cloud represented 32% of total revenue at $0.9 billion, down 12% sequentially, and 52% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to lower nearline hard drive shipments to data center customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in shipments for both hard drive and flash products. Client represented 42% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 11% sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was due to growth in flash-bit shipments. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in flash pricing. Consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.7 billion, up 14% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by both higher content per unit and increased unit shipments in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal first quarter, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 13% sequentially, and down 10% year-over-year. This marks the second consecutive quarter of sequential increase. Sequentially, flash ASPs decreased 10% on a blended basis, and 4% on a like-for-like basis. We shipped a record amount of flash bits in the quarter with shipments increasing 26%, sequentially and 49% year-over-year. HDD revenue was $1.2 billion, down 8% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 5%, and average price per unit increased 13% to $112. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 42% and average price per unit decreased 10%. Moving to gross margin and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 4.1%, which was at the higher end of the guidance range provided in July, and included $225 million in underutilization expenses and $9 million in other one-time charges. In total, these charges represented an 8.5 percentage point headwind to gross margin. Flash gross margin was negative 10.3%. Underutilization charges due to reduced manufacturing volumes were $142 million and flash inventory write-downs were $9 million, resulting in a combined 9.7 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 22.9%. Underutilization charges were higher-than-expected at $83 million or a 7 percentage point headwind to gross margin. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were down 19% year-over-year to $555 million, well below our guidance range. Operating loss was $443 million, which included underutilization charges and inventory write-downs totaling $234 million. Income tax expense in the fiscal first quarter was $25 million. Net loss per share was $1.76, inclusive of a $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was an outflow of $626 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $544 million. Free cash flow included a payment of $523 million for the IRS settlement and $191 million cash receipt from the sale and lease back of our facility in Milpitas, California. Inventory declined $201 million sequentially to $3.5 billion. Days of inventory declined 10 days to 120 days. Flash inventory declined by nearly $400 million, driven by record bit shipments in the quarter and proactive actions taken to reduce wafer starts. Days of inventory for flash have reached the lowest level in nearly four years. HDD inventory grew by nearly $200 million, due to the timing of certain purchases and lower-than-expected shipments. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment, including the proceeds from our sale lease back of our Milpitas facility, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement, represented a net cash inflow of $82 million. In the fiscal first quarter, we fully drew the $600 million delayed-draft term loan facility. Gross debt outstanding was $7.7 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $4.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. For fiscal second quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be led by higher nearline HDD shipments and improved pricing in flash. We continue to adjust production into the second quarter to better align supply with demand and anticipate lower underutilization charges in both flash and HDD. For our fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 10% and 12%, which includes underutilization charges across flash and HDD, totaling $110 million to $130 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $560 million and $580 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal second quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect a loss per share of $1.35 to $1.05, assuming approximately 325 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. We are now emerging from a historic storage cyclical downturn, where all of the changes made in the past several years were evident in how well each business performed relative to peers. The first quarter of fiscal \u201824 builds upon the improvements we made in fiscal year \u201823 around discipline, supply, and capital expenditure management, while executing on our product innovation roadmap. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses and are closely monitoring demand in our end markets to appropriately manage our inventory in both flash and HDD, all to improve sequential and year-over-year upside in our results. Moving forward, as we progress through fiscal year \u201824, we see an improving market environment in both businesses. With an improved position, the separation of the company unlocks value by creating two independent public companies with market-specific strategic focus. Better positions each franchise to execute innovative technology and product development, capitalize on unique growth opportunities, extend respective leadership positions, and operate more efficiently with distinct capital structures. Okay, Peter, let's open up for Q&A.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. And congratulations on the decision here. Can you talk through a little bit anything preliminary in terms of how the OpEx might be a portion between the two businesses and you mentioned, you know, maybe you'll give us the capital structure at a later date, but just anything early on, unlike, you know, what you think the right amount of debt is to apportion to the two businesses?\nWissam Jabre: Hey, Joe, good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, it's a little bit too premature to talk about details with respect to each side of the business or each company as we get closer to the separation will be in a better position to talk about much more details with respect to OpEx apportionment, as well as capital structures, leverage targets, and capital return policies, et cetera.\nDavid Goeckeler: Hey Joe, this is David. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you this morning. One thing I will say is we're very happy with the level of efficiency we've driven into the business over the last year, especially during this downturn, and we think has put us in a very good position to go through this transaction. I think OpEx over two years is down, over the last two years is down over $200 million. So we put ourselves in a position where we've got very efficient business and some flexibility to go through a transaction like this. So as Wissam said, we'll have more to say as we get closer.\nJoe Moore: Okay. And then I wonder if I could just ask more tactically in terms of the need to pay down the convert early next year, how you're thinking about that and whether this, you know, the strategic change here changes anything in terms of your ability to do convert issuance or things like that, pay that down?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, Joe, the current announcement does not affect our ability to address the convert. As we've said before, our plan is to address the convert that's maturing in Feb \u201824 by the end of this calendar year.\nJoe Moore: Okay, thank you very much.\nWissam Jabre: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Two, if I can as well, real quick. I guess the first question is just thinking about the separation, appreciating that you're not going to give anything at this point around the capital structure. I'm just curious though, the relationship with Kioxia, you know, I know in the past there's been certain attributes of rights as part of the JV. Any kind of context about the dialogue, you know, moving to the separation as it relates to that JV rights or, you know, should we be thinking about any approval processes that are involved in that?\nDavid Goeckeler: No. So first off, the relationship with Kioxia is outstanding and it has been for a very, very long time so we expect that to continue on absolutely it's a -- provides a tremendous foundation for our NAND business with both very capital efficient NAND and a tremendous roadmap as we're going into BiCS8 here. But we can execute this transaction without any other approvals.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, and then as a quick follow up, I'm just curious on the hard disk drive business. I know the cloud revenue and total is down consistently, again, quarter-over-quarter. Just how would you characterize what you're seeing from a nearline perspective from the cloud? Have you started to see demand pull again? Just any kind of context of how you're thinking about, you know, the shaping of kind of a recovery here as we move forward?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we think this past quarter was the bottom, Aaron, and we see improving demand as we move throughout the fiscal year on a quarter-over-quarter basis. You know, we've had certain customers that have been on the sidelines for a while, and they're starting to come back and give us visibility into ordering. So we expect the market to recover from here going forward.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them too. First one, again, sorry to harp on the separation, it makes a lot of sense. I'm just kind of curious. In the past, David, you've spoken about some of the synergies in R&D and how the HDD product line uses some of the bomb from OptiNAND et cetera. I'm just kind of curious, would that change post the separation, or there's going to be no strategic shift on that, and then I had a follow-up?\nDavid Goeckeler: So there's no, the separation doesn't imply any change in strategy for either business. So both of them will continue to go forward. No change in our product roadmaps. We feel very good about what's been built over the last three, four years. We feel like we're in a market-leading position in both franchises, both from a product point of view, if you look at what's happened in the hard drive business, you know, it's very, very clear now the adoption of SMR is the next big step in the cloud data center and that's progressing very well. Our 26-T drive just became the highest shipping drive in the quarter. And we, you know, we announced the next generation that with the 28-T, as well so no change there, you know, OptiNAND still a big part of that architecture and the team will be able to procure that and continue to drive that part of the strategy. And on the flash side of the business, the portfolio is also in great shape with both for product strategy and also the branding strategy. SanDisk, WD Black, these brands continue to perform extremely well. So we think it's a great setup for both businesses going forward.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, thanks for that David. Another quick follow-up, your peers spoke about the HAMR Technology getting like adopted next year, and your road map shows EPMR to extending to 32 plus terabyte,. I'm kind of curious how you think about HAMR and your road map in case they'll catch up with C8?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, look we put a lot of optionality in our roadmap a number of years ago, so that we could extend the capacity points with things like OptiNAND, SMR, Ultra-SMR, EPMR, so that strategy is working very, very well. We're leading the industry in capacity points. We expect to be able to drive this strategy into the 40 terabyte range on our drives. HAMR is in development, it's going well, and we'll be able to fold that into our roadmap at the appropriate time. But for now, we've got a great roadmap, we've got a market-leading roadmap, we're leading the adoption of SMR into the cloud data center and we expect, you know, we have many more generations to go on our current roadmap and then we'll move to HAMR at the appropriate time when it's mature and we can build it at scale and it'll be the next leg of growth into the future.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, David.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you, Krish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi, yes, thank you so much. Good morning. Back to the transaction, I guess, can you maybe talk a little bit about all the actions that you have taken that might be preventing some of the dissynergies that typically occur in terms of standard costs when there is separation of the business? Can you maybe A, address that? And B, on your comments on the roadmap, Ultra-SMR, EPMR, you have a lot of options. You've noted scaling up to 40 TV. Can you just talk about what the cost of that, how that would compare to, you know, your own future HAMR roadmap and give us some sense of how cost competitive you think these products would be? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Okay. So, on the first one, yes, I mean, Wamsi, I think you kind of laid it out there. We've been going through a whole series of actions that have set us up for this announcement. You know, it was really about execute the business better and give ourselves as much strategic optionality as possible. So as I talked about in the prepared remarks we've, you know, we separated ourselves in the business units on the product side that allows us to really get very focused on the portfolio and all the OpEx we spend on building our products, make sure we get the best return for it. I think that's worked out well. We then did the same thing in operations. We've now divided those organizations around HDD and flash. So we\u2019ve -- and then we've optimized, taken out cost everywhere we can so that we can operate them independently and also have just the most efficient business possible. As I said, we've focused on our balance sheet. So I think we've put ourselves in a very good position where we can go through this separation and the organization is as prepared as we possibly can be for it. We've also, as I said earlier, we've taken a lot of OpEx out of the business. So we've driven the OpEx down to a very efficient number. So we believe we can go through the separation and end up with two very well-structured companies that can execute very well. And they come out of the gate with market-leading portfolios on each side and into a recovering market. So we feel good about that. Cost of the portfolio look I mean as you continue we feel the roadmap we have in place, you know, we can produce ultra-SMR, EPMR, OptiNAND drives very high scale, very quickly, very high yields on all the products. So we think the cost position is very advantageous. You see that in our results, you know, so you know when HAMR comes will fold that in and you know we want to get to the point where we have the same level of yields we have the same level of confidence as we do something like a 26-T drive that we just launched and now it's the, you know, nearly half of our exabytes, a quarter or two in. And that's how we think about launching new products. So you know, when we get there, I think that we'll have that same kind of cost structure on HAMR, and we have a great, very, very strong position to drive very efficient, very high scale, very quickly, new drives for many generations on the technology that we've put in place over the last three or four years.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, Dave.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nSidney Ho: Thank you. Congrats on the announcement today. Understanding you have amended the debt covenants back in June, given the announced transaction, how are you thinking about the covenants over the next few quarters, specifically with the free cash flow before the transaction is closed? And does that limit the amount of CapEx you could spend in the meantime? And I'll follow up.\nWissam Jabre: Yes. Good morning, Sidney. Thanks for the question. The current announcement does not affect the amended credit agreements. And so from a free cash flow, from a governance perspective, we're comfortable that we can operate effectively. We have ample liquidity. We do have ample operational flexibility to operate, so I don't see the current announcement as impacting us in any way.\nSidney Ho: Okay. My follow-up is, if you look at the fiscal second quarter guidance, if you can walk us through your assumptions that drive 7 points of increase in gross margin, that would be great. It looks like under your utilization charges coming down, are there benefits from sales of previously written down inventory? And what are you expecting in terms of price increases in both flash and hard disk drive on a like-for-like basis. Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Okay, maybe I'll start a little bit on the cost side and then David could chime in on the top line side. Look, the -- when -- one of the bigger, obviously, levers is the underutilization. We did in Q1, around $225 million. In total, we had around $234 million to 235 million of other charges. And our guide has a underutilization at a much lower level, and so that's one element. In addition, obviously, we continue to focus on cost reduction. We do have still, we're still, if you exclude the underutilization aspect, we're still taking cost out of the system on both the flash side and the HDD side. And so that's a key lever to improve the gross margin. And then if I take it back up to the top line, we see obviously improvement on the revenue side and the improvement is coming from both sides of the house on both businesses. So that also contributes quite well with respect to the gross margin and within that revenue also we do have a bit of a mix that's helping us as well.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, Sidney, I guess, what I would add is, if you look at the HDD business, we're ramping new products, right? The 26-T drive is ramping rapidly. And we also have an improving pricing environment in drives, which is a nice tailwind. And then in flash, we have an improving pricing environment as well, as Wissam said, a better mix. And we expect that business to inflect a positive gross margin next quarter, which is a great milestone for us as we continue the recovery of the business.\nSidney Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nTom O'Malley: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on your expectations for both market demand on the NAND exabyte side for fiscal year \u201824, as well as your view of supply. I mean, you're starting the year up almost 50% year-over-year, obviously off a very low base and sequentially up mid-20s. Some of your peers have talked about really demand here to begin the fiscal year or to begin the recovery in those -- for those other guys, but kind of some slowing as guys saw the bottom ordered a bunch and then have kind of slowed down. Could you just give me your comments on if you're seeing any of that and then your expectations for the exabyte shipments for you for the fiscal year?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, so, you know, we have seen an acceleration here at the end of \u201823. We've raised our demand number quite a bit into the mid-teens for \u201923, we'll get to \u201824. You know, some of that, you know, there has been some strategic buys as part of that. I know that's been a big discussion in the industry, but we\u2019d also just see the markets returning to normal inventory levels. So for us, that's been more of what's been happening and a good mix across the businesses. For \u201824 we see high-teens, kind of, demand and we continue to see production significantly below that.\nTom O'Malley: Helpful, and then on the other side of the business, you talked about the, kind of, you know, varied inventory positions you have, flash going down, HDD actually going up a bit. And if you compare your results with Seagate, at least for the last couple of quarters, results have been relatively similar. Could you just talk about when we should start to see that divergence, just given the fact that you're addressing a higher capacity point in the market today, and theoretically you should see some outside benefit. When do you think you'll start to see that divergence in the market? Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Divergence in what aspect, Tom?\nTom O'Malley: In terms of revenue difference.\nWissam Jabre: So we're managing the business for profitability on HDD. I mean, I think it's, you know, we and I think we are driving a more profitable business. So that, that's the way we think about the business and driving back to our model, which we expect to get back to here over the next several quarters. Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, thank you. Good morning, guys. David, on the HDD comments that you see growth throughout the fiscal year, just looking for some additional color, just kind of listening to some of your customers and the big hyperscalers. I think the CapEx comments have been fairly mixed and I'm just curious as to how broad-based this recovery that you're seeing is. Is it primarily driven by the inventory work-downs or anything else that's driving it? And also, if you can comment on by geography, I think, you said China was weak in the quarter, if you could talk about how -- what\u2019s your expectation for China business is going forward?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I think you got it there in your question. I think you have more broad-based participation in the market by the big hyperscalers as they get to the end of their inventory corrections. So that's been part of it. Remember, we're coming off very, very, very low numbers. So we expect improvement throughout the year by more people participating in the market and more consistent participation by the ones that have been in it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. China has been -- it\u2019s been better, but not -- it hasn't recovered as fast as we expected, so it's still a little bit lumpy and weaker than we would like. So the smart video market has been pretty consistent and we've seen some good results there. But in the cloud space, it still has a little ways to go.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. And then a cash flow question for Wissam. I guess, I'm just curious, you had an IRS payment due during the quarter. Did you make that payment? I see like a $300 million impact from the tax. And then if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes in terms of free cash flow for next quarter, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, sure. So on the tax payment, in Q1 we made a $523 million payment with respect to the IRS settlement. This covers the years 2008 through 2012. And so this is why you see when you look at our free cash flow that we reported for fiscal Q1 at a negative $544 million, in that we had that $523 million payment. On the -- it was partially offset by the sale and lease back of the Milpitas facilities of around $191 million. So all in all, we're around the negative $200 million for the quarter. As we look forward, obviously, the key is the continuous improvement of the profitability and of the business, working capital management. You've seen our transition on the inventory side, for instance, in Q1. We continue to manage inventory very, very closely on both flash and HDD. So I expect that inventory to continue to decline gradually in this coming quarter and the next. And then the continued focus on CapEx for the fiscal year. Would it say that for fiscal \u201824 we expect our cash CapEx to be significantly lower than fiscal 2023. So, you know, free cash flow is, and cash flow is very important to us, big focus, and we'll continue to focus on it. And as we look into the second-half of fiscal \u201824, we're projecting to be cash flow positive on a quarterly basis in the second-half of this fiscal year.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. Good morning.\nDavid Goeckeler: Good morning, Karl.\nKarl Ackerman: Hey, good morning. When do you anticipate NAND underutilization charges to abate? And then second, you indicated that NAND and HDD bit shipments will recover in December. I guess for NAND, will that be primarily tied to consumer applications, or do you expect enterprise to be the larger driver over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, I'll take the second part of that, and Wissam can comment on the underutilization charges. Look, we expect bits to be up slightly in the December quarter. It's a strong consumer quarter for us, although we don't really break out by mix. But I mean, I think that's one way to think about it. We expect an improving price environment and bits to be slightly up.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, and with respect to underutilization, Karl, we do manage our supply very dynamically. And so we guided this quarter based on what we see today. We do expect underutilization to continue in the third fiscal quarter, maybe a little bit lower than here, but it's a bit too early to cover the quarters beyond the next one.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question. Actually the next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go with your question.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. David, at the bottom of slide four, you did say that the board remains open to considering other alternatives should they become available. So since you put that in the presentation, can you talk about what other options could be available? Is this a reference to the collapse of the JV that Hynix commented about or was asked about on its call? Is this in reference to an outright sale of the NAND business? Can you just talk about that a little more?\nDavid Goeckeler: No, it's not in reference to any particular thing. It just says that we think this is the best next step for the business to unlock value. We think that, you know, we put the business in a position to go through this right now. It's all the reasons we talked about from the portfolio to where we are on efficiency point of view to where we are on the work we've done to retire debt. And also going into an improving market. But I think any company is always open to other strategic options should they become available and we'll consider them at that time. Although I do want to be very clear that the strategic review is completed and any conversations that were going on as a part of that have ended. And we're very excited about this step forward. We think it's the best next step for the business. But I think in any business, you're always going to be open. If there's other strategic options that become available, we will thoroughly consider those at the time.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. And then, Wissam, for you, so the underutilization charges of $120 million at the midpoint, how do they split for December? I would think that more of its now in the HDD business, but how does that split things?\nWissam Jabre: Yes, the split of the underage utilization is two-thirds flash and one-third HDD.\nTimothy Arcuri: Great, thank you, Wissam.\nWissam Jabre: You're welcome.\nOperator: And our next question does come from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.\nVijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. Just a quick question if you went to it already. When you look at the hard disk size, I'm wondering if you had, you know, what the exabyte growth was for the last two years and what you're seeing as you look forward with this, seems like a little bit of a bounce coming through. What do you expect for fiscal \u201824, fiscal \u201825, or calendar \u201824, let's say, yes.\nDavid Goeckeler: So yes, we, I mean, coming off such a high on \u201822, \u201823 will be down, but then we expect to get back to, we expect a consistent exabyte growth in this business in the mid to high-20 range on an ongoing basis.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. And the same on the NAND side, with the spin-off, do you see any change in the technology roadmap? How do you see the 218 BiCS, next generation BiCS coming? And if you can also give us your expectation on NAND bit growth for \u201823 and \u201824?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, no, we don't expect any change in the technology roadmap. The JV is very strong, very solid, very productive. Teams work together on a day-by-day basis. We've talked a lot about that. We're very happy with where it's at. The relationship is very strong. The technology roadmap, we think, as we talked about last time with BiCS8 and wafer bonding, we've made a huge step forward there. You know, we've always been able to produce NAND at a better capital intensity than the rest of the industry. Our measures over the last several years are up to a third less capital intensity for the business. So the JV has been strong for \u201823 plus years and we expect it to be strong for very, very far into the future. So we feel very good about that.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. Any thoughts on the bit growth I guess for \u201824 and as the next generation, as the next bit stage starts to ramp I guess? Thanks.\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we expect demand in \u201824 in the NAND business to be high-teens, you know, and if it gets really strong maybe it'll creep over the 20s and low-20s, but we're thinking about those high teens numbers. And like I said, production will be significantly below that.\nVijay Rakesh: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good morning. Congratulations\u2026\nDavid Goeckeler: Good morning, Harlan.\nHarlan Sur: \u2026on the strategic. Yes, congratulations on the strategic actions announced today. On the flash technology side, the JV brings strong synergies in flash manufacturing development and manufacturing scale. Excluding the underutilization charges, you guys have been driving down the underlying cost per bit at around a mid-teens type CAGR and in line with your prior targets and that's even with the rising capital intensity, right? As you look ahead, BiCS6 transition moved to bonded architecture on BiCS8. Does the team believe it can sustain its mid-teens cost down profile?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yes, we do. We feel very good about that. I mean, I've spoken about this in the past. It's an explicit goal of the technology team to continue to drive those cost downs and we feel good about our ability to do that. It's been one of the strengths of the JV and the JV technology team for a very long time.\nHarlan Sur: Well, thank you for that. And then on the flash portfolio side within SSD, particularly the team has been in a very, very strong number two market share position in client SSD, very strong portfolio. In enterprise and cloud, however, you've been consistently in the sort of number five, number six global market share position. So as you think about spinning out the flash business, what is the team doing to improve its competitiveness in its enterprise and cloud SSD portfolio?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, we like the portfolio we have. We qualified our NVMe based enterprise SSD at multiple cloud providers. And unfortunately, we qualified right into a significant downturn in cloud consumption of enterprise SSDs. So as that starts to come back over the next several quarters and as we go through \u201824, we expect our position to improve as those vendors start consuming again. I mean, the reality is there's just not a lot of buying in that market going on right now.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead with your question.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you. David, I just want to go back to your comment just made regarding enterprise SSD. When I look at the slides from the results of a strategic review, you're highlighting strengthening client SSD and also retail. But I don't see any mention of enterprise SSD. How should I reconcile that with the comment you just made?\nDavid Goeckeler: Well, I mean, it's because those are two very, very strong strengths of the portfolio. I think they're very unique. Look, our retail franchise is a real gem. I mean, it's a big part of the portfolio. It provides better through cycle profitability. We've done a lot of work on building brands over the last several years. I mean, we've already had very, very strong brands in SanDisk. I think everybody knows SanDisk is the premier brand in the industry. We've built the BLACK brand around gaming now. That's a significant part of the portfolio. I think we're the preferred provider in gaming. We talked about it this quarter, where 50% year-over-year content increases in devices and doubling the number of bits in that. So it's been, you know, it's a very, very key part of the portfolio. We look forward to highlighting it more. The client portfolio has always been a strength of the business. It's something that's been built over the last several years. We've driven several innovations in that, like the DRAM-less client SSD. That's always been a very strong part of the portfolio. I guess, you know, Mehdi, we could have put a whole bunch of stuff on the slide that we're proud of in the portfolio, but we picked the strongest ones. But we're very bullish on the enterprise SSD market. It's just a market that's depressed right now. We talked a lot about that last year. We had qualifications at multiple hyperscalers. Those products are still active. We're migrating them forward to future nodes and we expect those to ramp as that market recovers.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, great. And just a question, a follow-up question for Wissam, and I'm not asking you for a guide on 2024, but if I just look at your cost decline, if I just assume 10% the cost decline and assume the current ASP trend, your NAND flash business should become profitable maybe by mid-year or sooner than later. The trajectory is very supportive of reaching profitability in the next couple of quarters. Is that a fair assumption?\nWissam Jabre: Well, look, what -- in the current guide for this quarter, it does imply that NAND should be gross margin positive. And in terms of the outer quarters, it's a little bit too early for us to comment on them.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Mehdi.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the announcement.\nDavid Goeckeler: Thanks, Toshiya.\nToshiya Hari: Yes, Dave. So, on the NAND side, I think based on a response to a prior question. It looks like you're assuming underutilization charges declined by about $60 million from September to December. Are you guys taking up wafer starts, or what's driving the sequential decline in charges in NAND?\nDavid Goeckeler: Yeah, I guess what I -- Wissam will comment a little bit as well, but I guess what I would say Toshiya is we're, you know, we're not putting a broad statement out there about that. What we're doing is just being very dynamic with how we manage wafer start so that we can keep supply and demand matched as best we can without letting inventory get up too high. So as you saw, I mean, our NAND inventory is at the best level since I've been here in the company. I mean, Wissam's team has done a great, and the operations team just done an unbelievable job of managing that. So we'll stay very close to where our markets are and how we're seeing demand, and then we'll adjust wafer starts appropriately.\nWissam Jabre: Yes, thanks, Dave. The only thing I would add, Toshiya, is that when you think of underutilization just I know there was an earlier question on this. Yes, we do expect underutilization further in the second-half of fiscal year. The way to think of it as we were expecting underutilization to be slightly lower from these levels in the third fiscal quarter. And as David said, this is very dynamic. We continue to manage the business on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. And so obviously, depending on business conditions, this could still change.\nToshiya Hari: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, David, you talked about value-based pricing on the hard disk drive side and how that's driving better gross margins into the December quarter. Can you speak to any kind of specific end markets where you're seeing traction? Is it mostly client and consumer? Are you able to push through some price increases in the cloud segment as well? Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: I think it's, so first of all on the channel, we're seeing good response to value-based pricing. And then as we bring out new products, you know, as I said in the past, I think innovation is what the first part of value-based pricing is bringing a better value proposition to our customers. And as we continue to bring out unique products 26 terabyte ultra-SMR ramped very fast, nearly half of our nearline exabytes this quarter, and we're now bringing out 28. And I think as we continue to do that, we'll have the opportunity to have a better conversation with our customers, because we're bringing more value to them. So I would say it's, we're looking at it across all of our markets.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you.\nDavid Goeckeler: All right. Hey, thank you, Toshiya. We appreciate that. All right, everybody, we appreciate the time today. Thanks for the discussion, and we look forward to talking to you as we progress throughout the quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goeckeler",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I will first discuss the completion of the strategic review and then turn to our first quarter results. We're thrilled to announce the completion of our strategic review and plans to form two independent public companies focused on capitalizing on the data storage industry's growth in HDD and flash. After evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives, the Western Digital management team and Board determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. This transaction will allow each franchise to execute on its product and innovation roadmap and capitalize on the unique growth opportunities in their respective end markets. Each company will benefit from streamlined management focus, operational flexibility, and the ability to set its own distinct capital allocation and shareholder return policies. We are excited for the opportunities this transaction creates to better serve our customers, support our suppliers, partners, and employees, and unlock significant value for our shareholders. Before discussing the details, let me walk you through the journey that brought us to this point. In March 2020, I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the company's unique position to accelerate and benefit from the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company, and how all of us live our daily lives. And importantly, I saw an opportunity to create value for a leader in both NAND flash and hard drives. During my early days at the company, I spent considerable energy into rebuilding and refocusing the company, including the formation of the HDD and flash business units. It soon became clear that our focus on driving two distinct technology portfolios was the right strategy, and the new management team that I brought and worked together to transform Western Digital by bolstering business agility and reinvigorating innovation. In addition, we promptly focused on strengthening our balance sheet. We made the tough decision to suspend our dividend, which allowed Western Digital to speed up debt reduction and paid down $2.7 billion of debt over a couple of years following the suspension. We further enhanced our liquidity by bringing in $900 million of strategic investment from Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management and amended our credit agreements. We also settled a long-standing tax dispute to increase strategic optionality. The groundwork we laid over the past several years, including the additional actions taken in fiscal year \u201823 to right-size the business, have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment, all while staying focused on delivering a range of industry-leading products. Each business is now in a strong operational position to succeed on its own and the actions we are announcing today will further enable each company to drive long-term success in the years to come. The Western Digital team and Board completed the strategic review after evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives and determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. During our strategic review process, we evaluated material opportunities for each of our businesses. However, given current constraints, it has become clearer to the board in recent weeks that delivering a standalone separation is the right next step in the evolution of Western Digital and puts the company in the best position to unlock value for our shareholders, while providing strategic optionality for both businesses. Given the confidential nature of the strategic review, we will not be discussing any of the other alternatives that were considered during the process. On page six of the presentation, we present a separation transaction summary. The HDD business will retain the Western Digital name and become an independent publicly traded company. The flash business is expected to be spun-off in a tax-free transaction to Western Digital shareholders, and the name of the publicly traded company will be determined at a later time. We target to complete these plans in the second-half of calendar year \u201824, subject to the principal closing conditions described in the slide. Page seven provides a bit more visibility into some of the end market exposure for our flash and HDD businesses on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving to the individual businesses on page eight. In HDD, Western Digital is a well-known leader in the mass storage market with an ability to generate consistent cash flow on a standalone basis. Our ability to lead the industry in bringing new innovations to the hard drive market to enable higher capacity points for mass market adoption has established Western Digital as a key strategic supplier to the world's global cloud service providers, storage OEM, and distributors. The massive opportunity is driven by the ongoing expansion of the cloud infrastructure, connected to intelligent endpoints and powered by high-speed networks. Industry analysts estimate the HDD addressable market to grow at approximately 12% compounded annual growth rate to $25 billion over the next three years with cloud representing over 90% of the total addressable market. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital and we are well positioned to address customer storage needs. Moving to our flash business on page 10. The Western Digital flash business is well-known for its broad go-to-market channels, enviable premium brand retail franchise, and strong client SSD portfolio. Industry analysts forecast the flash market to grow at approximately 15% compounded annual growth rate over the next three years to $89 billion in calendar year 2025. We believe content increases in the consumer and client end markets, as well as explosive growth of data created in the cloud by emerging applications such as generative AI, virtual reality, and autonomous driving, are driving a faster growth in flash versus HDD. The highlight of our consumer end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and our suite of high-performance SSDs for gaming enthusiasts. The brand recognition and affinity, combined with our unmatched presence across the world, is a great setup for the business on a standalone basis. Our successful 23-year partnership with Kioxia continues to provide us a reliable source of high-performance, low-cost flash. Together, we have successfully brought to market numerous generations of flash technology with the industry's lowest cost and best capital efficiency. The joint venture fabs produce over 30% of the world's bits and our joint memory technology roadmap remains incredibly well positioned especially as we lead the industry's transition to wafer bonding. We will likely host an investor day closer to the time of the spin-off of our flash business to give investors greater clarity into the historical and future outlook for each of our businesses, along with the intended capital structures for each business. With that, I'd like to turn to first quarter fiscal \u201824 earnings review and business update. Western Digital's first quarter results exceeded our expectations as the team's efforts to bolster a business agility, drive innovation, and right-size the business have enabled us to capitalize on enhanced earning power in an improving environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $2.75 billion and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.76. Our ability to develop differentiated and innovative products across a broad range of end markets has resulted in sequential margin improvement across both flash and HDD businesses. In flash, healthy inventory levels on our balance sheet and signs that flash pricing is beginning to inflect have laid the groundwork for further gross margin improvements. Our broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise, and strong client SSD portfolio have enabled us to shift bits to the most attractive end market categories and achieve 26% sequential bit growth, as well as upside and gross margin. In HDD, our industry leading 26 terabyte ultra-SMR drive became the highest near-line volume runner in just two quarters, which demonstrates Western Digital's aerial density leadership and ability to deliver high volume innovative technologies to data center customers worldwide. During the quarter, demand in consumer and client continued to improve, exceeding our expectations. In consumer, flash revenue has returned to growth on a year-over-year basis, led by strong content increases and unit growth. In client, PC and component demand also exceeded our expectations, and demand for gaming consoles and mobile remained resilient. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remains subdued. I'll now turn to the business updates starting with flash. During the quarter, flash revenue increased sequentially, led by record exabyte shipments and continued content growth in consumer and client end markets, including PCs and all retail products, as we continue to optimize bit placement in an improving environment. WD Black, which is optimized for gaming, continued to perform well, with bits shipments more than doubling and content per unit increasing over 50% year-over-year. We are in an excellent position from both of flash technology and capital efficiency perspective. Today, a majority of products we are shipping are based on BiCS5, the most capital efficient node in the 3D era that continues to provide an amazing cost structure and efficient capital spending. As we look into calendar year \u201824, we are ramping an array of QLC-based client SSDs based on BiCS6 technology to lead the expected industry transition to QLC. After BiCS6, we remain on track to introduce a broad range of high performance products based on BiCS8 technology with its unique chip bonded on array architecture. Turning to HDD, revenue declined due to lower nearline exabyte shipments driven by subdued demand from our cloud customers and slower-than-expected recovery in China. However, demand for consumer and client hard drives was stable. Western Digital has continued to lead the industry in driving innovation within the nearline market. Our ability to bring innovation into mass market drives that are quickly deployed into cloud data centers is reflected in our results as we successfully led the industry's transition to SMR-based nearline drives. Specifically, our 26 terabyte ultra-SMR drive, which we first announced at our investor day, accounted for nearly half of our nearline exabyte shipments with total SMR shipments exceeding the 40% goal we laid out in the same quarter a year prior. We are on track with our 28 terabyte ultra-SMR drive qualification and have a clear roadmap of EPMR and ultra-SMR based innovations into the 40 terabyte range. These developments are a result of the choices we have made in the past few years through a combination of product R&D and manufacturing capabilities, and we are proud of how we have been executing against our strategy. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, in flash we expect both modest bit and ASP improvement and a decline in underutilization charges to drive continued sequential improvement in both revenue and gross margin. In HDD, we expect higher nearline shipments and seasonal demand in consumer end market to drive sequential revenue growth. We anticipate our value-based pricing efforts and lower underutilization charges will lead to sequential revenue and gross margin improvement in the quarter and through the rest of fiscal year \u201824. As we continue to execute against our HDD product roadmap, we are setting the stage for profitable growth for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam. Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions. We are now emerging from a historic storage cyclical downturn, where all of the changes made in the past several years were evident in how well each business performed relative to peers. The first quarter of fiscal \u201824 builds upon the improvements we made in fiscal year \u201823 around discipline, supply, and capital expenditure management, while executing on our product innovation roadmap. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses and are closely monitoring demand in our end markets to appropriately manage our inventory in both flash and HDD, all to improve sequential and year-over-year upside in our results. Moving forward, as we progress through fiscal year \u201824, we see an improving market environment in both businesses. With an improved position, the separation of the company unlocks value by creating two independent public companies with market-specific strategic focus. Better positions each franchise to execute innovative technology and product development, capitalize on unique growth opportunities, extend respective leadership positions, and operate more efficiently with distinct capital structures. Okay, Peter, let's open up for Q&A. Hey Joe, this is David. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you this morning. One thing I will say is we're very happy with the level of efficiency we've driven into the business over the last year, especially during this downturn, and we think has put us in a very good position to go through this transaction. I think OpEx over two years is down, over the last two years is down over $200 million. So we put ourselves in a position where we've got very efficient business and some flexibility to go through a transaction like this. So as Wissam said, we'll have more to say as we get closer. No. So first off, the relationship with Kioxia is outstanding and it has been for a very, very long time so we expect that to continue on absolutely it's a -- provides a tremendous foundation for our NAND business with both very capital efficient NAND and a tremendous roadmap as we're going into BiCS8 here. But we can execute this transaction without any other approvals. Yes, we think this past quarter was the bottom, Aaron, and we see improving demand as we move throughout the fiscal year on a quarter-over-quarter basis. You know, we've had certain customers that have been on the sidelines for a while, and they're starting to come back and give us visibility into ordering. So we expect the market to recover from here going forward. So there's no, the separation doesn't imply any change in strategy for either business. So both of them will continue to go forward. No change in our product roadmaps. We feel very good about what's been built over the last three, four years. We feel like we're in a market-leading position in both franchises, both from a product point of view, if you look at what's happened in the hard drive business, you know, it's very, very clear now the adoption of SMR is the next big step in the cloud data center and that's progressing very well. Our 26-T drive just became the highest shipping drive in the quarter. And we, you know, we announced the next generation that with the 28-T, as well so no change there, you know, OptiNAND still a big part of that architecture and the team will be able to procure that and continue to drive that part of the strategy. And on the flash side of the business, the portfolio is also in great shape with both for product strategy and also the branding strategy. SanDisk, WD Black, these brands continue to perform extremely well. So we think it's a great setup for both businesses going forward. Well, look we put a lot of optionality in our roadmap a number of years ago, so that we could extend the capacity points with things like OptiNAND, SMR, Ultra-SMR, EPMR, so that strategy is working very, very well. We're leading the industry in capacity points. We expect to be able to drive this strategy into the 40 terabyte range on our drives. HAMR is in development, it's going well, and we'll be able to fold that into our roadmap at the appropriate time. But for now, we've got a great roadmap, we've got a market-leading roadmap, we're leading the adoption of SMR into the cloud data center and we expect, you know, we have many more generations to go on our current roadmap and then we'll move to HAMR at the appropriate time when it's mature and we can build it at scale and it'll be the next leg of growth into the future. Thank you, Krish. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Yes, Sidney, I guess, what I would add is, if you look at the HDD business, we're ramping new products, right? The 26-T drive is ramping rapidly. And we also have an improving pricing environment in drives, which is a nice tailwind. And then in flash, we have an improving pricing environment as well, as Wissam said, a better mix. And we expect that business to inflect a positive gross margin next quarter, which is a great milestone for us as we continue the recovery of the business. Yes, so, you know, we have seen an acceleration here at the end of \u201823. We've raised our demand number quite a bit into the mid-teens for '23, we'll get to \u201824. You know, some of that, you know, there has been some strategic buys as part of that. I know that's been a big discussion in the industry, but we'd also just see the markets returning to normal inventory levels. So for us, that's been more of what's been happening and a good mix across the businesses. For \u201824 we see high-teens, kind of, demand and we continue to see production significantly below that. Yes, I think you got it there in your question. I think you have more broad-based participation in the market by the big hyperscalers as they get to the end of their inventory corrections. So that's been part of it. Remember, we're coming off very, very, very low numbers. So we expect improvement throughout the year by more people participating in the market and more consistent participation by the ones that have been in it on a quarter-over-quarter basis. China has been -- it's been better, but not -- it hasn't recovered as fast as we expected, so it's still a little bit lumpy and weaker than we would like. So the smart video market has been pretty consistent and we've seen some good results there. But in the cloud space, it still has a little ways to go. Good morning, Karl. Yes, I'll take the second part of that, and Wissam can comment on the underutilization charges. Look, we expect bits to be up slightly in the December quarter. It's a strong consumer quarter for us, although we don't really break out by mix. But I mean, I think that's one way to think about it. We expect an improving price environment and bits to be slightly up. No, it's not in reference to any particular thing. It just says that we think this is the best next step for the business to unlock value. We think that, you know, we put the business in a position to go through this right now. It's all the reasons we talked about from the portfolio to where we are on efficiency point of view to where we are on the work we've done to retire debt. And also going into an improving market. But I think any company is always open to other strategic options should they become available and we'll consider them at that time. Although I do want to be very clear that the strategic review is completed and any conversations that were going on as a part of that have ended. And we're very excited about this step forward. We think it's the best next step for the business. But I think in any business, you're always going to be open. If there's other strategic options that become available, we will thoroughly consider those at the time. So yes, we, I mean, coming off such a high on \u201822, \u201823 will be down, but then we expect to get back to, we expect a consistent exabyte growth in this business in the mid to high-20 range on an ongoing basis. Yes, no, we don't expect any change in the technology roadmap. The JV is very strong, very solid, very productive. Teams work together on a day-by-day basis. We've talked a lot about that. We're very happy with where it's at. The relationship is very strong. The technology roadmap, we think, as we talked about last time with BiCS8 and wafer bonding, we've made a huge step forward there. You know, we've always been able to produce NAND at a better capital intensity than the rest of the industry. Our measures over the last several years are up to a third less capital intensity for the business. So the JV has been strong for \u201823 plus years and we expect it to be strong for very, very far into the future. So we feel very good about that. Yes, we expect demand in \u201824 in the NAND business to be high-teens, you know, and if it gets really strong maybe it'll creep over the 20s and low-20s, but we're thinking about those high teens numbers. And like I said, production will be significantly below that. Good morning, Harlan. Yes, we do. We feel very good about that. I mean, I've spoken about this in the past. It's an explicit goal of the technology team to continue to drive those cost downs and we feel good about our ability to do that. It's been one of the strengths of the JV and the JV technology team for a very long time. Well, we like the portfolio we have. We qualified our NVMe based enterprise SSD at multiple cloud providers. And unfortunately, we qualified right into a significant downturn in cloud consumption of enterprise SSDs. So as that starts to come back over the next several quarters and as we go through \u201824, we expect our position to improve as those vendors start consuming again. I mean, the reality is there's just not a lot of buying in that market going on right now. Thank you. Well, I mean, it's because those are two very, very strong strengths of the portfolio. I think they're very unique. Look, our retail franchise is a real gem. I mean, it's a big part of the portfolio. It provides better through cycle profitability. We've done a lot of work on building brands over the last several years. I mean, we've already had very, very strong brands in SanDisk. I think everybody knows SanDisk is the premier brand in the industry. We've built the BLACK brand around gaming now. That's a significant part of the portfolio. I think we're the preferred provider in gaming. We talked about it this quarter, where 50% year-over-year content increases in devices and doubling the number of bits in that. So it's been, you know, it's a very, very key part of the portfolio. We look forward to highlighting it more. The client portfolio has always been a strength of the business. It's something that's been built over the last several years. We've driven several innovations in that, like the DRAM-less client SSD. That's always been a very strong part of the portfolio. I guess, you know, Mehdi, we could have put a whole bunch of stuff on the slide that we're proud of in the portfolio, but we picked the strongest ones. But we're very bullish on the enterprise SSD market. It's just a market that's depressed right now. We talked a lot about that last year. We had qualifications at multiple hyperscalers. Those products are still active. We're migrating them forward to future nodes and we expect those to ramp as that market recovers. Thanks, Mehdi. Thanks, Toshiya. Yeah, I guess what I -- Wissam will comment a little bit as well, but I guess what I would say Toshiya is we're, you know, we're not putting a broad statement out there about that. What we're doing is just being very dynamic with how we manage wafer start so that we can keep supply and demand matched as best we can without letting inventory get up too high. So as you saw, I mean, our NAND inventory is at the best level since I've been here in the company. I mean, Wissam's team has done a great, and the operations team just done an unbelievable job of managing that. So we'll stay very close to where our markets are and how we're seeing demand, and then we'll adjust wafer starts appropriately. I think it's, so first of all on the channel, we're seeing good response to value-based pricing. And then as we bring out new products, you know, as I said in the past, I think innovation is what the first part of value-based pricing is bringing a better value proposition to our customers. And as we continue to bring out unique products 26 terabyte ultra-SMR ramped very fast, nearly half of our nearline exabytes this quarter, and we're now bringing out 28. And I think as we continue to do that, we'll have the opportunity to have a better conversation with our customers, because we're bringing more value to them. So I would say it's, we're looking at it across all of our markets. All right. Hey, thank you, Toshiya. We appreciate that. All right, everybody, we appreciate the time today. Thanks for the discussion, and we look forward to talking to you as we progress throughout the quarter."

            "content": "Thank you and good morning everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal first quarter results exceeded the guidance ranges provided in July. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.75 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.76. Looking at end markets for the fiscal first quarter, cloud represented 32% of total revenue at $0.9 billion, down 12% sequentially, and 52% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to lower nearline hard drive shipments to data center customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in shipments for both hard drive and flash products. Client represented 42% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 11% sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was due to growth in flash-bit shipments. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in flash pricing. Consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.7 billion, up 14% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by both higher content per unit and increased unit shipments in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal first quarter, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 13% sequentially, and down 10% year-over-year. This marks the second consecutive quarter of sequential increase. Sequentially, flash ASPs decreased 10% on a blended basis, and 4% on a like-for-like basis. We shipped a record amount of flash bits in the quarter with shipments increasing 26%, sequentially and 49% year-over-year. HDD revenue was $1.2 billion, down 8% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 5%, and average price per unit increased 13% to $112. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 42% and average price per unit decreased 10%. Moving to gross margin and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 4.1%, which was at the higher end of the guidance range provided in July, and included $225 million in underutilization expenses and $9 million in other one-time charges. In total, these charges represented an 8.5 percentage point headwind to gross margin. Flash gross margin was negative 10.3%. Underutilization charges due to reduced manufacturing volumes were $142 million and flash inventory write-downs were $9 million, resulting in a combined 9.7 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 22.9%. Underutilization charges were higher-than-expected at $83 million or a 7 percentage point headwind to gross margin. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were down 19% year-over-year to $555 million, well below our guidance range. Operating loss was $443 million, which included underutilization charges and inventory write-downs totaling $234 million. Income tax expense in the fiscal first quarter was $25 million. Net loss per share was $1.76, inclusive of a $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was an outflow of $626 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $544 million. Free cash flow included a payment of $523 million for the IRS settlement and $191 million cash receipt from the sale and lease back of our facility in Milpitas, California. Inventory declined $201 million sequentially to $3.5 billion. Days of inventory declined 10 days to 120 days. Flash inventory declined by nearly $400 million, driven by record bit shipments in the quarter and proactive actions taken to reduce wafer starts. Days of inventory for flash have reached the lowest level in nearly four years. HDD inventory grew by nearly $200 million, due to the timing of certain purchases and lower-than-expected shipments. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment, including the proceeds from our sale lease back of our Milpitas facility, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement, represented a net cash inflow of $82 million. In the fiscal first quarter, we fully drew the $600 million delayed-draft term loan facility. Gross debt outstanding was $7.7 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $4.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. For fiscal second quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be led by higher nearline HDD shipments and improved pricing in flash. We continue to adjust production into the second quarter to better align supply with demand and anticipate lower underutilization charges in both flash and HDD. For our fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 10% and 12%, which includes underutilization charges across flash and HDD, totaling $110 million to $130 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $560 million and $580 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal second quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect a loss per share of $1.35 to $1.05, assuming approximately 325 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David. Hey, Joe, good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, it's a little bit too premature to talk about details with respect to each side of the business or each company as we get closer to the separation will be in a better position to talk about much more details with respect to OpEx apportionment, as well as capital structures, leverage targets, and capital return policies, et cetera. Yes, Joe, the current announcement does not affect our ability to address the convert. As we've said before, our plan is to address the convert that's maturing in Feb \u201824 by the end of this calendar year. You're welcome. Okay. So, on the first one, yes, I mean, Wamsi, I think you kind of laid it out there. We've been going through a whole series of actions that have set us up for this announcement. You know, it was really about execute the business better and give ourselves as much strategic optionality as possible. So as I talked about in the prepared remarks we've, you know, we separated ourselves in the business units on the product side that allows us to really get very focused on the portfolio and all the OpEx we spend on building our products, make sure we get the best return for it. I think that's worked out well. We then did the same thing in operations. We've now divided those organizations around HDD and flash. So we've -- and then we've optimized, taken out cost everywhere we can so that we can operate them independently and also have just the most efficient business possible. As I said, we've focused on our balance sheet. So I think we've put ourselves in a very good position where we can go through this separation and the organization is as prepared as we possibly can be for it. We've also, as I said earlier, we've taken a lot of OpEx out of the business. So we've driven the OpEx down to a very efficient number. So we believe we can go through the separation and end up with two very well-structured companies that can execute very well. And they come out of the gate with market-leading portfolios on each side and into a recovering market. So we feel good about that. Cost of the portfolio look I mean as you continue we feel the roadmap we have in place, you know, we can produce ultra-SMR, EPMR, OptiNAND drives very high scale, very quickly, very high yields on all the products. So we think the cost position is very advantageous. You see that in our results, you know, so you know when HAMR comes will fold that in and you know we want to get to the point where we have the same level of yields we have the same level of confidence as we do something like a 26-T drive that we just launched and now it's the, you know, nearly half of our exabytes, a quarter or two in. And that's how we think about launching new products. So you know, when we get there, I think that we'll have that same kind of cost structure on HAMR, and we have a great, very, very strong position to drive very efficient, very high scale, very quickly, new drives for many generations on the technology that we've put in place over the last three or four years. Yes. Good morning, Sidney. Thanks for the question. The current announcement does not affect the amended credit agreements. And so from a free cash flow, from a governance perspective, we're comfortable that we can operate effectively. We have ample liquidity. We do have ample operational flexibility to operate, so I don't see the current announcement as impacting us in any way. Okay, maybe I'll start a little bit on the cost side and then David could chime in on the top line side. Look, the -- when -- one of the bigger, obviously, levers is the underutilization. We did in Q1, around $225 million. In total, we had around $234 million to 235 million of other charges. And our guide has a underutilization at a much lower level, and so that's one element. In addition, obviously, we continue to focus on cost reduction. We do have still, we're still, if you exclude the underutilization aspect, we're still taking cost out of the system on both the flash side and the HDD side. And so that's a key lever to improve the gross margin. And then if I take it back up to the top line, we see obviously improvement on the revenue side and the improvement is coming from both sides of the house on both businesses. So that also contributes quite well with respect to the gross margin and within that revenue also we do have a bit of a mix that's helping us as well. Divergence in what aspect, Tom? So we're managing the business for profitability on HDD. I mean, I think it's, you know, we and I think we are driving a more profitable business. So that, that's the way we think about the business and driving back to our model, which we expect to get back to here over the next several quarters. Jamie? Yes, sure. So on the tax payment, in Q1 we made a $523 million payment with respect to the IRS settlement. This covers the years 2008 through 2012. And so this is why you see when you look at our free cash flow that we reported for fiscal Q1 at a negative $544 million, in that we had that $523 million payment. On the -- it was partially offset by the sale and lease back of the Milpitas facilities of around $191 million. So all in all, we're around the negative $200 million for the quarter. As we look forward, obviously, the key is the continuous improvement of the profitability and of the business, working capital management. You've seen our transition on the inventory side, for instance, in Q1. We continue to manage inventory very, very closely on both flash and HDD. So I expect that inventory to continue to decline gradually in this coming quarter and the next. And then the continued focus on CapEx for the fiscal year. Would it say that for fiscal \u201824 we expect our cash CapEx to be significantly lower than fiscal 2023. So, you know, free cash flow is, and cash flow is very important to us, big focus, and we'll continue to focus on it. And as we look into the second-half of fiscal \u201824, we're projecting to be cash flow positive on a quarterly basis in the second-half of this fiscal year. Yes, and with respect to underutilization, Karl, we do manage our supply very dynamically. And so we guided this quarter based on what we see today. We do expect underutilization to continue in the third fiscal quarter, maybe a little bit lower than here, but it's a bit too early to cover the quarters beyond the next one. Yes, the split of the underage utilization is two-thirds flash and one-third HDD. You're welcome. Well, look, what -- in the current guide for this quarter, it does imply that NAND should be gross margin positive. And in terms of the outer quarters, it's a little bit too early for us to comment on them. Yes, thanks, Dave. The only thing I would add, Toshiya, is that when you think of underutilization just I know there was an earlier question on this. Yes, we do expect underutilization further in the second-half of fiscal year. The way to think of it as we were expecting underutilization to be slightly lower from these levels in the third fiscal quarter. And as David said, this is very dynamic. We continue to manage the business on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. And so obviously, depending on business conditions, this could still change."
