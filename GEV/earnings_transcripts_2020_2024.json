My name is Liz [ph] and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nMichael Lapides: Thank you. Welcome to GE Vernova's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik; and CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's Form 10-Q, press release and in the presentation slides, all of which are available on our website. Please note that year-over-year commentary or variances on orders, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margin discussed during our prepared remarks are on an organic basis. We will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we do not undertake any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainty. With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We continue to gain confidence and conviction in the growth trajectory ahead for GE Vernova. We are in the early innings of an investment super cycle in the expansion and decarbonization of the electric power system driven by increasing demand for power, increased focus on energy security and rising grid investments. The GE Vernova purpose has never been more clear and we are excited to have published our first sustainability report last month. Our objective with this report is to provide metrics on our progress in electrifying and decarbonizing the world while ensuring the communities we operate in thrive and simultaneously get better each year in conserving resources with our own operations. A quick discussion on a few of the sustainability metrics we'll measure and update each year. In 2023, we added 29 gigawatts of new capacity to the grid globally with 42% in developing markets. The carbon intensity of this capacity is approximately 25% below the global average carbon intensity of the existing global power sector and has the potential to avoid 20 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year. I share these examples to reinforce our true north in both adding capacity to the grid each year while driving towards a more sustainable electricity system. These sustainability metrics align our broader purpose with our multiyear financial ambitions to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 4. I will spend a few minutes on each of our segments. Our Power segment led by Gas Power delivered strong double-digit orders and revenue growth with over 200 basis points of margin expansion. Power orders increased 34% this quarter, driven by substantial equipment demand both for HA and aeroderivative units as well as services. Year-to-date, we have booked approximately 14 gigawatts of orders for new gas turbines, nearly double last year's level. We expect the fourth quarter to be our largest equipment orders quarter of 2024. As discussed in September, we have now secured capacity to deliver between 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year starting in 2026, up from 55 in recent years. As we look at the anticipated orders profile for 2026 and 2027, even with this capacity expansion, manufacturing slots are scarce. In addition to equipment demand growth, we are seeing services demand in our installed base grow meaningfully. As customers aim to get more capacity and better performance out of their plants, we expect greater demand for upgrades, driving gas services growth. Today, we deliver about $2 billion of upgrades annually in our gas business and we anticipate this could grow by 50% by the end of the decade. There is a lot to be excited about in our Power segment. Electrification is our fastest-growing segment, delivering a 24% revenue increase in the quarter, driven by stronger volume and price. Demand for our products remain strong as customers modernize and invest in critical grid products, such as HVDC systems, transformers and switchgears which are essential to ensuring a reliable electricity system and connecting new generation sources. Over the last 2 years, we have seen our equipment backlog grow meaningfully and profitably and we are on track to more than triple this backlog by year-end '24 from year-end '22 levels of just over $6 billion. This quarter, electrification achieved double-digit EBITDA margin for the first time with expansion of nearly 700 basis points. Demand trends and improving execution are driving an acceleration in margin expansion, increasing our confidence in our trajectory going forward and we expect this business to consistently deliver double-digit EBITDA margins from here. Turning to Wind. In onshore, we continue to improve on our profitability, expanding margins and delivering our most profitable quarter in a number of years. We remain cautious on the timing of the inflection for orders but have positioned this business to deliver high single-digit EBITDA margins on approximately flat revenue this year. We continue to have confidence that as we drive onshore revenue growth, as early as 2026, we can continue to accrete margins in this business. In offshore, we've had a difficult 4 months and are disappointed given the impact on our customers and on our financial results with a significant loss we took this quarter. We have finalized root cause analysis and confirmed the blade issue at Vineyard Wind was caused by a manufacturing deviation from our factory in Canada. We have been very intentional, thorough, not rushed in re-evaluating our blade quality across offshore wind in totality. As we reaccelerate progress on our projects, we are proactively strengthening some of the blades, either back at the factory or in the field to improve quality and readiness for their intended useful life. We continue installing turbines in Dogger Bank, while at Vineyard Wind; we are installing towers and the cells and are very close to resuming blade installation. Looking ahead, we're focused on improving execution and delivering on the approximately $3 billion backlog in the safest, highest quality delivery model that makes economic sense for our customers and ourselves. We do not foresee adding to this backlog without substantially different industry economics than what we see in the marketplace today. I'm proud of our team as they execute in this difficult environment and appreciate the engagement with our customers. I remain confident that we will return the Wind segment to profitability in the fourth quarter. Now over to the right side of the page. We're focused on further embedding lean across the organization, driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery and cost. Safety is our number one priority. And unfortunately, we experienced a fatality this quarter in an onshore wind site in Sweden. We are working to accelerate the company-wide adoption of our lifesaving rules deployed earlier this summer. Turning to quality; an example of how we are implementing lean in our onshore wind business is our workhorse turbine strategy. Today, we have over 2,000 of our workhorse 2.8-megawatt wind turbines that we've commissioned in the last 2 years. These units are performing at approximately 98% availability due to our focus on reduced variance and repeatable operations to drive better quality. On delivery, we are leveraging lean to increase output of our existing manufacturing footprint with limited capital spend needed. As an example, in our power transmission business within grid, we will double the capacity of the manufacturing output of this business, with 75% of the expansion coming from core lean improvements driven by better asset and labor utilization. The remaining 25% of the capacity increase will come from site expansions. On cost, we announced a planned reduction in our offshore wind headcount as part of our efforts to streamline our wind business to make it more efficient and to improve results. We are operating the Wind segment as 1 global business with 3 main product lines, 2 in onshore wind and 1 in offshore wind, with increased visibility, improved learnings across the teams and a better cost structure. We are also driving meaningful productivity with our suppliers in the large electrification projects that we have secured in backlog in the last 21 months. This progress continues to strengthen our confidence in our ability to deliver this growing backlog in electrification for our customers while substantially accreting margins in this business going forward. Turning to the next slide for a look into our third quarter financial performance. We delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders with services up almost 30% and double-digit revenue growth as well as significant margin expansion at power, electrification and onshore wind. That said, our quarter could have been even stronger if not for the quality and execution challenges in offshore wind which we are addressing and learning from to make us a stronger company going forward. We generated substantial free cash flow and increased our cash balance from $5.8 billion in 2Q to $7.4 billion in 3Q. During the quarter, we sold a 16% ownership stake in GE Vernova T&D India, part of the Electrification segment at an attractive valuation that generated approximately $700 million of pre-tax proceeds. This transaction demonstrates how we intend to run GE Vernova. We will monetize assets across our portfolio when we see attractive opportunities to do so, enabling us to invest more in our core businesses to simplify the company and return capital to our shareholders. We are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance. We look forward to discussing our multiyear financial outlook as well as our capital allocation strategy at our Investor Update in New York on December 10. I'm more confident today in the future of our business than ever. And I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our third quarter performance.\nKen Parks: Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 6. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with double-digit orders and revenue growth led by Power and Electrification. Margins expanded year-over-year across power, electrification and onshore wind but were offset primarily due to additional contract losses at offshore wind. Importantly, we generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter driven by strong working capital management, including improved linearity. Orders grew 17%, driven by services which increased 28% with double-digit growth across all 3 segments. Equipment orders grew approximately 8%. Power and electrification equipment orders grew substantially, partially offset by lower equipment orders at wind. Our backlog of $118 billion grew both year-over-year and sequentially and equipment margin and backlog remains healthy, reflecting our disciplined profitable growth priority. Revenue increased 10% in both equipment and services. Service revenue grew in all 3 segments, while continued momentum in Electrification and Power drove higher equipment revenue. In addition, price remained positive across all 3 segments. Adjusted EBITDA continued to reflect higher, more profitable volume, price and productivity in the quarter. On an organic basis, Electrification realized nearly 700 basis points of margin expansion and Power margins expanded more than 200 basis points. This margin strength was offset by Wind, primarily due to higher contract losses at offshore. We delivered nearly $1 billion of positive free cash flow improving $900 million year-over-year, primarily driven by stronger working capital management. Working capital was an approximately $600 million benefit in the quarter improving over $500 million year-over-year, mainly due to improved linearity which includes more closely aligning the timing of disbursements and collections. Our cash balance also reflects the monetization of a 16% ownership stake in our electrification joint venture in India which generated approximately $700 million of pre-tax proceeds classified as financing cash flows with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. We executed this transaction as a part of our ongoing process to simplify entity shareholding structures as well as to capitalize on strong equity valuations in India, while remaining the majority shareholder in this business, serving an attractive market. Combined with our third quarter free cash flow, these proceeds increased our already solid cash balance to $7.4 billion. We're encouraged by our year-to-date financial performance with solid revenue growth led by services which increased 9% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 200 basis points and more than $1.1 billion of positive free cash flow generation, a year-over-year improvement of over $2 billion. Our backlog growth in both services and equipment provides an excellent foundation for continued strong financial performance. Turning to Power on Slide 7. The segment delivered another strong quarter with continued double-digit orders growth, increasing revenue and further EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 34%, led by higher equipment and services at Gas Power. Gas Power equipment orders increased 40% as we booked 9 HA units in the quarter which exceeded the total number of HAs booked in all of 2023. We also booked 15 aeroderivative units in the quarter, almost doubling units ordered in the third quarter of last year. Power services orders were up 29% due to higher demand from outages and upgrades. The robust demand for gas equipment and services is driving further growth in our backlog. Based upon the backlog, we're funding capacity expansion from customer orders and related down payments to enable delivery of 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines annually starting in 2026. Revenue grew 13%, driven by Gas Power. Services increased mainly from higher outage volume as well as price. Equipment revenue reflected growth in HA gas turbine deliveries. EBITDA increased 45%, resulting in 240 basis points of margin expansion as higher volume, productivity and price more than offset the impact of inflation. We're using lean to drive better operational execution and productivity which is improving equipment profitability. For example, the heavy-duty gas turbine team enhanced standard work from underwriting to execution through a series of kaizens. This work has resulted in a 20% improvement in quality control so far this year, generating productivity and margin expansion. We continue to leverage lean to drive better financial results and better outcomes for our customers. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect gas equipment orders to accelerate. We anticipate higher HA deliveries and services revenue to be offset by lower aeroderivative deliveries, resulting in relatively flat revenue, EBITDA and margin compared to a strong 4Q '23. We also expect continued productivity to offset inflation. At Wind, onshore delivered its most profitable results in 12 quarters, while we incurred additional offshore contract losses related to the impacts of recent blade events and expected project execution delays. Wind orders declined 19% due to lower onshore equipment orders outside of North America as we remain selective about the markets we serve. In offshore, we remain focused on executing our existing challenged backlog. Revenue decreased slightly in the quarter. In offshore, the impact of execution delays resulted in lower revenue, partially offset by a settlement of approximately $500 million for a previously cancelled offshore project. In onshore, revenue grew due to higher North America equipment and services despite lower volume outside of North America. EBITDA margins contracted 410 basis points versus the prior year. In offshore, the impact of the approximately $700 million charge for additional contract losses was partially offset by the $300 million gain from the offshore project cancellation settlement. In onshore, margins expanded from positive price and favorable equipment mix. Onshore delivered better results despite higher services costs as we're deploying more crews and cranes to continue improving fleet availability. Overall, we're focused on driving better quality, cost and execution productivity across wind. As discussed, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers navigate growing interconnection queues. We do expect the Wind segment to grow revenue and EBITDA substantially in the fourth quarter as we deliver more higher-margin onshore equipment volume out of existing backlog. As a result, wind should be modestly profitable in the quarter given stronger onshore results. Turning to Electrification on Slide 9. We had another quarter of robust demand, significant revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 17%, driven by the increasing need for grid equipment. Within Grid Solutions orders remained strong in the U.S., particularly for switchgears. In addition, electrification services orders grew 23%. Revenue increased 24%, driven by Grid Solutions with meaningful growth in switchgears and transformers and by power conversion. EBITDA margin expanded nearly 700 basis points on strong volume with continued price and productivity. The segment achieved its first quarter of double-digit EBITDA margins with all electrification businesses expanding margins in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand and price resulting in electrification revenue growth and substantial EBITDA margin expansion. Equipment orders are outpacing revenue, further expanding the equipment backlog to approximately $19 billion, up almost $6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate further equipment backlog growth driven by continued order strength at healthy margins. Revenue should increase year-over-year but at a more modest rate relative to year-to-date performance, given the comparably strong revenue in 4Q '23. We expect continued margin expansion from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity. Turning to Slide 10 to discuss guidance. While I touched on the fourth quarter for the segments, for GE Vernova overall, we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from higher, more profitable volume pricing and productivity despite losses at offshore. We expect fourth quarter free cash flow to be lower year-over-year as quarterly cash linearity improves. Given we booked our largest onshore order in 4Q last year, the SunZia Wind project, we also expect lower down payments. In addition, we anticipate higher taxes as a result of our EBITDA growth along with higher CapEx, primarily to support future capacity expansion in Gas Power and Electrification. For the full year, we're reaffirming our 2024 GE Vernova guidance as stronger performance in Power and Electrification is offsetting additional losses at Wind. We continue to expect revenue towards the high end of $34 billion to $35 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 5% to 7% and free cash flow to be between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion but trending towards the higher end of the range. By segment, in Power, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with EBITDA margin expansion at the higher end of 150 to 200 basis points from services strength and productivity. At Wind, we still anticipate revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year. Positive price, productivity and cost savings in onshore are expected to partially mitigate losses in offshore. As a result, we expect segment EBITDA to move closer to profitability, improving nearly 50% compared to the $1 billion loss in 2023. In Electrification, we now expect high-teens revenue growth, giving us increased confidence in achieving the upper end of high single-digit EBITDA margins for the year. We're very encouraged by the growing strength we're seeing at Power and Electrification and we're taking steps necessary to deliver better financial results at Wind. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet and we're growing our cash balance. We look forward to providing you with details on our multiyear financial outlook and capital allocation strategy at our December 10 meeting. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. We are pleased with our performance so far this year and excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova and continue creating value for our stakeholders. Specifically, our Power segment generates approximately 70% of its revenue from services and we expect this segment to deliver continued margin expansion with growing free cash flow for a number of years. We expect to continue expanding margins in onshore wind and we are vigorously addressing the challenges in offshore wind. In Electrification, we are seeing customers significantly increase grid-related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero-carbon power sources. We expect this segment to also deliver higher margins in the years to come. As we execute on our strategy, our lean operating system, commitment to sustainability and innovation remain at the core of our company. We are running our businesses better and are well positioned as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the coming years. And when we put all this together, we see a clear opportunity to deliver substantial value for our stakeholders going forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of our call.\nMichael Lapides: Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue if you have follow-ups. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question, circling back on offshore as there was clearly a lot of news there in September. Maybe just remind us kind of as you look today, how you're thinking about the pace of that $3 billion of offshore backlog being worked down? And then there was a good update on the turbine blade issues in North America. Maybe just anything on what's going on with the U.K. project, please?\nScott Strazik: You bet, Julian. I mean it's a start. Clearly, the last 4 months for offshore wind have been difficult for us. I mean the delayed project execution has cost us time on when we had previously talked about completing the backlog we have to go which previously we had said we'd be largely complete by the end of 2025. In light of what we've kind of been managing through the last 4 months, that's moving to the right but we're also at a period of time where we're evaluating alternatives, things like incremental vessels, things like that, that can increase the pace and we're committed to kind of giving you transparency to the burn down of the approximately $3 billion backlog we have left to go when we get together on December 10, as we outline our both '25 financial objectives and our long-range financial targets associated with that. On the blade piece of the equation, just going right there, we've been very intentional and focused on this since the event in July. We can tell you today that the root cause was what we framed up in July. There was a manufacturing deviation at one of our factories in Canada. We have been very systematically reviewing all of our blades in offshore wind and we can say today that a very small proportion, low single-digit proportion of our manufactured blades in totality also had a manufacturing deviation similar to the blade that we experienced the failure in Vineyard Wind. In those cases, we're taking action on those blades and we're doing that right now and really now getting to a point of shifting back to execution out at sea. To your question on Dogger Bank, we're fully in installation and commissioning in Dogger Bank today. In the case of Vineyard, we have been installing both towers and the cells and just got guidance to start to begin reinstalling blades at Vineyard yesterday. So I think this blade chapter, we've learned a lot from the last 3 to 4 months. And now this is back to project execution and we'll give you more on the burn down of the $3 billion to go on December 10.\nKen Parks: And Julian, I would just add where we are, it's important to understand that as we've taken that $700 million charge, we've taken into account all of the things that Scott has outlined. So in other words, we know that there's cost for blade remediation. There's also this extension of the delivery time line which we have some current estimates at but we'll continue to work through it, both on how it may impact the Vineyard Wind project as well as the Dogger Bank project. So the important thing to consider is, we've done a lot of work. The teams have done some outstanding work to make sure that we're staying ahead of this with the customers and making sure we're delivering on our commitments there. But we have attempted our best effort in those charges to encapsulate all the costs that's going to come along with that. So the numbers that we give you are as clean as they can be as far as what it takes to deliver.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe I could ask a question on power. I think you guys said that you expect power equipment orders to accelerate in the fourth quarter. I guess can you talk a little bit about what you're hearing from customers to provide confidence in that outcome?\nScott Strazik: You bet, Nicole. I mean, I'll hit on it. And although the power orders in the third quarter were up 34% and as we said in our prepared remarks, for gas, as an example, we've taken 14 gigawatts of new orders 3Q year-to-date which is twice those equivalent levels in the first 3 quarters of last year. When we look at the pipeline coming from here, we do expect our fourth quarter to be our strongest quarter of 2024. And although it's early and we'll firm this up before December 10, we see the 2025 orders looking very similar to 2024, if not modestly stronger but probably with a larger tilt towards North America. The reality is the orders that we booked this year have been -- had a heavy proportion of Middle East orders. We announced a large order in Japan in the third quarter. U.S. is part of the equation but as we've been saying for quite some time, we see North America and we see the hyperscaler dynamic being more of a '25 dynamic than '24 and that's exactly how we think this is going to still play out sitting here today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Percoco: I want to stick with power for a second. This is a little bit of a higher level question. But clearly, you're seeing a lot of demand, particularly in gas. And if you kind of look back to the early 2000s and 2010s, I mean your power business was a high-teens, low-20s EBITDA margin business. And I'm just kind of curious now that we're entering this next wave of growth in gas, is the current pricing environment supportive of you getting back to that margin structure or is there anything structurally different kind of this time around that might impede your ability to get back there?\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Andrew. I mean, at the start, candidly, we have a much larger services business today than what we would have had at that comparison point because we've been growing the fleet all of these years since then. So at the start, we've got an incredible services annuity stream that's going to sustain itself for a long time. The composition of what's going to play out the second half of this decade relative to early in the 2000s is different in the sense that it's still going to be less gas turbines but the gigawatt or the megawatts really per gas turbine are going to be substantially larger, right, now that we're shifting towards the HA profile. We are seeing substantially better pricing environment today than -- what we're getting in orders today relative to what we're shipping in revenue today. And that will start to benefit us really in, to a large extent, the second half of '26 and the full year of '27 in revenue on what I'd call today's new pricing environment. And when you combine those 2 things together with a much larger services business, a customer sentiment that's investing in that gas fleet substantially more today than certainly have the prior 10 years and that equipment profile that you're citing with better pricing, we have a lot of confidence that throughout the better part of this decade, we're going to keep expanding margins and look forward to giving you really a new definition of what that should look like by 2028 at our December 10 Analyst Day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Scott, so when we met a few months ago, we were talking about a gas power equipment market of, call it, roughly, I don't know, 35 gigawatts by 2028. And it seems like that market has basically effectively doubled overnight. And so the real question I have longer term, as you kind of think about the next few years, is this the new run rate for that business from an order perspective? And then specifically, as it relates to capacity, we know you're increasing your own capacity. Any update that you can give us from the supply chain on their ability to meet faster growth in the next few years?\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Joe. I'd say the orders level that we're seeing for 2024 which, again, as I said before, 14 gigawatts, 3Q year-to-date, twice where we were last year and the fourth quarter should be our strongest quarter. When we package that for '24 and then look at 2025, at minimum based on the visibility we have there, we see 2025 being at equivalent or modestly better orders levels than 2024. And that we can clearly see in front of us and are very comfortable articulating. There is a healthy back -- pipeline beyond that, that we'll work. But we can say that with quite a bit of definition for '24 and '25 that very quickly by the time you get into the first quarter of next year, we're really going to be focused on filling slots primarily in 2028. And that is at that level of 70 to 80 gas turbines per year probably on the lower end in '26, the higher end beyond that because the capacity starts to cut in, in the middle of '26. We don't necessarily see today going materially higher than that 80 number that we've talked about most recently but we're looking at tactical ways to go modestly above that if and when it makes sense. But it's not likely to be another material shift to the extent today's run rate of 55 gas turbines a year, we've now secured capacity to 80, that took us 6 months working with the supply chain to secure. And we're really just continuing to firm that up and make tactical adjustments. No major headlines beyond the updates we've given recently on that.\nKen Parks: Yes. And I think one of the other things to consider as you're thinking about how does that impact us from an investment perspective as we're thinking about building out for this capacity. One of the nice things about the cycle that we're operating in, as you know, is that as we take orders and orders are coming in nicely, those come along with down payments. And we've been pretty clear and Scott said along the way and I think we even said it in the last quarter call that as we're thinking about making investments and we're making these investments for this, growing from 55 units a year to, call it, 70 to 80, we're really funding that with customer orders, right? So customers are coming in, they're making down payments and so the draw on capital really comes directly from the orders that we're taking. And I think that's a really important thing to kind of build into your thinking around how we, as a management team, are making very disciplined decisions around those investment levels.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just pivoting slightly differently within power. As you think about the BWX [ph] opportunity here in GEH, how would you frame SMRs as a proportion of the overall growth trajectory? How would you frame kind of any initial expectations on awards here? Would love to hear the new framing.\nScott Strazik: You bet. I mean I think when we get to nuclear, we really have to start with the existing installed base we have. I mean, in the U.S., as an example, we have 65 plants today with our equipment. And as an illustration, we see at least 3 gigawatts of incremental nuclear capacity we can add with upgrades of the existing installed base that we have and another couple of gigawatts that could get added from restarting plants that aren't running today. So -- and I give that context to just say, in the case of nuclear and with the surge in demand cycle of nuclear that's likely to trickle through to our financials sooner than small modular reactor. We can see orders playing out middle of the decade in that regard that cut into revenue late in the decade. On small modular reactor, sentiment in commercial activity is continuing to accelerate here. The tone of the conversation is also shifting a little bit even in the context of the summer, really, where more discussions are taking place right now with existing nuclear plants that have the security infrastructure within it to add small modular reactors to the security apparatus that already exists with existing plants. That has been a more dynamic conversation the last 90 days than when we were together at the July earnings call. And I think there will be activity there that's going to continue to move forward at a new build that follows. For us, ultimately, this comes back to the first 300-megawatt block of power getting commissioned in Canada in 2029. We don't see that moving to the left. 2029 really is the start. And then from a revenue perspective and really a U.S. new capacity growth perspective, we're really excited about what SMR can mean for us. But it's not going to financially become a meaningful part of our income statement with revenue and growth until early into the next decade. And those activities and those discussions are very healthy right now. But I think it's important to contextualize when it's really going to translate to the financials and it is going to take until then before it becomes a material part of our future growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just to follow-up on JDS' question. It seems that the customer profile, particularly on the nuclear side is changing. We see a lot of headlines about hyperscalers sort of trying to get their own expertise in running these assets. Can you just talk about how the channel is evolving? And are you disadvantaged in any way, shape or form? Because I can see how on gas turbines your traditional customers coming back is a big positive. But these customers do not necessarily have experience with GE, you don't necessarily have a reputation with them. How do you sort of get your fair share on this new class of customers across gas and nuclear?\nScott Strazik: Yes. I would say on nuclear, Andrew, going back to that, I mean, when I think about COP28 last year in Dubai and thinking about 22 heads of state talking about tripling the nuclear capacity in the world by 2050, it's going to be in all the above dynamic with new nuclear add. There's going to be large conventional blocks of power added. There's going to be multiple small modular reactor technologies that are going to be part of the equation. We're really excited about the sentiment shift back towards nuclear and have an incredible amount of confidence in our ability to serve that growing market. To be clear, a lot of the market sentiment with, call it, new archetype of customers that are interested in nuclear power, are going to ultimately, in most cases, still have a traditional nuclear operator running those plants. And those traditional nuclear operators are the bread and butter customers that we have thrived with for decades. The commercial arrangements of exactly how that works between us to those operators of the assets and their commercial arrangement with the end customers, that's a lot of what's materializing and firming up and will take some more time to unfold. And that's a applicable statement for both gas and nuclear. But in both cases, I really like our chances to play a meaningful role serving that growing market. And especially with nuclear, what I would keep emphasizing is, this is about established technology and time to market. And our BWRX is using established fuel, established combustion chamber technology that gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to cut in our first 300-megawatt block of power in 2029. And as we're into construction on that first project in Canada next year, we have a lot of customer sentiment that's following that progress and more commercial activity will follow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Maybe just on onshore wind. I think you said that you can maintain a high single-digit margin on flat revenue but you're still a little conservative on when a new order infection might be. At this point, the understanding that you'll update us again in December, could you sustain the kind of performance you had in onshore? Or when do you kind of need an inflection in onshore wind bookings to support the business?\nScott Strazik: Well, Andy, we see much like we've had flat revenue in '24 relative to '23. When we sit here today, we see flat revenue also in 2025 but with improved profitability in onshore wind and generally a similar looking revenue profile. And that's just the ability to continue to -- we've been remixing the profitability of the backlog and you started to see that in the third quarter with the most profitable quarter we've had in 3 years and you'll see that even more so in the fourth quarter, into next year. We don't need \"orders inflection\" to sustain that performance. I don't have a lot of apprehension that the top line level that we're at today is at risk of going lower, as an example. So by default, I would think of this very much as a floor kind of the escape, the second half performance of 2024 into 2025 on what onshore wind is. For us in a business that is very North America dependent and let's contextualize where we are in North America. We're going to ultimately COD [ph] in the industry this year, mid- to high single-digit gigawatts of new onshore wind. There's a lot of people that believe that number needs to be 15 to 20 gigawatts a year for us to reach our objectives. Where I'm cautious and have been consistently cautious is, when we see the orders come that start to get us back to the U.S. commissioning double-digit mid-teens gigawatts of orders. Now when we do, that volume leverage that we're going to yield on onshore wind is going to lead to a much more profitable business that we're all going to like a lot more. I'm just not ready to call a date on when that comes because we just don't quite see that now, although all indications say the U.S. does need that later in the decade. But I don't want you to take my comments to be one that we're concerned that it's going to go backwards. We feel like we're at a solid foundational level with onshore wind performance that will get better with top line growth. We're just not ready to call that top line growth yet.\nKen Parks: Yes. And I think that -- to repeat something that we've kind of said in the last couple of calls, the wind team and specifically the onshore wind team, Vic and team have been working really hard to take cost out of that business to make sure it is as efficient as it can be. And in doing so, kind of running to what Scott said, to put some numbers around it, they've resized the business to be profitable at about 1,000 turbines a year. We're obviously running at a higher rate than that. So I just say that because to kind of respond to your question around when do we need the wind orders to turn in order to see an inflection in this business. We're already starting to see that inflection in profitability based upon cost management. Plus, I'll remind you that as we came into the year, we talked about an onshore wind backlog that had about 10 incremental points of margin in that backlog. That's really what's giving us confidence in the second half of this year to see the profitability improvement that we're seeing now which does set us up for the carry-on point. I won't necessarily say a jumping off point for incremental growth because pricing has kind of stabilized at these better levels. But to be able to carry us through and then when that inflection comes, we are, because of the hard work of everybody in the business, in a really good place to benefit from it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.\nMark Strouse: So, I want to go back to the comment about the power equipment orders in 2025 and kind of shifting more towards the U.S. with the hyperscalers. As you are progressing with these conversations with the hyperscalers, are you seeing any commonality in the mix of product type that they are interested in as far as kind of aero versus H-class? And then can you remind us, is there any kind of meaningful difference between the 2 as far as kind of lead times or financial profile, anything like that?\nScott Strazik: You bet, Mark. Thanks for the question. And I do think this goes back -- if I start, I would just say the trend is definitely shifting more towards HA gas turbine discussions with consistency than aeroderivative. That's because the hyperscalers are evolving from single data centers dependent on 60 to 100 megawatts to starting to look at data center parks in which you can start to think about multiple gigawatt size data center parks that support a number of data centers in 1 location. So there is a very healthy shift towards what maybe a few years ago, we would have been talking to these customers about aeroderivative applications in Ireland that were backup power for the grid to now this being baseload power with HA gas turbines at the exact time that our HA product line is set to thrive. And just to emphasize a few points there. I mean we have almost 60 gigawatts of HA gas turbines commissioned today. We have over 100 running. We have -- or approaching 3 million operating hours with our HA gas turbines. And for us, this is what is so exciting to us about this part of the orders book because when you start to look into that orders profile for 2025, that we do project to be more U.S.-centric, similar in size to '24, maybe modestly better than 2024 orders level, you're seeing very good equipment economics but then you're also adding more baseload machines that are going to run a substantial amount of the year. So the services calories for us on this equipment opportunity in the life cycle economics are just especially good because you've got the capacity adds and the services calories over the long term that we're really excited about. And that's all part of why with confidence we could make the announcement we did in September that we are adding more capacity for gas from the 55 to the 70 to 80 a year because the life cycle economics are so compelling. And frankly, the payback was so attractive because you've got the equipment margin to keep the payback quite tight but these are going to run at a baseload level for a very long time.\nOperator: This question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Dendrinos: Yes. I appreciate you squeezing me in here. I guess I wanted to hit on electrification here. And I guess, specifically, order demand continues to build. We've heard that the HVDC market could have a backlog out into 2030. So the question is, do you have the capacity to support the demand in electrification? And then on top of that, are you continuing to push prices higher quarter-on-quarter, or is that kind of levelled off here?\nScott Strazik: Chris, I appreciate the question. I mean there's a lot -- just to reframe this for a moment. I mean there's just a lot to be excited about with electrification today. I mean you cited what we've been talking about which is the backlog will be more than triple what it was in the beginning of '23 by the end of the year. We are continuing to see price in today's environment. So we don't feel like we've topped out there in a way that Ken mentioned earlier, where in onshore wind, as an example, that's really levelled off, we're not there today in electrification. Part of why in our prepared remarks, we are intentional to talk about things like the electrification, the transmission business is -- the power transmission business is, we've worked hard over the first 9 months of the year to get to a point that we have a high degree of confidence that we're going to double the capacity of that business and 75% of the capacity is just coming with managing the assets better, managing labor better, adding shifts that doesn't really require CapEx. There's about 25% of the growth to double that does require CapEx, that's site expansion. So we use that illustration to just say it would be a lot harder for us to meet this growing demand if we were doing with greenfield operations. That's not what's happening here. The reality is, I've been around these businesses for a while and broadly the -- call it, energy businesses for a while. And for a big part of that period of time, we had overcapacity in an industrial footprint that was a financial drag. That same industrial footprint, most explicitly in electrification, is now a catalyst that allows us to drive towards growth more capital efficiently and time efficiently than others because we're using existing footprint that has the factory, that has the connection to the railroads, that has the electricity source already. And that's, frankly, where we're seeing the electrification business continue to fulfill faster than we thought. I mean you saw 24% revenue growth in the third quarter, it's because they're continuing to make real progress here executing on their backlog a bit faster than we anticipated when the year started. And now we need to work our way through a budget process in November and share that with you on what it looks like for 2025 but we're excited about that trend. So that's a long-winded context or explanation to say, yes, the backlog is up substantially but we have a lot of industrial assets that we're demonstrating ability to manage very efficiently that's going to allow us to grow into this in a very attractive way.\nKen Parks: And I think that to put a little bit of color on it from a regional perspective that we're excited about is the fact that while the European business has historically and continues to be, in our electrification business, the biggest individual piece of it, what we're seeing is that those growth rates that we saw step up last year with some of the large HVDC orders, while the compares get tougher year-over-year, the order comparisons are good. We're still staying at a good level, not just on HVDC but the other products in the portfolio. But what's really important is, not only is it a dynamic that's driving our business for Europe but the fastest-growing part of our electrification business based upon comps is really in North America. And we're excited about both of those things, both Europe and North America because they will provide multiyear tailwinds for us to continue to see this business grow and expand, as Scott outlined.\nMichael Lapides: Operator, before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott for closing comments.\nScott Strazik: Michael, thank you. Everyone, we're excited about the trajectory of our company. We look forward to talking with many of you in the coming months. At the wrap, as I often do, I do want to thank our employees, our partners for their dedication and their hard work and our customers for their continued trust in us. And thank you for your continued investment interest in GE Vernova. We're looking forward to the months to come. We're in the early innings of a really exciting journey together and really looking forward to having everybody together on December 10 for our analyst meeting. So thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Strazik",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We continue to gain confidence and conviction in the growth trajectory ahead for GE Vernova. We are in the early innings of an investment super cycle in the expansion and decarbonization of the electric power system driven by increasing demand for power, increased focus on energy security and rising grid investments. The GE Vernova purpose has never been more clear and we are excited to have published our first sustainability report last month. Our objective with this report is to provide metrics on our progress in electrifying and decarbonizing the world while ensuring the communities we operate in thrive and simultaneously get better each year in conserving resources with our own operations. A quick discussion on a few of the sustainability metrics we'll measure and update each year. In 2023, we added 29 gigawatts of new capacity to the grid globally with 42% in developing markets. The carbon intensity of this capacity is approximately 25% below the global average carbon intensity of the existing global power sector and has the potential to avoid 20 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year. I share these examples to reinforce our true north in both adding capacity to the grid each year while driving towards a more sustainable electricity system. These sustainability metrics align our broader purpose with our multiyear financial ambitions to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 4. I will spend a few minutes on each of our segments. Our Power segment led by Gas Power delivered strong double-digit orders and revenue growth with over 200 basis points of margin expansion. Power orders increased 34% this quarter, driven by substantial equipment demand both for HA and aeroderivative units as well as services. Year-to-date, we have booked approximately 14 gigawatts of orders for new gas turbines, nearly double last year's level. We expect the fourth quarter to be our largest equipment orders quarter of 2024. As discussed in September, we have now secured capacity to deliver between 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year starting in 2026, up from 55 in recent years. As we look at the anticipated orders profile for 2026 and 2027, even with this capacity expansion, manufacturing slots are scarce. In addition to equipment demand growth, we are seeing services demand in our installed base grow meaningfully. As customers aim to get more capacity and better performance out of their plants, we expect greater demand for upgrades, driving gas services growth. Today, we deliver about $2 billion of upgrades annually in our gas business and we anticipate this could grow by 50% by the end of the decade. There is a lot to be excited about in our Power segment. Electrification is our fastest-growing segment, delivering a 24% revenue increase in the quarter, driven by stronger volume and price. Demand for our products remain strong as customers modernize and invest in critical grid products, such as HVDC systems, transformers and switchgears which are essential to ensuring a reliable electricity system and connecting new generation sources. Over the last 2 years, we have seen our equipment backlog grow meaningfully and profitably and we are on track to more than triple this backlog by year-end '24 from year-end '22 levels of just over $6 billion. This quarter, electrification achieved double-digit EBITDA margin for the first time with expansion of nearly 700 basis points. Demand trends and improving execution are driving an acceleration in margin expansion, increasing our confidence in our trajectory going forward and we expect this business to consistently deliver double-digit EBITDA margins from here. Turning to Wind. In onshore, we continue to improve on our profitability, expanding margins and delivering our most profitable quarter in a number of years. We remain cautious on the timing of the inflection for orders but have positioned this business to deliver high single-digit EBITDA margins on approximately flat revenue this year. We continue to have confidence that as we drive onshore revenue growth, as early as 2026, we can continue to accrete margins in this business. In offshore, we've had a difficult 4 months and are disappointed given the impact on our customers and on our financial results with a significant loss we took this quarter. We have finalized root cause analysis and confirmed the blade issue at Vineyard Wind was caused by a manufacturing deviation from our factory in Canada. We have been very intentional, thorough, not rushed in re-evaluating our blade quality across offshore wind in totality. As we reaccelerate progress on our projects, we are proactively strengthening some of the blades, either back at the factory or in the field to improve quality and readiness for their intended useful life. We continue installing turbines in Dogger Bank, while at Vineyard Wind; we are installing towers and the cells and are very close to resuming blade installation. Looking ahead, we're focused on improving execution and delivering on the approximately $3 billion backlog in the safest, highest quality delivery model that makes economic sense for our customers and ourselves. We do not foresee adding to this backlog without substantially different industry economics than what we see in the marketplace today. I'm proud of our team as they execute in this difficult environment and appreciate the engagement with our customers. I remain confident that we will return the Wind segment to profitability in the fourth quarter. Now over to the right side of the page. We're focused on further embedding lean across the organization, driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery and cost. Safety is our number one priority. And unfortunately, we experienced a fatality this quarter in an onshore wind site in Sweden. We are working to accelerate the company-wide adoption of our lifesaving rules deployed earlier this summer. Turning to quality; an example of how we are implementing lean in our onshore wind business is our workhorse turbine strategy. Today, we have over 2,000 of our workhorse 2.8-megawatt wind turbines that we've commissioned in the last 2 years. These units are performing at approximately 98% availability due to our focus on reduced variance and repeatable operations to drive better quality. On delivery, we are leveraging lean to increase output of our existing manufacturing footprint with limited capital spend needed. As an example, in our power transmission business within grid, we will double the capacity of the manufacturing output of this business, with 75% of the expansion coming from core lean improvements driven by better asset and labor utilization. The remaining 25% of the capacity increase will come from site expansions. On cost, we announced a planned reduction in our offshore wind headcount as part of our efforts to streamline our wind business to make it more efficient and to improve results. We are operating the Wind segment as 1 global business with 3 main product lines, 2 in onshore wind and 1 in offshore wind, with increased visibility, improved learnings across the teams and a better cost structure. We are also driving meaningful productivity with our suppliers in the large electrification projects that we have secured in backlog in the last 21 months. This progress continues to strengthen our confidence in our ability to deliver this growing backlog in electrification for our customers while substantially accreting margins in this business going forward. Turning to the next slide for a look into our third quarter financial performance. We delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders with services up almost 30% and double-digit revenue growth as well as significant margin expansion at power, electrification and onshore wind. That said, our quarter could have been even stronger if not for the quality and execution challenges in offshore wind which we are addressing and learning from to make us a stronger company going forward. We generated substantial free cash flow and increased our cash balance from $5.8 billion in 2Q to $7.4 billion in 3Q. During the quarter, we sold a 16% ownership stake in GE Vernova T&D India, part of the Electrification segment at an attractive valuation that generated approximately $700 million of pre-tax proceeds. This transaction demonstrates how we intend to run GE Vernova. We will monetize assets across our portfolio when we see attractive opportunities to do so, enabling us to invest more in our core businesses to simplify the company and return capital to our shareholders. We are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance. We look forward to discussing our multiyear financial outlook as well as our capital allocation strategy at our Investor Update in New York on December 10. I'm more confident today in the future of our business than ever. And I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our third quarter performance. Thanks, Ken. We are pleased with our performance so far this year and excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova and continue creating value for our stakeholders. Specifically, our Power segment generates approximately 70% of its revenue from services and we expect this segment to deliver continued margin expansion with growing free cash flow for a number of years. We expect to continue expanding margins in onshore wind and we are vigorously addressing the challenges in offshore wind. In Electrification, we are seeing customers significantly increase grid-related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero-carbon power sources. We expect this segment to also deliver higher margins in the years to come. As we execute on our strategy, our lean operating system, commitment to sustainability and innovation remain at the core of our company. We are running our businesses better and are well positioned as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the coming years. And when we put all this together, we see a clear opportunity to deliver substantial value for our stakeholders going forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of our call. You bet, Julian. I mean it's a start. Clearly, the last 4 months for offshore wind have been difficult for us. I mean the delayed project execution has cost us time on when we had previously talked about completing the backlog we have to go which previously we had said we'd be largely complete by the end of 2025. In light of what we've kind of been managing through the last 4 months, that's moving to the right but we're also at a period of time where we're evaluating alternatives, things like incremental vessels, things like that, that can increase the pace and we're committed to kind of giving you transparency to the burn down of the approximately $3 billion backlog we have left to go when we get together on December 10, as we outline our both '25 financial objectives and our long-range financial targets associated with that. On the blade piece of the equation, just going right there, we've been very intentional and focused on this since the event in July. We can tell you today that the root cause was what we framed up in July. There was a manufacturing deviation at one of our factories in Canada. We have been very systematically reviewing all of our blades in offshore wind and we can say today that a very small proportion, low single-digit proportion of our manufactured blades in totality also had a manufacturing deviation similar to the blade that we experienced the failure in Vineyard Wind. In those cases, we're taking action on those blades and we're doing that right now and really now getting to a point of shifting back to execution out at sea. To your question on Dogger Bank, we're fully in installation and commissioning in Dogger Bank today. In the case of Vineyard, we have been installing both towers and the cells and just got guidance to start to begin reinstalling blades at Vineyard yesterday. So I think this blade chapter, we've learned a lot from the last 3 to 4 months. And now this is back to project execution and we'll give you more on the burn down of the $3 billion to go on December 10. You bet, Nicole. I mean, I'll hit on it. And although the power orders in the third quarter were up 34% and as we said in our prepared remarks, for gas, as an example, we've taken 14 gigawatts of new orders 3Q year-to-date which is twice those equivalent levels in the first 3 quarters of last year. When we look at the pipeline coming from here, we do expect our fourth quarter to be our strongest quarter of 2024. And although it's early and we'll firm this up before December 10, we see the 2025 orders looking very similar to 2024, if not modestly stronger but probably with a larger tilt towards North America. The reality is the orders that we booked this year have been -- had a heavy proportion of Middle East orders. We announced a large order in Japan in the third quarter. U.S. is part of the equation but as we've been saying for quite some time, we see North America and we see the hyperscaler dynamic being more of a '25 dynamic than '24 and that's exactly how we think this is going to still play out sitting here today. Thanks, Andrew. I mean, at the start, candidly, we have a much larger services business today than what we would have had at that comparison point because we've been growing the fleet all of these years since then. So at the start, we've got an incredible services annuity stream that's going to sustain itself for a long time. The composition of what's going to play out the second half of this decade relative to early in the 2000s is different in the sense that it's still going to be less gas turbines but the gigawatt or the megawatts really per gas turbine are going to be substantially larger, right, now that we're shifting towards the HA profile. We are seeing substantially better pricing environment today than -- what we're getting in orders today relative to what we're shipping in revenue today. And that will start to benefit us really in, to a large extent, the second half of '26 and the full year of '27 in revenue on what I'd call today's new pricing environment. And when you combine those 2 things together with a much larger services business, a customer sentiment that's investing in that gas fleet substantially more today than certainly have the prior 10 years and that equipment profile that you're citing with better pricing, we have a lot of confidence that throughout the better part of this decade, we're going to keep expanding margins and look forward to giving you really a new definition of what that should look like by 2028 at our December 10 Analyst Day. Thanks, Joe. I'd say the orders level that we're seeing for 2024 which, again, as I said before, 14 gigawatts, 3Q year-to-date, twice where we were last year and the fourth quarter should be our strongest quarter. When we package that for '24 and then look at 2025, at minimum based on the visibility we have there, we see 2025 being at equivalent or modestly better orders levels than 2024. And that we can clearly see in front of us and are very comfortable articulating. There is a healthy back -- pipeline beyond that, that we'll work. But we can say that with quite a bit of definition for '24 and '25 that very quickly by the time you get into the first quarter of next year, we're really going to be focused on filling slots primarily in 2028. And that is at that level of 70 to 80 gas turbines per year probably on the lower end in '26, the higher end beyond that because the capacity starts to cut in, in the middle of '26. We don't necessarily see today going materially higher than that 80 number that we've talked about most recently but we're looking at tactical ways to go modestly above that if and when it makes sense. But it's not likely to be another material shift to the extent today's run rate of 55 gas turbines a year, we've now secured capacity to 80, that took us 6 months working with the supply chain to secure. And we're really just continuing to firm that up and make tactical adjustments. No major headlines beyond the updates we've given recently on that. You bet. I mean I think when we get to nuclear, we really have to start with the existing installed base we have. I mean, in the U.S., as an example, we have 65 plants today with our equipment. And as an illustration, we see at least 3 gigawatts of incremental nuclear capacity we can add with upgrades of the existing installed base that we have and another couple of gigawatts that could get added from restarting plants that aren't running today. So -- and I give that context to just say, in the case of nuclear and with the surge in demand cycle of nuclear that's likely to trickle through to our financials sooner than small modular reactor. We can see orders playing out middle of the decade in that regard that cut into revenue late in the decade. On small modular reactor, sentiment in commercial activity is continuing to accelerate here. The tone of the conversation is also shifting a little bit even in the context of the summer, really, where more discussions are taking place right now with existing nuclear plants that have the security infrastructure within it to add small modular reactors to the security apparatus that already exists with existing plants. That has been a more dynamic conversation the last 90 days than when we were together at the July earnings call. And I think there will be activity there that's going to continue to move forward at a new build that follows. For us, ultimately, this comes back to the first 300-megawatt block of power getting commissioned in Canada in 2029. We don't see that moving to the left. 2029 really is the start. And then from a revenue perspective and really a U.S. new capacity growth perspective, we're really excited about what SMR can mean for us. But it's not going to financially become a meaningful part of our income statement with revenue and growth until early into the next decade. And those activities and those discussions are very healthy right now. But I think it's important to contextualize when it's really going to translate to the financials and it is going to take until then before it becomes a material part of our future growth. Yes. I would say on nuclear, Andrew, going back to that, I mean, when I think about COP28 last year in Dubai and thinking about 22 heads of state talking about tripling the nuclear capacity in the world by 2050, it's going to be in all the above dynamic with new nuclear add. There's going to be large conventional blocks of power added. There's going to be multiple small modular reactor technologies that are going to be part of the equation. We're really excited about the sentiment shift back towards nuclear and have an incredible amount of confidence in our ability to serve that growing market. To be clear, a lot of the market sentiment with, call it, new archetype of customers that are interested in nuclear power, are going to ultimately, in most cases, still have a traditional nuclear operator running those plants. And those traditional nuclear operators are the bread and butter customers that we have thrived with for decades. The commercial arrangements of exactly how that works between us to those operators of the assets and their commercial arrangement with the end customers, that's a lot of what's materializing and firming up and will take some more time to unfold. And that's a applicable statement for both gas and nuclear. But in both cases, I really like our chances to play a meaningful role serving that growing market. And especially with nuclear, what I would keep emphasizing is, this is about established technology and time to market. And our BWRX is using established fuel, established combustion chamber technology that gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to cut in our first 300-megawatt block of power in 2029. And as we're into construction on that first project in Canada next year, we have a lot of customer sentiment that's following that progress and more commercial activity will follow. Well, Andy, we see much like we've had flat revenue in '24 relative to '23. When we sit here today, we see flat revenue also in 2025 but with improved profitability in onshore wind and generally a similar looking revenue profile. And that's just the ability to continue to -- we've been remixing the profitability of the backlog and you started to see that in the third quarter with the most profitable quarter we've had in 3 years and you'll see that even more so in the fourth quarter, into next year. We don't need \"orders inflection\" to sustain that performance. I don't have a lot of apprehension that the top line level that we're at today is at risk of going lower, as an example. So by default, I would think of this very much as a floor kind of the escape, the second half performance of 2024 into 2025 on what onshore wind is. For us in a business that is very North America dependent and let's contextualize where we are in North America. We're going to ultimately COD [ph] in the industry this year, mid- to high single-digit gigawatts of new onshore wind. There's a lot of people that believe that number needs to be 15 to 20 gigawatts a year for us to reach our objectives. Where I'm cautious and have been consistently cautious is, when we see the orders come that start to get us back to the U.S. commissioning double-digit mid-teens gigawatts of orders. Now when we do, that volume leverage that we're going to yield on onshore wind is going to lead to a much more profitable business that we're all going to like a lot more. I'm just not ready to call a date on when that comes because we just don't quite see that now, although all indications say the U.S. does need that later in the decade. But I don't want you to take my comments to be one that we're concerned that it's going to go backwards. We feel like we're at a solid foundational level with onshore wind performance that will get better with top line growth. We're just not ready to call that top line growth yet. You bet, Mark. Thanks for the question. And I do think this goes back -- if I start, I would just say the trend is definitely shifting more towards HA gas turbine discussions with consistency than aeroderivative. That's because the hyperscalers are evolving from single data centers dependent on 60 to 100 megawatts to starting to look at data center parks in which you can start to think about multiple gigawatt size data center parks that support a number of data centers in 1 location. So there is a very healthy shift towards what maybe a few years ago, we would have been talking to these customers about aeroderivative applications in Ireland that were backup power for the grid to now this being baseload power with HA gas turbines at the exact time that our HA product line is set to thrive. And just to emphasize a few points there. I mean we have almost 60 gigawatts of HA gas turbines commissioned today. We have over 100 running. We have -- or approaching 3 million operating hours with our HA gas turbines. And for us, this is what is so exciting to us about this part of the orders book because when you start to look into that orders profile for 2025, that we do project to be more U.S.-centric, similar in size to '24, maybe modestly better than 2024 orders level, you're seeing very good equipment economics but then you're also adding more baseload machines that are going to run a substantial amount of the year. So the services calories for us on this equipment opportunity in the life cycle economics are just especially good because you've got the capacity adds and the services calories over the long term that we're really excited about. And that's all part of why with confidence we could make the announcement we did in September that we are adding more capacity for gas from the 55 to the 70 to 80 a year because the life cycle economics are so compelling. And frankly, the payback was so attractive because you've got the equipment margin to keep the payback quite tight but these are going to run at a baseload level for a very long time. Chris, I appreciate the question. I mean there's a lot -- just to reframe this for a moment. I mean there's just a lot to be excited about with electrification today. I mean you cited what we've been talking about which is the backlog will be more than triple what it was in the beginning of '23 by the end of the year. We are continuing to see price in today's environment. So we don't feel like we've topped out there in a way that Ken mentioned earlier, where in onshore wind, as an example, that's really levelled off, we're not there today in electrification. Part of why in our prepared remarks, we are intentional to talk about things like the electrification, the transmission business is -- the power transmission business is, we've worked hard over the first 9 months of the year to get to a point that we have a high degree of confidence that we're going to double the capacity of that business and 75% of the capacity is just coming with managing the assets better, managing labor better, adding shifts that doesn't really require CapEx. There's about 25% of the growth to double that does require CapEx, that's site expansion. So we use that illustration to just say it would be a lot harder for us to meet this growing demand if we were doing with greenfield operations. That's not what's happening here. The reality is, I've been around these businesses for a while and broadly the -- call it, energy businesses for a while. And for a big part of that period of time, we had overcapacity in an industrial footprint that was a financial drag. That same industrial footprint, most explicitly in electrification, is now a catalyst that allows us to drive towards growth more capital efficiently and time efficiently than others because we're using existing footprint that has the factory, that has the connection to the railroads, that has the electricity source already. And that's, frankly, where we're seeing the electrification business continue to fulfill faster than we thought. I mean you saw 24% revenue growth in the third quarter, it's because they're continuing to make real progress here executing on their backlog a bit faster than we anticipated when the year started. And now we need to work our way through a budget process in November and share that with you on what it looks like for 2025 but we're excited about that trend. So that's a long-winded context or explanation to say, yes, the backlog is up substantially but we have a lot of industrial assets that we're demonstrating ability to manage very efficiently that's going to allow us to grow into this in a very attractive way. Michael, thank you. Everyone, we're excited about the trajectory of our company. We look forward to talking with many of you in the coming months. At the wrap, as I often do, I do want to thank our employees, our partners for their dedication and their hard work and our customers for their continued trust in us. And thank you for your continued investment interest in GE Vernova. We're looking forward to the months to come. We're in the early innings of a really exciting journey together and really looking forward to having everybody together on December 10 for our analyst meeting. So thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 6. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with double-digit orders and revenue growth led by Power and Electrification. Margins expanded year-over-year across power, electrification and onshore wind but were offset primarily due to additional contract losses at offshore wind. Importantly, we generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter driven by strong working capital management, including improved linearity. Orders grew 17%, driven by services which increased 28% with double-digit growth across all 3 segments. Equipment orders grew approximately 8%. Power and electrification equipment orders grew substantially, partially offset by lower equipment orders at wind. Our backlog of $118 billion grew both year-over-year and sequentially and equipment margin and backlog remains healthy, reflecting our disciplined profitable growth priority. Revenue increased 10% in both equipment and services. Service revenue grew in all 3 segments, while continued momentum in Electrification and Power drove higher equipment revenue. In addition, price remained positive across all 3 segments. Adjusted EBITDA continued to reflect higher, more profitable volume, price and productivity in the quarter. On an organic basis, Electrification realized nearly 700 basis points of margin expansion and Power margins expanded more than 200 basis points. This margin strength was offset by Wind, primarily due to higher contract losses at offshore. We delivered nearly $1 billion of positive free cash flow improving $900 million year-over-year, primarily driven by stronger working capital management. Working capital was an approximately $600 million benefit in the quarter improving over $500 million year-over-year, mainly due to improved linearity which includes more closely aligning the timing of disbursements and collections. Our cash balance also reflects the monetization of a 16% ownership stake in our electrification joint venture in India which generated approximately $700 million of pre-tax proceeds classified as financing cash flows with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. We executed this transaction as a part of our ongoing process to simplify entity shareholding structures as well as to capitalize on strong equity valuations in India, while remaining the majority shareholder in this business, serving an attractive market. Combined with our third quarter free cash flow, these proceeds increased our already solid cash balance to $7.4 billion. We're encouraged by our year-to-date financial performance with solid revenue growth led by services which increased 9% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 200 basis points and more than $1.1 billion of positive free cash flow generation, a year-over-year improvement of over $2 billion. Our backlog growth in both services and equipment provides an excellent foundation for continued strong financial performance. Turning to Power on Slide 7. The segment delivered another strong quarter with continued double-digit orders growth, increasing revenue and further EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 34%, led by higher equipment and services at Gas Power. Gas Power equipment orders increased 40% as we booked 9 HA units in the quarter which exceeded the total number of HAs booked in all of 2023. We also booked 15 aeroderivative units in the quarter, almost doubling units ordered in the third quarter of last year. Power services orders were up 29% due to higher demand from outages and upgrades. The robust demand for gas equipment and services is driving further growth in our backlog. Based upon the backlog, we're funding capacity expansion from customer orders and related down payments to enable delivery of 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines annually starting in 2026. Revenue grew 13%, driven by Gas Power. Services increased mainly from higher outage volume as well as price. Equipment revenue reflected growth in HA gas turbine deliveries. EBITDA increased 45%, resulting in 240 basis points of margin expansion as higher volume, productivity and price more than offset the impact of inflation. We're using lean to drive better operational execution and productivity which is improving equipment profitability. For example, the heavy-duty gas turbine team enhanced standard work from underwriting to execution through a series of kaizens. This work has resulted in a 20% improvement in quality control so far this year, generating productivity and margin expansion. We continue to leverage lean to drive better financial results and better outcomes for our customers. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect gas equipment orders to accelerate. We anticipate higher HA deliveries and services revenue to be offset by lower aeroderivative deliveries, resulting in relatively flat revenue, EBITDA and margin compared to a strong 4Q '23. We also expect continued productivity to offset inflation. At Wind, onshore delivered its most profitable results in 12 quarters, while we incurred additional offshore contract losses related to the impacts of recent blade events and expected project execution delays. Wind orders declined 19% due to lower onshore equipment orders outside of North America as we remain selective about the markets we serve. In offshore, we remain focused on executing our existing challenged backlog. Revenue decreased slightly in the quarter. In offshore, the impact of execution delays resulted in lower revenue, partially offset by a settlement of approximately $500 million for a previously cancelled offshore project. In onshore, revenue grew due to higher North America equipment and services despite lower volume outside of North America. EBITDA margins contracted 410 basis points versus the prior year. In offshore, the impact of the approximately $700 million charge for additional contract losses was partially offset by the $300 million gain from the offshore project cancellation settlement. In onshore, margins expanded from positive price and favorable equipment mix. Onshore delivered better results despite higher services costs as we're deploying more crews and cranes to continue improving fleet availability. Overall, we're focused on driving better quality, cost and execution productivity across wind. As discussed, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers navigate growing interconnection queues. We do expect the Wind segment to grow revenue and EBITDA substantially in the fourth quarter as we deliver more higher-margin onshore equipment volume out of existing backlog. As a result, wind should be modestly profitable in the quarter given stronger onshore results. Turning to Electrification on Slide 9. We had another quarter of robust demand, significant revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 17%, driven by the increasing need for grid equipment. Within Grid Solutions orders remained strong in the U.S., particularly for switchgears. In addition, electrification services orders grew 23%. Revenue increased 24%, driven by Grid Solutions with meaningful growth in switchgears and transformers and by power conversion. EBITDA margin expanded nearly 700 basis points on strong volume with continued price and productivity. The segment achieved its first quarter of double-digit EBITDA margins with all electrification businesses expanding margins in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand and price resulting in electrification revenue growth and substantial EBITDA margin expansion. Equipment orders are outpacing revenue, further expanding the equipment backlog to approximately $19 billion, up almost $6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate further equipment backlog growth driven by continued order strength at healthy margins. Revenue should increase year-over-year but at a more modest rate relative to year-to-date performance, given the comparably strong revenue in 4Q '23. We expect continued margin expansion from higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity. Turning to Slide 10 to discuss guidance. While I touched on the fourth quarter for the segments, for GE Vernova overall, we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from higher, more profitable volume pricing and productivity despite losses at offshore. We expect fourth quarter free cash flow to be lower year-over-year as quarterly cash linearity improves. Given we booked our largest onshore order in 4Q last year, the SunZia Wind project, we also expect lower down payments. In addition, we anticipate higher taxes as a result of our EBITDA growth along with higher CapEx, primarily to support future capacity expansion in Gas Power and Electrification. For the full year, we're reaffirming our 2024 GE Vernova guidance as stronger performance in Power and Electrification is offsetting additional losses at Wind. We continue to expect revenue towards the high end of $34 billion to $35 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 5% to 7% and free cash flow to be between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion but trending towards the higher end of the range. By segment, in Power, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with EBITDA margin expansion at the higher end of 150 to 200 basis points from services strength and productivity. At Wind, we still anticipate revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year. Positive price, productivity and cost savings in onshore are expected to partially mitigate losses in offshore. As a result, we expect segment EBITDA to move closer to profitability, improving nearly 50% compared to the $1 billion loss in 2023. In Electrification, we now expect high-teens revenue growth, giving us increased confidence in achieving the upper end of high single-digit EBITDA margins for the year. We're very encouraged by the growing strength we're seeing at Power and Electrification and we're taking steps necessary to deliver better financial results at Wind. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet and we're growing our cash balance. We look forward to providing you with details on our multiyear financial outlook and capital allocation strategy at our December 10 meeting. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott. And Julian, I would just add where we are, it's important to understand that as we've taken that $700 million charge, we've taken into account all of the things that Scott has outlined. So in other words, we know that there's cost for blade remediation. There's also this extension of the delivery time line which we have some current estimates at but we'll continue to work through it, both on how it may impact the Vineyard Wind project as well as the Dogger Bank project. So the important thing to consider is, we've done a lot of work. The teams have done some outstanding work to make sure that we're staying ahead of this with the customers and making sure we're delivering on our commitments there. But we have attempted our best effort in those charges to encapsulate all the costs that's going to come along with that. So the numbers that we give you are as clean as they can be as far as what it takes to deliver. Yes. And I think one of the other things to consider as you're thinking about how does that impact us from an investment perspective as we're thinking about building out for this capacity. One of the nice things about the cycle that we're operating in, as you know, is that as we take orders and orders are coming in nicely, those come along with down payments. And we've been pretty clear and Scott said along the way and I think we even said it in the last quarter call that as we're thinking about making investments and we're making these investments for this, growing from 55 units a year to, call it, 70 to 80, we're really funding that with customer orders, right? So customers are coming in, they're making down payments and so the draw on capital really comes directly from the orders that we're taking. And I think that's a really important thing to kind of build into your thinking around how we, as a management team, are making very disciplined decisions around those investment levels. Yes. And I think that -- to repeat something that we've kind of said in the last couple of calls, the wind team and specifically the onshore wind team, Vic and team have been working really hard to take cost out of that business to make sure it is as efficient as it can be. And in doing so, kind of running to what Scott said, to put some numbers around it, they've resized the business to be profitable at about 1,000 turbines a year. We're obviously running at a higher rate than that. So I just say that because to kind of respond to your question around when do we need the wind orders to turn in order to see an inflection in this business. We're already starting to see that inflection in profitability based upon cost management. Plus, I'll remind you that as we came into the year, we talked about an onshore wind backlog that had about 10 incremental points of margin in that backlog. That's really what's giving us confidence in the second half of this year to see the profitability improvement that we're seeing now which does set us up for the carry-on point. I won't necessarily say a jumping off point for incremental growth because pricing has kind of stabilized at these better levels. But to be able to carry us through and then when that inflection comes, we are, because of the hard work of everybody in the business, in a really good place to benefit from it. And I think that to put a little bit of color on it from a regional perspective that we're excited about is the fact that while the European business has historically and continues to be, in our electrification business, the biggest individual piece of it, what we're seeing is that those growth rates that we saw step up last year with some of the large HVDC orders, while the compares get tougher year-over-year, the order comparisons are good. We're still staying at a good level, not just on HVDC but the other products in the portfolio. But what's really important is, not only is it a dynamic that's driving our business for Europe but the fastest-growing part of our electrification business based upon comps is really in North America. And we're excited about both of those things, both Europe and North America because they will provide multiyear tailwinds for us to continue to see this business grow and expand, as Scott outlined."

My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\\\nMichael Lapides: Thank you, operator. Welcome to GE Vernova's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik and CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's Form 10-Q, the press release and in the presentation slides all of which are available on our website. Please note that year-over-year commentary or variances on orders, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margin discussed during our prepared remarks are on an organic basis. We will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we do not undertake any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion across all three segments and substantial improvement in free cash flow. Macro trends are continuing to create meaningful opportunities for us to lead in the energy transition. First, we're seeing increasing demand for power generation driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs and emerging data center needs. Second, there is a significant need for grid infrastructure investments to support both energy security and reliability goals. And third, our customers are investing to decarbonize their power systems, which drives demand for low and zero-carbon generation as well as new grid connections. We're serving this robust market demand while simultaneously running our businesses better, driving disciplined growth, margin expansion and higher free cash flow. Turning to slide 4. I'll spend a few minutes on each of our segments. Our Power segment led by Gas Power delivered growth in both equipment and high-margin services orders and revenue, while also achieving 180 basis points of margin expansion. Power orders increased 30% this quarter led by strength in equipment orders which more than doubled year-over-year. Notably we recently commissioned our 100th HA gas turbine in South Korea. The H-class fleet is an important source of growing services revenue and billings for our Power segment. In the second half of this year, we expect continued strength in orders with heavy-duty gas turbines including HA units to be higher versus first half 2024. Electrification is our fastest-growing segment. Profitable growth continues as customers modernize and invest in new products such as transformers and switch gears that are key to ensuring a reliable electricity system and connecting new generation sources. For example, orders more than doubled this quarter in North America which continues to be a key growth opportunity for this segment. Overall, the Electrification segment has grown its backlog by over 25% since the start of the year. I'm pleased with the team's progress on margins which expanded 360 basis points this quarter and I have conviction we can drive significant margin expansion given the electrification segment's strong demand and strong industry pricing dynamics. We are thoughtfully investing to increase our output levels for this rising demand. For example, we are almost doubling capacity our Stafford facility in the UK to deliver HVDC transformers. Right now, Wind remains the most challenging segment. While we grew onshore backlog in the quarter we remain cautious on the timing of an inflection in onshore orders as customers navigate the challenges that come with permitting new projects and higher interest rates. We are nearly two years into our Onshore Wind quality improvement program and we are making progress with no new significant issues identified. We continue to look for ways to implement the improvements into our existing fleet at a faster pace. In order to deliver for customers, we are adding crews to the field and gaining access to more cranes to accelerate our work. For our new units, we are leveraging technologies including our blade inspection robot to enhance our manufacturing process. At Offshore, we have converted almost $800 million of our backlog to revenue in the first half of the year. Last week, we had a turbine blade event at our Vineyard Wind project. The turbine was shut down safely and no one was injured. With safety always as a top priority, we are working with our customer and the appropriate agencies to determine the root cause and then implement corrective actions and a restart plan. While we continue to work to finalize our root cause analysis, our investigation to date indicates that the affected blade experience a manufacturing deviation. We have not identified information indicating an engineering design flaw in the blade or information of a connection with the blade event we experienced in an Offshore Wind project in the U.K., which was caused by an installation error out at sea. We are working with urgency to scrutinize our operations across Offshore Wind. Pace matters here, but we are going to be thorough instead of rushed. Going forward, we remain highly selective on potential offshore win new orders, focused on achieving substantially higher pricing, and disciplined commercial terms. In the Wind segment overall this quarter, we expanded margins by 400 basis points and see opportunities for further expansion. We still expect the Wind segment to approach profitability this year and become profitable in 2025. Longer term, wind should play a critical role in the energy transition. Now, over to the right side of the page. We are driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery, and cost. On safety, after 10 consecutive months of fatality-free operations, June was a tough month for us. An employee of ours in Malaysia lost his life driving to a work site in his personal car and a one car accident on a public road and a contractor working in our direction in Turkey lost his life with an arc flash event at a wind farm. Safety will always be the top priority at GE Vernova in both events reinforce our need to continue to get better to ensure our employees and contractors return home at the end of work. Turning to Quality, where we are always working to improve our outcomes for our customers. For example in a year where gas outages increased double-digits, our team has reduced quality deviations by 15% from live outage, our lean-enabled digital outage platform that reduces cycle-times and improve the field execution experience for our customers. We are also using lean to improve delivery. In Electrification, the team in France recently executed a series of Kaizens tackling material flow, scheduling, and increasing capacity. As a result of the new processes we implemented, one of the production cells increased its output of certain switchgear components by 135% from 17 per week to more than 40 per week, helping to drive the growth we are seeing in our electrification segment and ultimately, improving outcomes for our customers. Finally, we are using lean to simplify our operations and reduce G&A costs. We are focusing on reducing our G&A and driving productivity at our corporate center and in our segments. We began executing cost-out initiatives in the second quarter that give me increased confidence in our ability to realize G&A reductions in 2025. Turning to the next slide for a look into our strong second quarter financial performance. Orders were robust with 2Q 2024 marking the second largest order quarter we've delivered over the last three years and we saw healthy equipment backlog growth across multiple businesses, especially in Gas Power and Grid. We delivered disciplined top line growth led by the strength in price and services volume. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points with expansion across all segments. Notably, we generated positive free cash flow with an over $1 billion improvement year-over-year as well as sequentially and ended the second quarter with a $5.8 billion cash balance. We are raising our 2024 guidance and now expect revenue to trend towards the higher end of our $34 billion to $35 billion range largely on Electrification. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be 5% to 7%, up from previous expectations of the higher end of mid-single digits. The improvement is driven by Power, which we now expect will deliver 150 to 200 basis points of organic margin expansion and Electrification where we expect high single-digit margins. We are also raising our 2024 free cash flow guidance. We expect to deliver between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion up from the prior $700 million to $1.1 billion range. Overall, with continued demand growth further margin expansion and strong free cash flow, we feel confident about the momentum in our business for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our second quarter performance and our latest guidance.\nKen Parks: Thanks, Scott. Let's turn to Slide 6. As already stated, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with EBITDA margin expansion across all three segments and positive free cash flow generation. Demand remains robust as orders reached nearly $12 billion which Scott mentioned was our second largest orders quarter in the last three years, and approximately 1.4x second quarter revenue. Power equipment orders more than doubled and total services orders grew double-digits with strength in Power and Electrification. Due to large Offshore Wind and HVDC equipment orders booked in the second quarter of last year, orders were 7% lower year-over-year. Our backlog remains sizable at $115 billion, including the impact of the recently completed divestiture of a portion of steam power to EDF. Importantly, equipment margin and backlog remains healthy in line with our disciplined profitable growth priority. Revenue grew 2% with continued strength in electrification and power, partially offset by Wind. Services revenue remained solid, increasing 9% with growth across all segments. In addition, all three segments benefited from positive price again this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 85% driving 320 basis points of margin expansion. All segments delivered more than 150 basis points of expansion in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, price and services volume which more than offset inflationary impacts. In addition, we continue to benefit from our previously announced restructuring actions largely at Wind and Power. We delivered over $800 million of positive free cash flow improving more than $1 billion both sequentially and year-over-year from working capital and higher adjusted EBITDA partially offset by higher cash taxes. Working capital was an approximately $760 million benefit in the quarter, improving over $700 million year-over-year due primarily to strong collections. In the quarter, we received an approximately $300 million refund resulting from a positive arbitration decision in an open multiemployer pension plan dispute which is included in free cash flow. The P&L benefit of approximately $250 million was recorded in SG&A and was excluded from adjusted SG&A and adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as a result of completing the sale of a portion of steam power, we received approximately $600 million of net proceeds, which are classified outside of free cash flow and recognized an almost $900 million pre-tax gain in the quarter which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The combination of free cash flow generation and proceeds from divestitures increased our already solid cash balance to $5.8 billion. Overall, we're encouraged by our financial performance in the first half of 2024 with organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of nearly 400 basis points and positive free cash flow generation. Now turning to Power on slide 7. The segment delivered another strong quarter with double-digit orders growth, solid revenue growth and further EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 30%, led by higher equipment at Gas Power and Hydro power. During the second quarter, Gas Power equipment orders increased over 60% as we booked 14 heavy-duty gas turbines, which included four HA units compared to no HA unit bookings in 2023 second quarter. Power Services orders grew 12%, driven by Gas Power. Revenue grew 10% on higher gas service volumes. Equipment revenue also increased from Gas Power strength. EBITDA increased 24%, resulting in 180 basis points of margin expansion as higher services volume, productivity and price more than offset the impact of inflation. Looking ahead, we see increased demand for gas as a reliable source of baseload generation, which is resulting in incremental growth opportunities for both Gas equipment and Gas services over the medium to long-term. We anticipate additional 2024 CapEx at power to fulfill demand on gas orders that are already booked, and we continue to evaluate strategies to meet potential additional demand acceleration. Turning to Wind, we continued making progress in driving improved EBITDA despite lower revenue levels. Orders declined 44%, given the tough comparison to the second quarter of last year, when a large offshore equipment order was booked. As a reminder, that offshore order was later canceled by the customer in the fourth quarter of 2023. Onshore equipment orders declined 11%, but increased more than 2.5 times sequentially from the first quarter. As Scott indicated earlier, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers navigate growing interconnection queues and higher interest rates. Revenue decreased 20% from lower onshore equipment deliveries, partially offset by higher offshore revenue as we continue to execute on our offshore equipment backlog. EBITDA margins improved 400 basis points versus the prior year from positive price and continued cost reductions. At offshore, EBITDA losses decreased, and onshore margins improved despite lower volume, remaining profitable again in the second quarter. Wind is demonstrating signs of financial progress. We continue our work at both onshore and offshore to drive incremental cost leverage. In the second half of 2024, we expect to further improve EBITDA on meaningfully higher onshore equipment volume at better margins, which are currently in our existing backlog. Now at electrification, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders were $4.8 billion, roughly 2.7 times second quarter revenue and over 30% higher sequentially. While remaining strong, second quarter orders declined year-over-year due to significantly higher HVDC orders recorded in the prior year. Within Grid Solutions, we saw strong orders growth in the US, particularly for high-voltage switchgears and circuit breakers. Revenue grew 19% with strength in equipment led by Grid Solutions and Power Conversion. EBITDA margin expanded 360 basis points on volume, price and productivity. All of our electrification businesses were profitable in the second quarter, and expanded margins both year over year and sequentially. We continue to see strong demand and price resulting in electrification revenue growth and meaningful EBITDA margin expansion. Equipment backlog in this segment increased to approximately $17 billion, up $5 billion compared to the second quarter of 2023, with healthy margins. Turning to slide 10. Largely based upon our strong first half performance, we're raising our full year 2024 guidance. For revenue, we're now trending towards the high end of our original $34 billion to $35 billion guidance range, mostly due to additional Electrification strength. We're also increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of 5% to 7%. By segment, we maintain our power revenue guidance, but now anticipate approximately 150 to 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion compared to our previous guide of approximately 100 basis points driven mainly by Gas Power strength. At Wind, we still expect revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year and to approach profitability this year from positive price productivity and cost savings. In the second half the timing of turbine shipments as well as cost could drive some variability in wind results. In Electrification, we're increasing our revenue growth guidance from low double digits to mid- to high teens based on continued strong demand and favorable price. Given our higher revenue growth expectations we now expect electrification to achieve high single-digit EBITDA margins in 2024 compared to our previous expectation of mid-single digits. As a result of the higher EBITDA outlook along with the strong cash performance and the nonrecurring arbitration refund in the first half of 2024 we're also increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. This includes slightly higher expected CapEx investments primarily to fulfill significant gas power orders booked so far this year. Looking specifically at the third quarter we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth and continued EBITDA margin expansion across the segments. Relative to last year's third quarter we anticipate power top line growth from higher gas equipment and services revenue and EBITDA margin expansion versus last year from volume productivity and pricing. Wind revenue is expected to grow meaningfully year-over-year as we deliver higher-margin onshore volume out of backlog. In addition EBITDA should improve from the higher onshore volume along with positive price and lower cost structure. At Electrification, we expect solid top line growth along with margin expansion from higher volume productivity and favorable pricing. In the third quarter note that like in most years the seasonality of outages and services revenue at Gas Power means lower adjusted EBITDA on a sequential basis for GE Vernova. We expect free cash flow to improve year-over-year driven by the stronger adjusted EBITDA. Sequentially, we anticipate free cash flow to decrease largely from the lower adjusted EBITDA slightly higher CapEx and cash taxes as well as the nonrecurring arbitration refund received in the second quarter. We're very encouraged by the momentum we built in the first half of the year. We're also confident in the strength of our balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating as we evaluate opportunities for growth and return of capital to shareholders. With that I'll turn it back to Scott.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. All in we are pleased with our performance in the first half of this year and we are excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova. Our Power segment generates 70% of its revenues from services. We expect power to drive expanded margins with growing free cash flow for a number of years. We expect to continue expanding margins in Wind and to benefit when demand for new Wind units especially in North America ramps further. In Electrification, we are seeing customers significantly increase grid-related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero carbon power sources. We expect this segment to also continue to deliver higher margins in the years to come. Our lean operating system sustainability and innovation remain at the core of our company. We are running our businesses better and are well positioned as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the coming years. And when we put all this together we see a clear opportunity to deliver substantial value for our stakeholders going forward. With that I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call.\nMichael Lapides: Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue if you have follow-ups. With that, operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.\nMark Strouse: Yes. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our question. So I wanted to start with the Wind segment and just kind of the Vineyard Wind project that's been in the news. I appreciate you're taking your time, you're being thorough with a review here. Just for those on the line that haven't been through one of these before, can you just kind of talk about what that time line might be though? I mean should we be expecting this to be more kind of weeks or months or maybe even quarters? And then kind of the second question on that is. Is there any impact to your deliveries on the Dogger Bank project in Europe?\nScott Strazik: Mark, thanks for the question. It's been 11 days since the event. Just to reinforce at the start, we have no indications of an engineering design flaw that's important at the beginning. As we said in the prepared remarks, we have identified a material deviation or a manufacturing deviation in one of our factories that through the inspection or quality assurance process, we should have identified. Because of that, we're going to use our existing data and reinspect all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind and for context in this factory in Gasp\u00e9, Canada where the material deviation existed, we've made about 150 blades, so that gives you an indication and context of the work ahead. But to be clear, this is work we know how to do. I mean the industry uses non-destructive testing, think ultrasound, think a radiologist, but for a blade to identify deviations. We are going to go and do this on every blade, prudent thorough process. We're not going to talk about the time line today. We have work to do, but I have a high degree of confidence that we can do this, and we'll do it in support of both the customer and the agency and move forward from there. On your question on kind of deliveries and timing, I would just frame up a few things. I mean, clearly, while we're on pause right now, there's risk to some collections moving from 2024 into 2025. And that is embedded into our financial guidance here for what we framed up and we're really taking the path forward. Now, on Dogger Bank, we continue to install and commission wind turbines right now, and we intend to continue to do that. We're in close contact with SSC, and we continue to progress on that project today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, Guys.\nScott Strazik: Good morning, Andy.\nKen Parks: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Scott, so if I look at sort of the order environment and wind just out of curiosity, I know you reiterated the flat revenue guidance. But at what point does Wind have to pick up before you get into 2025 and it becomes a more difficult year. And are you still planning on sort of the high single-digit margin in onshore in the second half of 2024?\nScott Strazik: Yeah. We are. I mean, we're still consistent with our financial framing of approaching profitability in 2024 in the segment with high single-digit onshore wind margins in 2024 and the segment turning profitable in 2025, Andy. What I would just emphasize is we -- 2024 and 2025 as we've been framing up for a period of time are two more difficult years for us and win relative to the dynamics we have in the other segments. But we remain confident in that framework for 2024 and 2025. And then when you look at the orders pipeline that we see, it's just tough for us to call when it starts to convert into orders, we still see the possibility that we could see those orders come through in 2025 that leads to a revenue inflection point in 2026 on onshore at the exact same time that we'll still be materially through our Offshore Wind backlog. So 2024 and 2025 is going to be very consistent with what we've talked about. And then you're really playing through to 2026, where we see the real possibility for margins to accrete substantially as we have the potential for some Onshore Wind growth and Offshore Wind becomes a smaller proportion of the total revenue guide.\nKen Parks: Yeah. And the one thing I would add, I think it's the right question around thinking about 2025, but also remember that as we're moving through the second half of 2024, we called out an Onshore Wind in the backlog as of the end of 2023 that we had expanded our margin within that backlog by about 10 full points. Some of that will begin to deliver in 2024 in the second half, which gives us confidence in the statements that we made, and that Scott just reiterated about our outlook and approaching profitability for the year for Wind overall. But some of that accretion and backlog will deliver in 2025. So part of the step-up in 2025, as you asked about, will be incremental Wind orders coming in the second half. But a piece of that is already in our backlog and we will deliver on it as we move into the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Dendrinos: Yes. Good morning. I guess maybe just following up on part of that question there. Can you talk about some of the margins that are embedded in your order demand today and sort of where the, I guess, things are going forward specific maybe to Electrification and Power? Thanks.\nScott Strazik: Can you please repeat the question team? We're having an audio challenge here in the room?\nChris Dendrinos: Yes. I guess I was just following-up on the last question. You made some comments around the margins embedded in that Wind backlog. And I'm curious what the margin profile looks like for the backlog in Power and Electrification. I think you'd previously mentioned some strong pricing dynamics in both those segments. I'm kind of curious where things are at today?\nKen Parks: Yes. So we would tell you that in the -- let's start with the Wind, because I think it's important as we're also -- I gave you the 2023 number, what's happening as we move into 2024. We had seen Wind margin backlogs accrete and grow as, call it, the last 12 to 18 months as we move towards the end of 2023. What we're seeing in orders that we're taking in now is that better pricing is actually staying at kind of those levels as we move through the first half of the year. So, it's moved up and it's kind of staying at those levels. Now the difference is to where you asked about on Power and Electrification. As those demand patterns have continued to grow, what we've seen is the pricing environment has continued to get stronger versus where we ended 2023, both in Power and Electrification. And a point of reference is on Electrification, we had talked about for overall Electrification equipment at the end of 2023, our margins and backlog had expanded 5-full points. And so we're seeing that continue to grow as we move over time and any quarter point can have a little bit of volatility to it, but the pricing dynamic within Electrification continuing to get better, booking better, stronger profitable orders and backlog. And obviously, the same thing on the Power dynamics, as you see the really strong orders coming on to the books.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nScott Strazik: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Hey, Good morning, guys.\nKen Parks: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: I want to focus my question on Gas Power equipment orders. And so year-to-date you guys have booked 9-gigawatts of orders, which is pretty incredible given where we were last year. Scott, how much of this do you think is the market expanding versus market share gains? And then also, your commentary around the HAs being -- having better order rates in the second half of the year. I'm just curious if you can maybe just talk about your visibility and the conversations that you're having with data centers as well.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Joe. I mean clearly the first half of the year has been encouraging with the demand cycle for Gas, both first and second quarter equipment orders grew north of 50%. We're also seeing the investments though, in the installed base with our services orders both growing double-digits in both the first and the second quarter. So, you're seeing the investment on both sides. I mean, we were intentional in our prepared remarks in the sense that as strong as those orders are on a year-over-year basis, with the pipeline we see, and it's a combination of US orders and global orders, we do expect the second half of the year to have more orders in the first half of the year. So first half of the year, we had 30 heavy-duty gas turbines with 12 HAs. Second half will be stronger based on what we see. But we're not in a place today that this is one transaction, one market. This is a general trend that just the realization of the need for more reliable power that's leading to increase demand into gas that's supporting us also having to invest in or gas to support that growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moses Sutton with BNP.\nMoses Sutton : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just continuing on the gas topic. How should we think of the eventual capacity constraints at Greenville and perhaps expanding the factory, especially as we know many utilities are signaling a further rise in CCGTs and peakers and so on? And then just to add to that how do you think about pricing of the gas turbines going forward and impact on margin relative to maybe historical razor blade model. Are you -- could you see something like 20% contribution margin on new gas turbines? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.\nScott Strazik : Thanks Moses. I'll start. I mean, if we had the benefit of having you visit Greenville with us you'd see that we have clear capacity to grow into this market in Greenville. But the challenge isn't going to be the Greenville factory. We're investing into single piece flow and lean lines that have given us a lot of physical capacity. We do have challenges and needs to work across our supply base and supply chain to gain access to more parts think castings and forgings. And we're going through that process right now. And that very well may lead to some investments we need to make to support this growth on a go-forward basis. But that's investments we'll make as the market tested results tell us to make those investments. But today we're not in a position that that's really our concern. I mean, we look at our slots we're pricing for the scar slots that we have. We do continue to see a healthier pricing environment for gas on orders that we'll book in 2024 into 2025 and that we'll convert into revenue approximately three years later. So we do see that over the medium to long-term as margin accretive to where the Power business segment goes. But again, these are equipment orders we're booking today at better margins that will convert three years from now.\nKen Parks : Yes. And just so you think about how we're managing through the required investments to support that we indicated in the prepared remarks that you should expect to see a little bit more CapEx coming through our numbers this year than maybe we had guided to not significantly different but a bit more. That's because these orders are on the books and we're trying to go ahead and get in place to get our capacity expanded as much as we can to support that. We're also working with our supply base to make sure our supply base is right there with us, so they can provide what we need to support those orders. I called that out, because correlating that to what we said about cash flow guidance, we took our cash flow guidance up nicely, not only just based upon the refund from the arbitration item on the legal dispute of about $300 million, but took it up by another $300 million on both ends of the range. And that is with that incremental capacity and CapEx that we're looking to invest again primarily in power, as well as trying to do things to help and keep our supply base where it needs to be. So it's a really good place to be in. But as Scott said, this is all for orders that we have on the books today, and we will continue to watch these order patterns as we move forward and try to make really good thoughtful decision. So we manage through the capital investments as well as the pricing environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Percoco : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just want to come back to the Electrification segment. You're obviously increasing the margin guidance this quarter for the full year at the Investor Day, you kind of laid out 500 basis points of margin upside based on what was already captured in the backlog as of the end of 2023. It seems like you're capturing half of that in 2024. So I'm just curious like what's driving that? Is that an accelerated conversion of the backlog? Is it better OpEx discipline or maybe just conservatism out of the gate at the Investor Day? And then maybe as a follow-up question to that. Can you just update us on what you're seeing come to the backlog today in terms of pricing relative to what you're recognizing in 2024? Thank you.\nScott Strazik : You bet. Andrew, thank you. At the start I think exactly as you said, we in March had a view of mid-single-digit margins for the year in Electrification. Now, the first half of the year has delivered mid-single-digit margins, so by default as we shift towards the full year now delivering high single-digit margins, that gives you an indication for how much stronger we expect the margin profile to be in the second half of this year, which will then be indicative of the margin profile and growth that we expect into 2025 and beyond. There was some level of caution on our part earlier in the year on how quickly we would fulfill and be able to ramp up into this growth. This is not a business that has experienced this substantial growth trajectory. And the team is doing a very good job. And frankly, as they do a very good job that's also giving us a little bit more confidence to invest into more growth with them and more capacity for them to manage this incredibly strong market that we have right now. Now, at the same time when you step back to our discussions in March, exactly as you said, we did accrete margin 500 basis points in the backlog last year, but we also said that over 50% of that backlog doesn't start to convert to revenue until 2026. So we're pleased to see the financial performance improve in 2024 and to get to this high single-digit number, we're just getting started here. I mean there's, a lot of opportunity to improve and a lot to be excited about in Electrification, but also a lot of work to do. So we sit here today in July with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence as we move forward.\nKen Parks: And to put a couple of finer points on it as you think about how this business is going to move. You heard us talk a lot in March not only in the electrification business, but all about doing an even stronger approach at underwriting these contracts, right? So as we even accreted the margin and backlog about 500 basis points it wasn't a matter of conservatism. As Scott said, it was a matter of this business kind of managing their execution to deliver even better margins than what we booked in backlog. So while some of that will flow out into later years what we're seeing is the execution on some of the contracts that are already in backlog we're actually landing at a better margin than what we thought that we contracted at. I give you that point, because it's not a market point it is an execution point. And I think you we want you to make sure and think about that business in the way that we are continuing to execute very well not just on the market side, but as well as how we're executing on these complicated projects. The second thing I would say is there are parts of the Electrification business that are not longer cycle, right? So some of the smaller components actually we take orders. And we may book within a few months. And because of the strength of that market the pricing that's coming through on those in the early parts of this year are going to flow out into better margins in the second half of the year. So it just supports everything that Scott said, but you've got a couple of finer points to think about how our execution sits.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nKen Parks: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good everybody. So my question is also on the heavy-duty gas turbine side. Orders were obviously great. And I guess I know all the work you've been doing to lean stuff out. That's probably not the easiest task in a kind of low volume -- low unit volume in a little bit of variable industry. So I'm a little bit curious, if there's a certain level that you can get to a real sort of process flow and really just how things consistent and predictable flowing? And what that level is if there's a margin impact when you really get to a steady state? And how large that could be for the segment if you're willing to talk about it? Thank you.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Rob. I mean, I'll start. There's clear opportunity. Although, yes, this is big pieces of infrastructure that we're building in our factories in Greenville. You can walk through that factory today. And if you had seen it five years ago to what it is today it doesn't resemble what it was. I mean we are -- I'm really proud of where we've gotten to with very high-tech single-piece flow that has eliminated an immense amount of rework in factories. We've got parts that move substantially less to the factory today because they just go on one single piece line from beginning to end as we build these gas turbines that have frankly freed up a lot of capacity in the factory to add a lot of services capacity into Greenville but frankly it also has created the capacity for us to grow into this better gas market without a need for anything other than leveraging our existing factories. So that's one of our real elements of arbitrage here because we have the industrial footprint. We have the cranes. The factories are attached to the railroads. We do have some P&E we're going to have to spend for some machinery. We're going to have to spend some money in partnership with some of our suppliers to support faster long lead items to meet this market, but this is work we know how to do. So Ken effectively laid out the fact that our free cash flow guide for this year is already incorporating some of those investments on orders that have already booked in the first half of the year. And as the order strength continues where it makes sense we'll continue to make more of those investments.\nKen Parks: Yes. And you asked a great question around the impact on ultimate margins, but as Scott just kind of leaned into the point is not only is it a margin impact. But as we continue to kind of moved down this lean journey and the gas power business is further along than most in our portfolio. It's also an optimizing of our working capital impact. So that flows straight to free cash flow. So even though we're going to invest a little bit more in CapEx early we know that that will bring us benefits on cash flow side and all of this runs down to better margins as well as better cash generation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore.\nScott Strazik: Good morning, James.\nJames West: Hey, good morning. Good morning, Scott. Good morning, Ken.\nScott Strazik: Good morning.\nJames West: I am curious Scott if you could maybe elaborate on your grid and grid infrastructure and transistor businesses because I think that's going to be a big area of growth. I know that you guys have historically been strong in Europe and the US, but I believe this is a much more global business than any of us actually realize. And so I love some commentary on the outlook and maybe some education on that business.\nScott Strazik: James, I appreciate it. I mean the reality is you're right. I mean historically this has been a more European-centric business. That is true. But as we framed up in the prepared remarks this is a business segment that saw our orders double over the course of the second quarter. So I think the reality is our Electrification segment in grid is the part of GE Vernova that's benefiting the most from Vernova. And what I mean by that is we're really able to lean in in a much more coordinated way on the front end of this business with our relationships on the Power and Wind side and are finding an ability to pull-through even more grid growth with very strong customer relationships in places like the US. And as one company and organized as one company where especially with things like key accounts we're driving another level of coordinated activity, we're starting to really bear fruit from that. When we think about the strategic sessions we're having with our customers, it is true that an electrification especially in the US, we're doing an education, even with our customers on what the art of the possible is. And it gives me that much more optimism that beyond the fact that this is a good market and a good global market, especially in the US, I have a lot of optimism with where this business is going. So you really have a conviction case in Europe where since the crisis in Ukraine, our European customers are spending at incredibly high levels to give themselves real -- another level of resiliency and energy independence that's driving grid growth. The US isn't growing as fast, but candidly, we have more arbitrage to lean into with the Vernova benefits that are helping us right now. And over the longer term, Asia is going to be an important market too. But this is very much a lot about Western Europe and North America. But those markets alone with customers we know very well and have very strong relationships, converging at a time where Philippe and the team are simply running this business a lot better are two converging factors that give us real possibility to create a business that we're very excited about here.\nKen Parks: And maybe just again, just to kind of give you a little bit of perspective on how to kind of think about where the numbers are. If you take HVDC and I'm going to talk about orders in the second quarter and it kind of holds for the first half as well. If you take HVDC orders kind of out of the order totals for Electrification, the remainder of the orders within the electrification business are fairly evenly spread across North America, Europe and rest of world. So we like that because while HVDC is coming in strong in Europe as Scott mentioned, the carry-on impact is really affecting all of the regions around the world. So this business is feeling much more balanced globally when you look at it in that perspective.\nMichael Lapides: Operator, we have time for one last question please.\nOperator: This question will come from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho.\nMaheep Mandloi: Hey. Can you guys hear me?\nScott Strazik: We can. Good morning.\nMaheep Mandloi: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the questions here. Just looking at the 10-Q, the product warranty liabilities reduced from $1.4 billion down $1.2 billion in the quarter. So just trying to understand what's driving that. And then in light of the AEP lawsuit and potential environmental liabilities and Massachusetts just how to think about where that number goes here? Thanks.\nKen Parks: Yeah. So it's a good question. I would just think about it this way. Really no fundamental change in warranties the way we're accruing warranties. The real difference right there Maheep is just the fact that as we take the portion of the steam business that we sold to EDF and take their balances off the books that made essentially that change in that warranty accrual. So there's really no other dynamics going on there. We're still accruing the same way. We're seeing the same kind of patterns of trends. So nothing of significance there outside of the disposition of that piece of that business.\nMichael Lapides: Before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott. Scott, closing comments?\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Everyone, we're excited about the trajectory of our company going forward. I do want to take a minute as we conclude the call and just thank our employees, our partners for their dedication and hard work and our customers for their continued trust in us. And thank you for your interest in GE Vernova.\nMichael Lapides: Thank you. We'll turn it back over to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Strazik",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion across all three segments and substantial improvement in free cash flow. Macro trends are continuing to create meaningful opportunities for us to lead in the energy transition. First, we're seeing increasing demand for power generation driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs and emerging data center needs. Second, there is a significant need for grid infrastructure investments to support both energy security and reliability goals. And third, our customers are investing to decarbonize their power systems, which drives demand for low and zero-carbon generation as well as new grid connections. We're serving this robust market demand while simultaneously running our businesses better, driving disciplined growth, margin expansion and higher free cash flow. Turning to slide 4. I'll spend a few minutes on each of our segments. Our Power segment led by Gas Power delivered growth in both equipment and high-margin services orders and revenue, while also achieving 180 basis points of margin expansion. Power orders increased 30% this quarter led by strength in equipment orders which more than doubled year-over-year. Notably we recently commissioned our 100th HA gas turbine in South Korea. The H-class fleet is an important source of growing services revenue and billings for our Power segment. In the second half of this year, we expect continued strength in orders with heavy-duty gas turbines including HA units to be higher versus first half 2024. Electrification is our fastest-growing segment. Profitable growth continues as customers modernize and invest in new products such as transformers and switch gears that are key to ensuring a reliable electricity system and connecting new generation sources. For example, orders more than doubled this quarter in North America which continues to be a key growth opportunity for this segment. Overall, the Electrification segment has grown its backlog by over 25% since the start of the year. I'm pleased with the team's progress on margins which expanded 360 basis points this quarter and I have conviction we can drive significant margin expansion given the electrification segment's strong demand and strong industry pricing dynamics. We are thoughtfully investing to increase our output levels for this rising demand. For example, we are almost doubling capacity our Stafford facility in the UK to deliver HVDC transformers. Right now, Wind remains the most challenging segment. While we grew onshore backlog in the quarter we remain cautious on the timing of an inflection in onshore orders as customers navigate the challenges that come with permitting new projects and higher interest rates. We are nearly two years into our Onshore Wind quality improvement program and we are making progress with no new significant issues identified. We continue to look for ways to implement the improvements into our existing fleet at a faster pace. In order to deliver for customers, we are adding crews to the field and gaining access to more cranes to accelerate our work. For our new units, we are leveraging technologies including our blade inspection robot to enhance our manufacturing process. At Offshore, we have converted almost $800 million of our backlog to revenue in the first half of the year. Last week, we had a turbine blade event at our Vineyard Wind project. The turbine was shut down safely and no one was injured. With safety always as a top priority, we are working with our customer and the appropriate agencies to determine the root cause and then implement corrective actions and a restart plan. While we continue to work to finalize our root cause analysis, our investigation to date indicates that the affected blade experience a manufacturing deviation. We have not identified information indicating an engineering design flaw in the blade or information of a connection with the blade event we experienced in an Offshore Wind project in the U.K., which was caused by an installation error out at sea. We are working with urgency to scrutinize our operations across Offshore Wind. Pace matters here, but we are going to be thorough instead of rushed. Going forward, we remain highly selective on potential offshore win new orders, focused on achieving substantially higher pricing, and disciplined commercial terms. In the Wind segment overall this quarter, we expanded margins by 400 basis points and see opportunities for further expansion. We still expect the Wind segment to approach profitability this year and become profitable in 2025. Longer term, wind should play a critical role in the energy transition. Now, over to the right side of the page. We are driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery, and cost. On safety, after 10 consecutive months of fatality-free operations, June was a tough month for us. An employee of ours in Malaysia lost his life driving to a work site in his personal car and a one car accident on a public road and a contractor working in our direction in Turkey lost his life with an arc flash event at a wind farm. Safety will always be the top priority at GE Vernova in both events reinforce our need to continue to get better to ensure our employees and contractors return home at the end of work. Turning to Quality, where we are always working to improve our outcomes for our customers. For example in a year where gas outages increased double-digits, our team has reduced quality deviations by 15% from live outage, our lean-enabled digital outage platform that reduces cycle-times and improve the field execution experience for our customers. We are also using lean to improve delivery. In Electrification, the team in France recently executed a series of Kaizens tackling material flow, scheduling, and increasing capacity. As a result of the new processes we implemented, one of the production cells increased its output of certain switchgear components by 135% from 17 per week to more than 40 per week, helping to drive the growth we are seeing in our electrification segment and ultimately, improving outcomes for our customers. Finally, we are using lean to simplify our operations and reduce G&A costs. We are focusing on reducing our G&A and driving productivity at our corporate center and in our segments. We began executing cost-out initiatives in the second quarter that give me increased confidence in our ability to realize G&A reductions in 2025. Turning to the next slide for a look into our strong second quarter financial performance. Orders were robust with 2Q 2024 marking the second largest order quarter we've delivered over the last three years and we saw healthy equipment backlog growth across multiple businesses, especially in Gas Power and Grid. We delivered disciplined top line growth led by the strength in price and services volume. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points with expansion across all segments. Notably, we generated positive free cash flow with an over $1 billion improvement year-over-year as well as sequentially and ended the second quarter with a $5.8 billion cash balance. We are raising our 2024 guidance and now expect revenue to trend towards the higher end of our $34 billion to $35 billion range largely on Electrification. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be 5% to 7%, up from previous expectations of the higher end of mid-single digits. The improvement is driven by Power, which we now expect will deliver 150 to 200 basis points of organic margin expansion and Electrification where we expect high single-digit margins. We are also raising our 2024 free cash flow guidance. We expect to deliver between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion up from the prior $700 million to $1.1 billion range. Overall, with continued demand growth further margin expansion and strong free cash flow, we feel confident about the momentum in our business for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Ken for more details on our second quarter performance and our latest guidance. Thanks, Ken. All in we are pleased with our performance in the first half of this year and we are excited about our future as we help our customers electrify and decarbonize the world. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi-decade growth for GE Vernova. Our Power segment generates 70% of its revenues from services. We expect power to drive expanded margins with growing free cash flow for a number of years. We expect to continue expanding margins in Wind and to benefit when demand for new Wind units especially in North America ramps further. In Electrification, we are seeing customers significantly increase grid-related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero carbon power sources. We expect this segment to also continue to deliver higher margins in the years to come. Our lean operating system sustainability and innovation remain at the core of our company. We are running our businesses better and are well positioned as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the coming years. And when we put all this together we see a clear opportunity to deliver substantial value for our stakeholders going forward. With that I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call. Mark, thanks for the question. It's been 11 days since the event. Just to reinforce at the start, we have no indications of an engineering design flaw that's important at the beginning. As we said in the prepared remarks, we have identified a material deviation or a manufacturing deviation in one of our factories that through the inspection or quality assurance process, we should have identified. Because of that, we're going to use our existing data and reinspect all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind and for context in this factory in Gaspe\u0301, Canada where the material deviation existed, we've made about 150 blades, so that gives you an indication and context of the work ahead. But to be clear, this is work we know how to do. I mean the industry uses non-destructive testing, think ultrasound, think a radiologist, but for a blade to identify deviations. We are going to go and do this on every blade, prudent thorough process. We're not going to talk about the time line today. We have work to do, but I have a high degree of confidence that we can do this, and we'll do it in support of both the customer and the agency and move forward from there. On your question on kind of deliveries and timing, I would just frame up a few things. I mean, clearly, while we're on pause right now, there's risk to some collections moving from 2024 into 2025. And that is embedded into our financial guidance here for what we framed up and we're really taking the path forward. Now, on Dogger Bank, we continue to install and commission wind turbines right now, and we intend to continue to do that. We're in close contact with SSC, and we continue to progress on that project today. Good morning, Andy. Yeah. We are. I mean, we're still consistent with our financial framing of approaching profitability in 2024 in the segment with high single-digit onshore wind margins in 2024 and the segment turning profitable in 2025, Andy. What I would just emphasize is we -- 2024 and 2025 as we've been framing up for a period of time are two more difficult years for us and win relative to the dynamics we have in the other segments. But we remain confident in that framework for 2024 and 2025. And then when you look at the orders pipeline that we see, it's just tough for us to call when it starts to convert into orders, we still see the possibility that we could see those orders come through in 2025 that leads to a revenue inflection point in 2026 on onshore at the exact same time that we'll still be materially through our Offshore Wind backlog. So 2024 and 2025 is going to be very consistent with what we've talked about. And then you're really playing through to 2026, where we see the real possibility for margins to accrete substantially as we have the potential for some Onshore Wind growth and Offshore Wind becomes a smaller proportion of the total revenue guide. Can you please repeat the question team? We're having an audio challenge here in the room? Good morning, Joe. Thanks, Joe. I mean clearly the first half of the year has been encouraging with the demand cycle for Gas, both first and second quarter equipment orders grew north of 50%. We're also seeing the investments though, in the installed base with our services orders both growing double-digits in both the first and the second quarter. So, you're seeing the investment on both sides. I mean, we were intentional in our prepared remarks in the sense that as strong as those orders are on a year-over-year basis, with the pipeline we see, and it's a combination of US orders and global orders, we do expect the second half of the year to have more orders in the first half of the year. So first half of the year, we had 30 heavy-duty gas turbines with 12 HAs. Second half will be stronger based on what we see. But we're not in a place today that this is one transaction, one market. This is a general trend that just the realization of the need for more reliable power that's leading to increase demand into gas that's supporting us also having to invest in or gas to support that growth. Thanks Moses. I'll start. I mean, if we had the benefit of having you visit Greenville with us you'd see that we have clear capacity to grow into this market in Greenville. But the challenge isn't going to be the Greenville factory. We're investing into single piece flow and lean lines that have given us a lot of physical capacity. We do have challenges and needs to work across our supply base and supply chain to gain access to more parts think castings and forgings. And we're going through that process right now. And that very well may lead to some investments we need to make to support this growth on a go-forward basis. But that's investments we'll make as the market tested results tell us to make those investments. But today we're not in a position that that's really our concern. I mean, we look at our slots we're pricing for the scar slots that we have. We do continue to see a healthier pricing environment for gas on orders that we'll book in 2024 into 2025 and that we'll convert into revenue approximately three years later. So we do see that over the medium to long-term as margin accretive to where the Power business segment goes. But again, these are equipment orders we're booking today at better margins that will convert three years from now. You bet. Andrew, thank you. At the start I think exactly as you said, we in March had a view of mid-single-digit margins for the year in Electrification. Now, the first half of the year has delivered mid-single-digit margins, so by default as we shift towards the full year now delivering high single-digit margins, that gives you an indication for how much stronger we expect the margin profile to be in the second half of this year, which will then be indicative of the margin profile and growth that we expect into 2025 and beyond. There was some level of caution on our part earlier in the year on how quickly we would fulfill and be able to ramp up into this growth. This is not a business that has experienced this substantial growth trajectory. And the team is doing a very good job. And frankly, as they do a very good job that's also giving us a little bit more confidence to invest into more growth with them and more capacity for them to manage this incredibly strong market that we have right now. Now, at the same time when you step back to our discussions in March, exactly as you said, we did accrete margin 500 basis points in the backlog last year, but we also said that over 50% of that backlog doesn't start to convert to revenue until 2026. So we're pleased to see the financial performance improve in 2024 and to get to this high single-digit number, we're just getting started here. I mean there's, a lot of opportunity to improve and a lot to be excited about in Electrification, but also a lot of work to do. So we sit here today in July with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence as we move forward. Thanks, Rob. I mean, I'll start. There's clear opportunity. Although, yes, this is big pieces of infrastructure that we're building in our factories in Greenville. You can walk through that factory today. And if you had seen it five years ago to what it is today it doesn't resemble what it was. I mean we are -- I'm really proud of where we've gotten to with very high-tech single-piece flow that has eliminated an immense amount of rework in factories. We've got parts that move substantially less to the factory today because they just go on one single piece line from beginning to end as we build these gas turbines that have frankly freed up a lot of capacity in the factory to add a lot of services capacity into Greenville but frankly it also has created the capacity for us to grow into this better gas market without a need for anything other than leveraging our existing factories. So that's one of our real elements of arbitrage here because we have the industrial footprint. We have the cranes. The factories are attached to the railroads. We do have some P&E we're going to have to spend for some machinery. We're going to have to spend some money in partnership with some of our suppliers to support faster long lead items to meet this market, but this is work we know how to do. So Ken effectively laid out the fact that our free cash flow guide for this year is already incorporating some of those investments on orders that have already booked in the first half of the year. And as the order strength continues where it makes sense we'll continue to make more of those investments. Good morning, James. Good morning. James, I appreciate it. I mean the reality is you're right. I mean historically this has been a more European-centric business. That is true. But as we framed up in the prepared remarks this is a business segment that saw our orders double over the course of the second quarter. So I think the reality is our Electrification segment in grid is the part of GE Vernova that's benefiting the most from Vernova. And what I mean by that is we're really able to lean in in a much more coordinated way on the front end of this business with our relationships on the Power and Wind side and are finding an ability to pull-through even more grid growth with very strong customer relationships in places like the US. And as one company and organized as one company where especially with things like key accounts we're driving another level of coordinated activity, we're starting to really bear fruit from that. When we think about the strategic sessions we're having with our customers, it is true that an electrification especially in the US, we're doing an education, even with our customers on what the art of the possible is. And it gives me that much more optimism that beyond the fact that this is a good market and a good global market, especially in the US, I have a lot of optimism with where this business is going. So you really have a conviction case in Europe where since the crisis in Ukraine, our European customers are spending at incredibly high levels to give themselves real -- another level of resiliency and energy independence that's driving grid growth. The US isn't growing as fast, but candidly, we have more arbitrage to lean into with the Vernova benefits that are helping us right now. And over the longer term, Asia is going to be an important market too. But this is very much a lot about Western Europe and North America. But those markets alone with customers we know very well and have very strong relationships, converging at a time where Philippe and the team are simply running this business a lot better are two converging factors that give us real possibility to create a business that we're very excited about here. We can. Good morning. Thanks, Michael. Everyone, we're excited about the trajectory of our company going forward. I do want to take a minute as we conclude the call and just thank our employees, our partners for their dedication and hard work and our customers for their continued trust in us. And thank you for your interest in GE Vernova."

            "name": "Ken Parks",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Let's turn to Slide 6. As already stated, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with EBITDA margin expansion across all three segments and positive free cash flow generation. Demand remains robust as orders reached nearly $12 billion which Scott mentioned was our second largest orders quarter in the last three years, and approximately 1.4x second quarter revenue. Power equipment orders more than doubled and total services orders grew double-digits with strength in Power and Electrification. Due to large Offshore Wind and HVDC equipment orders booked in the second quarter of last year, orders were 7% lower year-over-year. Our backlog remains sizable at $115 billion, including the impact of the recently completed divestiture of a portion of steam power to EDF. Importantly, equipment margin and backlog remains healthy in line with our disciplined profitable growth priority. Revenue grew 2% with continued strength in electrification and power, partially offset by Wind. Services revenue remained solid, increasing 9% with growth across all segments. In addition, all three segments benefited from positive price again this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 85% driving 320 basis points of margin expansion. All segments delivered more than 150 basis points of expansion in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, price and services volume which more than offset inflationary impacts. In addition, we continue to benefit from our previously announced restructuring actions largely at Wind and Power. We delivered over $800 million of positive free cash flow improving more than $1 billion both sequentially and year-over-year from working capital and higher adjusted EBITDA partially offset by higher cash taxes. Working capital was an approximately $760 million benefit in the quarter, improving over $700 million year-over-year due primarily to strong collections. In the quarter, we received an approximately $300 million refund resulting from a positive arbitration decision in an open multiemployer pension plan dispute which is included in free cash flow. The P&L benefit of approximately $250 million was recorded in SG&A and was excluded from adjusted SG&A and adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as a result of completing the sale of a portion of steam power, we received approximately $600 million of net proceeds, which are classified outside of free cash flow and recognized an almost $900 million pre-tax gain in the quarter which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The combination of free cash flow generation and proceeds from divestitures increased our already solid cash balance to $5.8 billion. Overall, we're encouraged by our financial performance in the first half of 2024 with organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of nearly 400 basis points and positive free cash flow generation. Now turning to Power on slide 7. The segment delivered another strong quarter with double-digit orders growth, solid revenue growth and further EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 30%, led by higher equipment at Gas Power and Hydro power. During the second quarter, Gas Power equipment orders increased over 60% as we booked 14 heavy-duty gas turbines, which included four HA units compared to no HA unit bookings in 2023 second quarter. Power Services orders grew 12%, driven by Gas Power. Revenue grew 10% on higher gas service volumes. Equipment revenue also increased from Gas Power strength. EBITDA increased 24%, resulting in 180 basis points of margin expansion as higher services volume, productivity and price more than offset the impact of inflation. Looking ahead, we see increased demand for gas as a reliable source of baseload generation, which is resulting in incremental growth opportunities for both Gas equipment and Gas services over the medium to long-term. We anticipate additional 2024 CapEx at power to fulfill demand on gas orders that are already booked, and we continue to evaluate strategies to meet potential additional demand acceleration. Turning to Wind, we continued making progress in driving improved EBITDA despite lower revenue levels. Orders declined 44%, given the tough comparison to the second quarter of last year, when a large offshore equipment order was booked. As a reminder, that offshore order was later canceled by the customer in the fourth quarter of 2023. Onshore equipment orders declined 11%, but increased more than 2.5 times sequentially from the first quarter. As Scott indicated earlier, we remain cautious on the timing of an onshore order inflection in North America as customers navigate growing interconnection queues and higher interest rates. Revenue decreased 20% from lower onshore equipment deliveries, partially offset by higher offshore revenue as we continue to execute on our offshore equipment backlog. EBITDA margins improved 400 basis points versus the prior year from positive price and continued cost reductions. At offshore, EBITDA losses decreased, and onshore margins improved despite lower volume, remaining profitable again in the second quarter. Wind is demonstrating signs of financial progress. We continue our work at both onshore and offshore to drive incremental cost leverage. In the second half of 2024, we expect to further improve EBITDA on meaningfully higher onshore equipment volume at better margins, which are currently in our existing backlog. Now at electrification, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders were $4.8 billion, roughly 2.7 times second quarter revenue and over 30% higher sequentially. While remaining strong, second quarter orders declined year-over-year due to significantly higher HVDC orders recorded in the prior year. Within Grid Solutions, we saw strong orders growth in the US, particularly for high-voltage switchgears and circuit breakers. Revenue grew 19% with strength in equipment led by Grid Solutions and Power Conversion. EBITDA margin expanded 360 basis points on volume, price and productivity. All of our electrification businesses were profitable in the second quarter, and expanded margins both year over year and sequentially. We continue to see strong demand and price resulting in electrification revenue growth and meaningful EBITDA margin expansion. Equipment backlog in this segment increased to approximately $17 billion, up $5 billion compared to the second quarter of 2023, with healthy margins. Turning to slide 10. Largely based upon our strong first half performance, we're raising our full year 2024 guidance. For revenue, we're now trending towards the high end of our original $34 billion to $35 billion guidance range, mostly due to additional Electrification strength. We're also increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of 5% to 7%. By segment, we maintain our power revenue guidance, but now anticipate approximately 150 to 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion compared to our previous guide of approximately 100 basis points driven mainly by Gas Power strength. At Wind, we still expect revenue to be essentially flat year-over-year and to approach profitability this year from positive price productivity and cost savings. In the second half the timing of turbine shipments as well as cost could drive some variability in wind results. In Electrification, we're increasing our revenue growth guidance from low double digits to mid- to high teens based on continued strong demand and favorable price. Given our higher revenue growth expectations we now expect electrification to achieve high single-digit EBITDA margins in 2024 compared to our previous expectation of mid-single digits. As a result of the higher EBITDA outlook along with the strong cash performance and the nonrecurring arbitration refund in the first half of 2024 we're also increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. This includes slightly higher expected CapEx investments primarily to fulfill significant gas power orders booked so far this year. Looking specifically at the third quarter we expect solid year-over-year revenue growth and continued EBITDA margin expansion across the segments. Relative to last year's third quarter we anticipate power top line growth from higher gas equipment and services revenue and EBITDA margin expansion versus last year from volume productivity and pricing. Wind revenue is expected to grow meaningfully year-over-year as we deliver higher-margin onshore volume out of backlog. In addition EBITDA should improve from the higher onshore volume along with positive price and lower cost structure. At Electrification, we expect solid top line growth along with margin expansion from higher volume productivity and favorable pricing. In the third quarter note that like in most years the seasonality of outages and services revenue at Gas Power means lower adjusted EBITDA on a sequential basis for GE Vernova. We expect free cash flow to improve year-over-year driven by the stronger adjusted EBITDA. Sequentially, we anticipate free cash flow to decrease largely from the lower adjusted EBITDA slightly higher CapEx and cash taxes as well as the nonrecurring arbitration refund received in the second quarter. We're very encouraged by the momentum we built in the first half of the year. We're also confident in the strength of our balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating as we evaluate opportunities for growth and return of capital to shareholders. With that I'll turn it back to Scott. Good morning. Yeah. And the one thing I would add, I think it's the right question around thinking about 2025, but also remember that as we're moving through the second half of 2024, we called out an Onshore Wind in the backlog as of the end of 2023 that we had expanded our margin within that backlog by about 10 full points. Some of that will begin to deliver in 2024 in the second half, which gives us confidence in the statements that we made, and that Scott just reiterated about our outlook and approaching profitability for the year for Wind overall. But some of that accretion and backlog will deliver in 2025. So part of the step-up in 2025, as you asked about, will be incremental Wind orders coming in the second half. But a piece of that is already in our backlog and we will deliver on it as we move into the year. Yes. So we would tell you that in the -- let's start with the Wind, because I think it's important as we're also -- I gave you the 2023 number, what's happening as we move into 2024. We had seen Wind margin backlogs accrete and grow as, call it, the last 12 to 18 months as we move towards the end of 2023. What we're seeing in orders that we're taking in now is that better pricing is actually staying at kind of those levels as we move through the first half of the year. So, it's moved up and it's kind of staying at those levels. Now the difference is to where you asked about on Power and Electrification. As those demand patterns have continued to grow, what we've seen is the pricing environment has continued to get stronger versus where we ended 2023, both in Power and Electrification. And a point of reference is on Electrification, we had talked about for overall Electrification equipment at the end of 2023, our margins and backlog had expanded 5-full points. And so we're seeing that continue to grow as we move over time and any quarter point can have a little bit of volatility to it, but the pricing dynamic within Electrification continuing to get better, booking better, stronger profitable orders and backlog. And obviously, the same thing on the Power dynamics, as you see the really strong orders coming on to the books. Good morning. Yes. And just so you think about how we're managing through the required investments to support that we indicated in the prepared remarks that you should expect to see a little bit more CapEx coming through our numbers this year than maybe we had guided to not significantly different but a bit more. That's because these orders are on the books and we're trying to go ahead and get in place to get our capacity expanded as much as we can to support that. We're also working with our supply base to make sure our supply base is right there with us, so they can provide what we need to support those orders. I called that out, because correlating that to what we said about cash flow guidance, we took our cash flow guidance up nicely, not only just based upon the refund from the arbitration item on the legal dispute of about $300 million, but took it up by another $300 million on both ends of the range. And that is with that incremental capacity and CapEx that we're looking to invest again primarily in power, as well as trying to do things to help and keep our supply base where it needs to be. So it's a really good place to be in. But as Scott said, this is all for orders that we have on the books today, and we will continue to watch these order patterns as we move forward and try to make really good thoughtful decision. So we manage through the capital investments as well as the pricing environment. And to put a couple of finer points on it as you think about how this business is going to move. You heard us talk a lot in March not only in the electrification business, but all about doing an even stronger approach at underwriting these contracts, right? So as we even accreted the margin and backlog about 500 basis points it wasn't a matter of conservatism. As Scott said, it was a matter of this business kind of managing their execution to deliver even better margins than what we booked in backlog. So while some of that will flow out into later years what we're seeing is the execution on some of the contracts that are already in backlog we're actually landing at a better margin than what we thought that we contracted at. I give you that point, because it's not a market point it is an execution point. And I think you we want you to make sure and think about that business in the way that we are continuing to execute very well not just on the market side, but as well as how we're executing on these complicated projects. The second thing I would say is there are parts of the Electrification business that are not longer cycle, right? So some of the smaller components actually we take orders. And we may book within a few months. And because of the strength of that market the pricing that's coming through on those in the early parts of this year are going to flow out into better margins in the second half of the year. So it just supports everything that Scott said, but you've got a couple of finer points to think about how our execution sits. Good morning, Rob. Yes. And you asked a great question around the impact on ultimate margins, but as Scott just kind of leaned into the point is not only is it a margin impact. But as we continue to kind of moved down this lean journey and the gas power business is further along than most in our portfolio. It's also an optimizing of our working capital impact. So that flows straight to free cash flow. So even though we're going to invest a little bit more in CapEx early we know that that will bring us benefits on cash flow side and all of this runs down to better margins as well as better cash generation. And maybe just again, just to kind of give you a little bit of perspective on how to kind of think about where the numbers are. If you take HVDC and I'm going to talk about orders in the second quarter and it kind of holds for the first half as well. If you take HVDC orders kind of out of the order totals for Electrification, the remainder of the orders within the electrification business are fairly evenly spread across North America, Europe and rest of world. So we like that because while HVDC is coming in strong in Europe as Scott mentioned, the carry-on impact is really affecting all of the regions around the world. So this business is feeling much more balanced globally when you look at it in that perspective. Yeah. So it's a good question. I would just think about it this way. Really no fundamental change in warranties the way we're accruing warranties. The real difference right there Maheep is just the fact that as we take the portion of the steam business that we sold to EDF and take their balances off the books that made essentially that change in that warranty accrual. So there's really no other dynamics going on there. We're still accruing the same way. We're seeing the same kind of patterns of trends. So nothing of significance there outside of the disposition of that piece of that business."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to GE Vernova's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Michael Lapides, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nMichael Lapides: Thank you. Welcome to GE Vernova's first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Scott Strazik; and our CFO, Ken Parks. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically do not have any obligation to do so. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. With that, I'll hand the call over to Scott.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call after successfully completing our launch as an independent company on April 2nd. We delivered solid results in the first quarter. I'm pleased with how we are executing on the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day on March 6th. We're excited about the opportunity ahead for GE Vernova, a purpose built company to electrify and decarbonize the world. Even in the last seven weeks since our Investor Day, the drumbeat of dialogue is only growing louder with the customers and policymakers on the challenges and opportunities ahead to meet growing demand, while accelerating our decarbonization pathway. These macro trends are creating real opportunities for us to continue to lead in the energy transition, while we are running our businesses better, driving disciplined growth, margin expansion, and higher free cash flow. If we shift to the left hand side of the page, lean remains at our core, driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery, and cost. And as we do with most of our meetings at GE Vernova, I want to start today on safety. Our focus here is driving real results with our injury and illness rate improving 5% over the last 12 months. We have had no fatalities year-to-date and we'll always run GE Vernova with safety as the top priority to ensure every employee, contractor, and partner we work with goes home safely each day. To give a little more color on lean, we executed on over 800 Kaizen events in Q1 '24 alone. And I'd like to share with you an example of the progress we are making with one of the Kaizen events where I participated for three days in January in our grid automation business in Ontario, Canada. Grid automation is an important business inside electrification that provides protection and controls for electrical substations on the grid in addition to solutions for monitoring and diagnostics for essential electrical equipment like transformers and breakers. This business is experiencing double digit top-line growth, but still has parts of its supply chain using batch processing for inventory. At the Kaizen event, three teams executed on transforming batch processing of generator protection panels into a lean line with single piece flow, focusing on pre-wiring activity first. Since the Kaizen event in January, we've seen our work in progress inventory reduced by over 50%, output has increased 15%, and we've decreased the distance parts traveled to site by roughly 80% for this pre-wiring. This is just one example of what is happening every week across GE Vernova to enable us to decrease delivery times, increase output, and lower costs, ultimately improving outcomes for our customers. In addition to embedding lean within our facilities, we are also using lean to simplify our business operations and reduce our costs. Our Q1 G&A growing versus Q1 '23 is not one of the areas our leadership team is happy about as we sit here in April, but our expenses now reflect the additional costs of our standup as a public company, as well as the cost transferred from GE corporate on IT, finance, and HR. We are laser focused on action with urgency, leveraging lean to eliminate waste in our G&A processes. Now I'd like to spend a minute on the right hand side of the page. On our three business segment trends and the markets they serve. Our power businesses, led by Gas Power and the over 7,000 gas turbines in the fleet are continuing to see strong uptick in demand. Our utilization of the gas fleet depending on geography is growing low-single digits, driving continued strength in our high margin services business. In addition, with expected increases in electricity demand growth in the coming years, along with a continued shift away from coal, interest in adding incremental gas capacity is growing. Customers are focused on how capacity additions this decade can be decarbonized in the next decade with both hydrogen and carbon capture. Gas Power Services orders increased double-digits in the first quarter and equipment orders grew 75% versus last year, showing the robust demand for services into our installed base and trends for new gas capacity. We are accelerating our focus and our strategy working with our supply chain partners on how to potentially create incremental capacity to meet this growing demand. I along with others on the leadership team are spending time with the team in Greenville in a few weeks to focus specifically on this. Turning to Wind, we continue to expand margins as we improve this business, benefiting from a better onshore wind backlog in a lower cost structure in total. Even in a very low volume Q1 with just over a 1 billion of onshore wind revenue, the onshore wind business still delivered positive EBITDA for the third straight quarter. As discussed at 4Q earnings, we expect second half revenue will be substantially higher than first half revenue with a larger North America mix. While we remain cautious on the exact timing of significant onshore wind orders growth in the U.S., as our customers navigate the challenges that come with permitting new projects. We are very excited about where this business performance can go as the orders and revenue accelerate in the medium term. In offshore, we are working through our existing backlog, and while believe offshore is key to the energy transition, we will remain highly selective on new orders. Finally, electrification, our fastest growing segment, profitable growth continues to accelerate as customers modernize and invest in the grid. Significant demand exists for a number of our products such as transformers and switch gears, products key to ensuring a reliable electricity system and for connecting new generation. Orders this quarter were over 2x revenue, which we expect will drive revenue and profit growth well into the future, given healthy margins on what we added to backlog. Of our three business segments, electrification is the one where we have the best opportunity to challenge ourselves on both growth and margins we can achieve in the medium term, given this segment has the strongest demand and pricing dynamics. Turning now to our first quarter performance, where we delivered a solid start to the year. We will continue to be disciplined on our top-line growth. And Q1 had orders down 1% and organic revenue growth of 5% versus the prior year. Our backlog continued to grow up over $8 billion compared to Q1 '23 with healthy margins. Overall, we expanded margins increasing almost 500 basis points. All three segments improved margins driven by price, productivity and continued cost reductions combined with high-single digit services growth. In the quarter, we improved free cash flow compared to last year and expect a meaningful acceleration in cash flow as we move through the year. We are reaffirming the guidance provided at Investor Day in March. For more details around that and our first quarter performance, I will turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Parks: Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 5, I'll speak to our results on an organic and adjusted basis, which best represents the underlying performance of our business. As Scott mentioned, we delivered solid results with significant EBITDA margin expansion in each of our segments and continued improvement in free cash flow. Orders reached $9.7 billion and were approximately 1.3x first quarter revenue further expanding our backlog to $116 billion. Year-over-year orders declined slightly as lower equipment orders in wind and electrification more than offset strong equipment orders in power and double-digit growth in total service orders. Importantly, we continue to drive our strategy focused on disciplined profitable growth. As a result, equipment margin and backlog remained healthy. Revenue grew 5% with strength in Electrification and Power, partially offset by lower revenue in wind. Services were strong, growing 8% led by Power. All three segments benefited from positive price in the quarter. EBITDA margins expanded 470 basis points year-over-year with all segments delivering at least 300 basis points of expansion in the quarter. The first quarter expansion includes the impact of standalone cost in line with our expectation. These costs are not included in the prior year results. Margin expansion was driven by price, productivity and volume. We also continue to benefit from our announced restructuring actions, which together these more than offset inflation and higher R&D investments. The first quarter is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter, followed by sequentially improving quarters as the year progresses. While we had a net outflow of $661 million this was an approximately $150 million improvement over last year and was largely driven by improved earnings, partially offset by higher working capital outflows. Working capital was an approximately $500 million outflow in the quarter, driven by inventory build as we prepare to deliver second half volume along with higher disbursements, partially due to settlements of payables with GE in preparation for the spin. Increased milestone collections on equipment projects partially offset these outflows. Turning to Power on Slide 6, the segment delivered strong first quarter results with orders and revenue growth as well as EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 24%, led by higher equipment orders at Gas Power. During the first quarter, we booked eight HA gas turbine orders, four more than the same quarter last year and equal to HA orders in the full-year of 2023. We also booked orders for 18 aeroderivative units. Services grew low-double digits driven by gas. Revenue grew 4%, higher outages drove gas services growth along with favorable price. EBITDA nearly doubled and grew over 60% organically with 340 basis points of margin expansion as higher margin services volume along with price and productivity more than offset the impact of inflation. We're off to a good start in Power. Our gas fleet utilization has been trending higher this year, up low-single digits, benefiting from continued coal to gas switching and the increased demand for reliable and dispatchable power. We'll continue to evaluate strategies to meet a potential further acceleration in Gas Power demand as the outlook solidifies. Turning to Wind, we continue to make good progress on our turnaround driving improved EBITDA even at lower revenue levels. Orders declined 40% largely attributable to lower onshore orders. We remain focused on disciplined profitable growth in selected geographic areas such as North America, where our scale and strong manufacturing footprint provides advantages to our customers. Importantly, we see North American developers rebuilding their project pipeline as evidenced by the growing onshore interconnection queues. Revenue declined 7% from lower onshore equipment volume, partially offset by higher offshore equipment deliveries as we continue to execute on our offshore backlog. Wind services increased over 20%, driven by higher onshore parts sales in the U.S. EBITDA margins improved 400 basis points versus the prior year from continued cost reductions and positive price. Onshore EBITDA was positive for the third consecutive quarter, while offshore which still generated loss improved sequentially. Wind results are demonstrating clear signs of progress. We're integrating onshore and offshore centered around three key workhorse products, which is resulting in improved quality, better availability and incremental cost savings. Combined with higher second half onshore volume projections based on our existing backlog, we anticipate improving profitability as we move through the year. At Electrification, we had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders were strong at $3.6 billion more than 2x first quarter revenue, although 10% lower year-over-year given the large tenant HVDC orders recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Within Grid Solutions, the largest business in our Electrification segment, we saw increased demand for high voltage switchgear equipment and transformers, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Revenue grew 21% with strength in equipment, led by growth in Grid Solutions across the business. Segment EBITDA margin expanded approximately 600 basis points driven by volume, productivity and price. Grid Solutions generated another quarter of positive EBITDA and continued improvement year-over-year. Strong demand is driving continued electrification revenue growth. EBITDA margins are expanding as a result of the volume growth along with favorable pricing and productivity. Equipment backlog in this segment is up $6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2023 with healthy margins. Turning to Slide 9, based upon our solid start to the year, we're reaffirming our guidance provided at our Investor Day last month. For full-year 2024, we continue to forecast revenue in the $34 billion to $35 billion range with adjusted EBITDA margin at the high end of mid-single-digits. We expect free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $1.1 billion. Following our outflow in the first quarter, this implies free cash flow of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion over the balance of the year with continued improvement as we move through each of the three quarters ahead. By segment, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Power, driven by higher gas services and equipment with approximately 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. In wind, we expect revenue to be essentially flat and to approach profitability from positive price, productivity and cost savings. As previously noted, we anticipate higher U.S. onshore volume in the second half compared to the first and expect that to drive full-year onshore EBITDA margins to high-single-digits. In electrification, we anticipate continuing strong demand and favorable price to drive low double-digit organic revenue growth with mid-single-digit margins due to the higher volume and price, as well as productivity benefits. In addition, our 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance anticipates $300 million to $350 million of corporate and other costs, which includes approximately $200 million of incremental standalone costs. Looking specifically at the second quarter, we expect modest year-over-year top line growth and continued EBITDA margin expansion across the segments. Relative to last year's second quarter, Power should grow its top line from higher equipment and services revenue. EBITDA margins should benefit from the volume and pricing growth as well as ongoing productivity. Wind revenue is expected to decline, but EBITDA should further improve as we see the positive impact from better pricing and reduced costs. Electrification should continue to deliver strong top line growth along with improved margins from favorable pricing, higher volume and resulting productivity. We expect continued free cash flow improvement year-over-year in the second quarter. Year-over-year favorability is anticipated to be better than what we delivered in the first quarter as we continue to execute on our working capital velocity improvement actions. We're very encouraged with the solid financial performance to start the year. We see continued healthy demand for our products and services and our execution is driving stronger EBITDA margins and increased free cash flow. We're also confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Upon launch on April 2nd, our cash balance was $4.2 billion and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. With that, let me turn it back to Scott.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Ken. All in, we are pleased with our momentum to start the year. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi decade growth across Power, Wind and Electrification segments, whether it's helping our customers meet rising electricity demand, to decarbonize their systems, or to modernize and expand the grid, we are uniquely positioned to support their needs. Our Power segment generates 70% of its revenues from services as we support our large installed base that drives strong, consistent and growing free cash flow. Wind is a key part of the energy transition, representing only 7% of the world's electricity today. By 2040, wind will need to be close to 25% in order for the world to achieve its decarbonization goals. We expect to continue expanding margins in wind. Our Electrification segment is our highest growth business and margins and backlog continue to rise. We are seeing customers significantly increase planned grid related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero carbon power sources. As discussed earlier, our lean operating system, sustainability and innovation are the core of our company. We are committed to driving sustainability and to help customers advance their efforts to deliver on electrification and decarbonization. We are running our businesses better and benefiting from increasing demand as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing EBITDA and free cash flow for a long time. And when we put all this together, we see a clear opportunity to create substantial value for all stakeholders going forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call.\nMichael Lapides: Thank you, Scott. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Please return to the queue, if you have follow-ups. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.\nMark Strouse: Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for taking our questions and congrats on getting the spin across the finish line. So I guess my one question will be kind of starting on the equipment side, pretty noteworthy, you booked eight -- HA turbines in the quarter equal to all of 2023. My question is broader than just the HA turbines, but can you just kind of give a bit more color on the sales pipeline you have? When we should expect that to convert to orders? Is it rational to think about book-to-bill being greater than one for the year? And just kind of an update on when those orders might convert into revenue? Thank you.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Mark. I'll take that. I mean, for sure in the gas business, we are seeing increased demand for new capacity additions. In the first quarter, that was very focused on both North America and the Middle East and it was growth in both HAs, but also air derivative applications. As I mentioned earlier, it is forcing us to kind of revisit our capacity additions and think through how we can continue to support this growth and what's coming from here. And I do think it's very practical to think this year that our orders in gas equipment could very well be larger than our revenue with a growing backlog. And then you really have to think about our conversion cycle of really two to three years from order to revenue with our gas equipment book. But exciting start to the year, good sentiments and acknowledgment that gas is going to play a critical role here this decade. But I also think an acknowledgment from a number of our customers that they're getting more confidence and conviction in our ability to decarbonize gas in future decades with hydrogen and carbon capture. So good start, lot more to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, good morning guys. Do you hear me okay?\nScott Strazik: We can, Joe. Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Yes, congrats on you, getting out as a public company. So my one question, just maybe staying on Power for a second, it is pretty notable to see the service orders also up double-digits. I'm curious how much of that is being driven by just adding new orders on the equipment side and getting those orders on contracts versus what you are seeing on the spot market and really the basis of my question is really just trying to understand whether we are in a period of time now where you have not been adding a ton of generation capacity. And could we be in a period of time where services sees a really healthy level of growth going forward?\nScott Strazik: You bet, Joe. I mean, it's a start, I would just emphasize that double-digit orders growth really isn't connected to new capacity additions or orders there. That's really the existing installed base and is evidence of our customers investing in that installed base. I mean as Ken framed up, utilization of the fleet is growing, you're seeing a customer base that clearly sees the integral role that gas is going to play and is investing into that fleet with different operating parameters and as we look through this year and what we see in gas services, we do continue to see gas services strength throughout 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moses Sutton with BNP Paribas.\nMoses Sutton: Hi, can you hear me?\nScott Strazik: We can, Moses.\nMoses Sutton: Thanks for taking my question. I guess continuing on the gas theme here, 4.9 gigawatts is I know it could be lumpy, but it's 40% higher than the average quarter last year. What's the maximum you could see this annualized in the short to medium term? And can you talk a little bit more about geography, Middle East versus U.S. versus other? Any thoughts there on new equipment orders in detail?\nScott Strazik: Yes. Moses, I would just emphasize again, the first quarter orders were very centric in the Middle East and in North America. We had previously gone through a cycle with real growth in Asia. We still see a lot of pipeline there, but the first quarter was more centered on those regions. But when we look at our pipeline, there's healthy global demand for new gas additions. The U.S. has a healthy pipeline. We're revisiting really how we serve that market because simultaneously we're seeing services demand growth and new gas capacity demand growth. And with it, it's having us work with our supply chain partners to look at over the medium term how we can serve that demand. So, we're working our way through that and I'll come back with further updates in that regard as we work through the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Yes, hi, good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Can you talk about the composition of electrification orders this quarter, 2.2x book-to-bill is very impressive. And kind of what are the products and conversion timelines on those orders this quarter?\nScott Strazik: Yes. Thank you, Dave. The composition of the orders, we saw good growth in the grid businesses and across all components of the grid business. So power transformers, grid services, saw that happen there. The composition is in the areas where in that space we tend to see longer delivery cycles. So one of the things that we talked about last year was that we saw about 500 basis points of expansion in our grid backlog, our equipment backlog for the electrification business, a lot of that being in grid. The good news with that is because they are longer cycle deliveries. what we feel really good about is the margin expansion that we're seeing in that business and the fact that electrification is anticipated to get to mid-single digits, EBIT margins in 2024 and we talked about that continuing to expand into 2025. But this strong orders and backlog that's coming into electrification will be something that supports margin expansion on those higher backlogs and margin as we move out past the 2025 timeframe. So, really good opportunities within the electrification space, good orders across the business and a good timeline in front of it for us for the business to benefit from stronger margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Dendrinos: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I guess just really, really strong momentum coming into the year. I'm curious how does that kind of compare against your internal expectations? Then, I\u2019m sure we interpret this as perhaps you\u2019re outperforming what your expectations were coming in and does that mean continued strength into the back half of the year? Thanks.\nScott Strazik: Yes. It's a really good question and thank you for it. As you think about the year, we're always going to be a little bit more seasonally focused towards the second half of the year versus the first. So, when I give you this answer, the reality is, are we doing well against our expectations? Yes. in a very good out of the start performance for the Q1. Keep in mind that's our relatively smallest quarter of the year, but the strength of what we're seeing in the orders and the execution, whether it be pricing productivity, cost reductions, very, very good. I would tell you that, that gives us confidence that we can reaffirm to you the statements we've made about the year. but it doesn't mean we're going to change anything at this point in time. but the momentum out of the gates really gives us incremental confidence that we are on a path to deliver exactly what we told you for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: Hey. good morning, guys and congrats again, on the first quarter out of the box.\nKenneth Parks: Thanks, James.\nScott Strazik: Thank you, James.\nJames West: So, Scott, curious, I want to go back to electrification. That's where I think you're most bullish. We're most bullish definitely on that. We're now getting inbounds from not just the normal players, electrification. but tech company executives, tech company investors trying to lever into the themes of AI and data center growth. And I'm curious what you're seeing in the end markets and how your conversations are evolving? Because it seems like for broadly the markets coming to this idea or this realization that power demand is going to run well ahead of deployment, electricity deployment?\nScott Strazik: James, I agree. I think the demand is real and the uptick is very clear with the different counterparties that we're working with. both our traditional customers and iterating with our maybe their end customers to understand what the art of the possible is, whether it be the technology companies, the hyperscalers. And the conversations are very focused on a lot of what we've been talking about inside GE Vernova for the last few years, which is it's going to be an all of the above technology portfolio needed to serve this growing market. Gas is going to play a critical role. It's a power dense solution that supports the operating parameters of a lot of things like data center needs. but at the same time, we're doing a lot of work right now on how wind growth can fulfill that demand, and solar is going to play an important role. We're having conversations on into next decade how small modular reactors is going to play a role. and regardless of the power generation source, electrification equipment is critical and whether that be the transformers or the electrical equipment inside the data centers, it gives us real opportunity to grow our business from here. So, it's tough to call exactly when these conversations translate to orders and that may not be tomorrow. but the demand is certainly real in the medium term and we're really encouraged by our opportunity to serve that market.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho.\nMaheep Mandloi: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking your questions and congratulations on the first quarter here. Just two small ones from me. So, first on electrification theme, could you talk about where the geographic mix of the orders we're getting from? And separately on offshore wind, if you could talk to the NYSERDA's RFP for the manufacturing and logistics, any thoughts on if you'll be participating on that?\nKenneth Parks: Sure. I'll start with the electrification question. On the mix of the orders, our business in general is more heavily weighted to Europe. We do have North America presence for sure. And I would say the orders are coming probably more primarily across the European base. but we are seeing good interest and good demand in North America. We continue to focus that business on not only being heavily European based. but we see a great market as outlined by Scott and some of his comments previously to be really good as the U.S. is starting to focus more heavily on its grid optimization strategies. So, while we've seen a mix today that's probably a little bit more heavily focused to Europe, we see great opportunity for that business to expand the really good things that they're doing in Europe into North America. Maybe, I'll give the offshore wind question and let Scott answer that one.\nScott Strazik: You bet. Thanks, Ken. And, Mahid, on offshore wind, I'd first just reinforce that we view offshore wind as an important part of the energy transition here. and we've been very appreciative of our iteration and partnership with New York State and NYSERDA on the New York 3 auction. With the phase that offshore wind has been in generally over the last few years, it's been hard to get projects to a point that they're ready to thrive. But through our iteration with our customers and where we're going, I want to tell you, we're excited about our future product here, 15.5-megawatt product that has an ability to have a power boost up to 16.5 megawatts. We're working hard to have that prototype running by the end of 2025. And when we look at where we are with our Haliade-X product today, the 14-megawatt product, by the time you get into 2026, we're going to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 million to 6 million operating hours with that product. So, there's a lot to work on today. We believe that offshore wind is going to play an important role in the energy transition, appreciative for the iteration of the partnership with New York State and the many other states and geographies we're working on to build the industry. but at the same time, we've been pretty consistent for a while that we are only going to add to that backlog with materially different economic terms than what is in our backlog today. and that's a combination of many things, price, other terms and really leaning in on projects that are set to thrive. and there's a lot of complexity in offshore wind that we're all learning from and we're going to keep working on it every day, because we do believe it's going to play a role in the energy transition. but we're only going to add to the backlog when it's meaningfully different than what we're executing on today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Yes. hi. I guess I'd like to start with Power and I know you've given comments on geographic strength and so forth. But could you talk about U.S. Utility demand. and just, I think we've all woken up to kind of the shift in the world that AI is pulling forward on electricity demand. What's the reaction of utilities to that? Are they two years ahead of us? Do you have a lot in pipeline? Or is that something that's shifting kind of in real time now? And then if you would, could you remind us or discuss briefly the economics on Aeroderivatives on both new builds or the actual new order and service? Thank you.\nScott Strazik: You bet, Rob. I appreciate the question. I would say that our utility customers have been working towards a demand build here over the last few years. but admittedly, the load growth projections for many of our customers have become a steeper demand curve sooner in the last, let's say, six to 12 months. and that is accelerating discussions on our end on things like framework agreements to secure capacity for them with future heavy-duty equipment while they firm up, project sites for development that make most sense for them. So, there clearly is a macro theme in the U.S., specifically, with our U.S. utility customers that many of them are going to have incremental gas capacity additions. But like any power project, it's not a straight line to kind of get things to close through permitting and otherwise, and customers are working very hard on that. So, we are bullish on the capacity addition, optionality or opportunity ahead for us with our utility customers and are going to work it very hard. On the second part of your question with Aeroderivatives, this is one of the more exciting growth parts of Gas Power. The reality is the Aeroderivative product line is so well suited to be the complement to 200-megawatt to 300-megawatt blocks of wind or solar that just need fast ramping technical solutions to support that zero-carbon power. So, in many ways, when we talk about gas power being a force multiplier that enables other zero carbon power sources to grow faster, Aeroderivatives is the perfect illustration of that. Now, the general economics for us with Aeroderivatives are the equipment margins are more healthy than they are on a heavy duty gas turbine project. because admittedly, the services annuity stream and the operating profile of those Aeroderivative units may not be as high or as consistent that we can count on. because they're really there more as a support to those wind or solar farms that get developed. So, when we underwrite gas projects on a heavy-duty project, where it's something like a coal to gas switching, a larger proportion of the economics are on the services. With Aeroderivatives, a larger proportion of the economics for us are with the day one equipment revenue.\nKenneth Parks: Liz, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: This question will come from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that Onshore Wind already achieved positive EBITDA in the quarter. Given the seasonality of the overall wind segment, do you anticipate getting to positive EBITDA for this segment as a whole at any point before the end of the year on a quarterly basis?\nKenneth Parks: So, what we said in our guidance is that we anticipate that with the continued improvement in wind, as well as the delivery of our offshore wind backlog, but -- which is generating losses, but improving as we deliver that backlog is that we would approach profitability for 2024. Now that does have a lot of really good fundamentals built within that, which is number one, we talked about the fact that revenue for Onshore Wind in the first half would be challenged in the sense of our developers. our customers are working to rebuild their pipelines and that we would see the orders start to come in as we move through the year. But what we do feel on the second half of the year is based upon the backlog that we have on hand in the Onshore Wind business. We expect to see revenues in Onshore Wind be measurably higher in the second half than we're seeing in the first half of the year. That will contribute to improve productivity. because as we said, we're anticipating onshore wind to be more at a high single-digit's EBITDA margin business for 2024 in totality. I give you that background, because the good performance in all of our businesses, as well as wind out of the gate, has us on track to approach profitability for 2024. If we reach that at a sooner point, we'll know that as we move through some of the bigger quarters of the year. but our guidance is that we will get close to profitability this year for the segment in totality.\nMichael Lapides: Before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott for closing comments.\nScott Strazik: Thanks, Michael. Everyone, in short, I hope you can hear the excitement in our voices and the opportunity we have in front of us to serve this market. I also want to thank our employees, the process of separating from a 130-year-old plus company, while continuing to focus on serving our customers and the operations, is not always an easy balance. And I think in the first 90 days of the year, our teams did an excellent job with that. I also want to thank our customers for their continued trust in us and the continued iteration that we're having right now on these growth markets that we're facing into. For everyone on the call today, thank you for your interest in GE Vernova. We're just getting started, but I really like our chances from here. So, thanks for the time. And with that, I think we'll wrap the call.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kenneth Parks",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Turning to Slide 5, I'll speak to our results on an organic and adjusted basis, which best represents the underlying performance of our business. As Scott mentioned, we delivered solid results with significant EBITDA margin expansion in each of our segments and continued improvement in free cash flow. Orders reached $9.7 billion and were approximately 1.3x first quarter revenue further expanding our backlog to $116 billion. Year-over-year orders declined slightly as lower equipment orders in wind and electrification more than offset strong equipment orders in power and double-digit growth in total service orders. Importantly, we continue to drive our strategy focused on disciplined profitable growth. As a result, equipment margin and backlog remained healthy. Revenue grew 5% with strength in Electrification and Power, partially offset by lower revenue in wind. Services were strong, growing 8% led by Power. All three segments benefited from positive price in the quarter. EBITDA margins expanded 470 basis points year-over-year with all segments delivering at least 300 basis points of expansion in the quarter. The first quarter expansion includes the impact of standalone cost in line with our expectation. These costs are not included in the prior year results. Margin expansion was driven by price, productivity and volume. We also continue to benefit from our announced restructuring actions, which together these more than offset inflation and higher R&D investments. The first quarter is our seasonally lowest free cash flow quarter, followed by sequentially improving quarters as the year progresses. While we had a net outflow of $661 million this was an approximately $150 million improvement over last year and was largely driven by improved earnings, partially offset by higher working capital outflows. Working capital was an approximately $500 million outflow in the quarter, driven by inventory build as we prepare to deliver second half volume along with higher disbursements, partially due to settlements of payables with GE in preparation for the spin. Increased milestone collections on equipment projects partially offset these outflows. Turning to Power on Slide 6, the segment delivered strong first quarter results with orders and revenue growth as well as EBITDA margin expansion. Orders grew 24%, led by higher equipment orders at Gas Power. During the first quarter, we booked eight HA gas turbine orders, four more than the same quarter last year and equal to HA orders in the full-year of 2023. We also booked orders for 18 aeroderivative units. Services grew low-double digits driven by gas. Revenue grew 4%, higher outages drove gas services growth along with favorable price. EBITDA nearly doubled and grew over 60% organically with 340 basis points of margin expansion as higher margin services volume along with price and productivity more than offset the impact of inflation. We're off to a good start in Power. Our gas fleet utilization has been trending higher this year, up low-single digits, benefiting from continued coal to gas switching and the increased demand for reliable and dispatchable power. We'll continue to evaluate strategies to meet a potential further acceleration in Gas Power demand as the outlook solidifies. Turning to Wind, we continue to make good progress on our turnaround driving improved EBITDA even at lower revenue levels. Orders declined 40% largely attributable to lower onshore orders. We remain focused on disciplined profitable growth in selected geographic areas such as North America, where our scale and strong manufacturing footprint provides advantages to our customers. Importantly, we see North American developers rebuilding their project pipeline as evidenced by the growing onshore interconnection queues. Revenue declined 7% from lower onshore equipment volume, partially offset by higher offshore equipment deliveries as we continue to execute on our offshore backlog. Wind services increased over 20%, driven by higher onshore parts sales in the U.S. EBITDA margins improved 400 basis points versus the prior year from continued cost reductions and positive price. Onshore EBITDA was positive for the third consecutive quarter, while offshore which still generated loss improved sequentially. Wind results are demonstrating clear signs of progress. We're integrating onshore and offshore centered around three key workhorse products, which is resulting in improved quality, better availability and incremental cost savings. Combined with higher second half onshore volume projections based on our existing backlog, we anticipate improving profitability as we move through the year. At Electrification, we had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Orders were strong at $3.6 billion more than 2x first quarter revenue, although 10% lower year-over-year given the large tenant HVDC orders recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Within Grid Solutions, the largest business in our Electrification segment, we saw increased demand for high voltage switchgear equipment and transformers, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Revenue grew 21% with strength in equipment, led by growth in Grid Solutions across the business. Segment EBITDA margin expanded approximately 600 basis points driven by volume, productivity and price. Grid Solutions generated another quarter of positive EBITDA and continued improvement year-over-year. Strong demand is driving continued electrification revenue growth. EBITDA margins are expanding as a result of the volume growth along with favorable pricing and productivity. Equipment backlog in this segment is up $6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2023 with healthy margins. Turning to Slide 9, based upon our solid start to the year, we're reaffirming our guidance provided at our Investor Day last month. For full-year 2024, we continue to forecast revenue in the $34 billion to $35 billion range with adjusted EBITDA margin at the high end of mid-single-digits. We expect free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $1.1 billion. Following our outflow in the first quarter, this implies free cash flow of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion over the balance of the year with continued improvement as we move through each of the three quarters ahead. By segment, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Power, driven by higher gas services and equipment with approximately 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. In wind, we expect revenue to be essentially flat and to approach profitability from positive price, productivity and cost savings. As previously noted, we anticipate higher U.S. onshore volume in the second half compared to the first and expect that to drive full-year onshore EBITDA margins to high-single-digits. In electrification, we anticipate continuing strong demand and favorable price to drive low double-digit organic revenue growth with mid-single-digit margins due to the higher volume and price, as well as productivity benefits. In addition, our 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance anticipates $300 million to $350 million of corporate and other costs, which includes approximately $200 million of incremental standalone costs. Looking specifically at the second quarter, we expect modest year-over-year top line growth and continued EBITDA margin expansion across the segments. Relative to last year's second quarter, Power should grow its top line from higher equipment and services revenue. EBITDA margins should benefit from the volume and pricing growth as well as ongoing productivity. Wind revenue is expected to decline, but EBITDA should further improve as we see the positive impact from better pricing and reduced costs. Electrification should continue to deliver strong top line growth along with improved margins from favorable pricing, higher volume and resulting productivity. We expect continued free cash flow improvement year-over-year in the second quarter. Year-over-year favorability is anticipated to be better than what we delivered in the first quarter as we continue to execute on our working capital velocity improvement actions. We're very encouraged with the solid financial performance to start the year. We see continued healthy demand for our products and services and our execution is driving stronger EBITDA margins and increased free cash flow. We're also confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Upon launch on April 2nd, our cash balance was $4.2 billion and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. With that, let me turn it back to Scott. Thanks, James. Sure. I'll start with the electrification question. On the mix of the orders, our business in general is more heavily weighted to Europe. We do have North America presence for sure. And I would say the orders are coming probably more primarily across the European base. but we are seeing good interest and good demand in North America. We continue to focus that business on not only being heavily European based. but we see a great market as outlined by Scott and some of his comments previously to be really good as the U.S. is starting to focus more heavily on its grid optimization strategies. So, while we've seen a mix today that's probably a little bit more heavily focused to Europe, we see great opportunity for that business to expand the really good things that they're doing in Europe into North America. Maybe, I'll give the offshore wind question and let Scott answer that one. Liz, I think we have time for one more question. So, what we said in our guidance is that we anticipate that with the continued improvement in wind, as well as the delivery of our offshore wind backlog, but -- which is generating losses, but improving as we deliver that backlog is that we would approach profitability for 2024. Now that does have a lot of really good fundamentals built within that, which is number one, we talked about the fact that revenue for Onshore Wind in the first half would be challenged in the sense of our developers. our customers are working to rebuild their pipelines and that we would see the orders start to come in as we move through the year. But what we do feel on the second half of the year is based upon the backlog that we have on hand in the Onshore Wind business. We expect to see revenues in Onshore Wind be measurably higher in the second half than we're seeing in the first half of the year. That will contribute to improve productivity. because as we said, we're anticipating onshore wind to be more at a high single-digit's EBITDA margin business for 2024 in totality. I give you that background, because the good performance in all of our businesses, as well as wind out of the gate, has us on track to approach profitability for 2024. If we reach that at a sooner point, we'll know that as we move through some of the bigger quarters of the year. but our guidance is that we will get close to profitability this year for the segment in totality."

            "name": "Scott Strazik",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call after successfully completing our launch as an independent company on April 2nd. We delivered solid results in the first quarter. I'm pleased with how we are executing on the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day on March 6th. We're excited about the opportunity ahead for GE Vernova, a purpose built company to electrify and decarbonize the world. Even in the last seven weeks since our Investor Day, the drumbeat of dialogue is only growing louder with the customers and policymakers on the challenges and opportunities ahead to meet growing demand, while accelerating our decarbonization pathway. These macro trends are creating real opportunities for us to continue to lead in the energy transition, while we are running our businesses better, driving disciplined growth, margin expansion, and higher free cash flow. If we shift to the left hand side of the page, lean remains at our core, driving continuous improvement in safety, quality, delivery, and cost. And as we do with most of our meetings at GE Vernova, I want to start today on safety. Our focus here is driving real results with our injury and illness rate improving 5% over the last 12 months. We have had no fatalities year-to-date and we'll always run GE Vernova with safety as the top priority to ensure every employee, contractor, and partner we work with goes home safely each day. To give a little more color on lean, we executed on over 800 Kaizen events in Q1 '24 alone. And I'd like to share with you an example of the progress we are making with one of the Kaizen events where I participated for three days in January in our grid automation business in Ontario, Canada. Grid automation is an important business inside electrification that provides protection and controls for electrical substations on the grid in addition to solutions for monitoring and diagnostics for essential electrical equipment like transformers and breakers. This business is experiencing double digit top-line growth, but still has parts of its supply chain using batch processing for inventory. At the Kaizen event, three teams executed on transforming batch processing of generator protection panels into a lean line with single piece flow, focusing on pre-wiring activity first. Since the Kaizen event in January, we've seen our work in progress inventory reduced by over 50%, output has increased 15%, and we've decreased the distance parts traveled to site by roughly 80% for this pre-wiring. This is just one example of what is happening every week across GE Vernova to enable us to decrease delivery times, increase output, and lower costs, ultimately improving outcomes for our customers. In addition to embedding lean within our facilities, we are also using lean to simplify our business operations and reduce our costs. Our Q1 G&A growing versus Q1 '23 is not one of the areas our leadership team is happy about as we sit here in April, but our expenses now reflect the additional costs of our standup as a public company, as well as the cost transferred from GE corporate on IT, finance, and HR. We are laser focused on action with urgency, leveraging lean to eliminate waste in our G&A processes. Now I'd like to spend a minute on the right hand side of the page. On our three business segment trends and the markets they serve. Our power businesses, led by Gas Power and the over 7,000 gas turbines in the fleet are continuing to see strong uptick in demand. Our utilization of the gas fleet depending on geography is growing low-single digits, driving continued strength in our high margin services business. In addition, with expected increases in electricity demand growth in the coming years, along with a continued shift away from coal, interest in adding incremental gas capacity is growing. Customers are focused on how capacity additions this decade can be decarbonized in the next decade with both hydrogen and carbon capture. Gas Power Services orders increased double-digits in the first quarter and equipment orders grew 75% versus last year, showing the robust demand for services into our installed base and trends for new gas capacity. We are accelerating our focus and our strategy working with our supply chain partners on how to potentially create incremental capacity to meet this growing demand. I along with others on the leadership team are spending time with the team in Greenville in a few weeks to focus specifically on this. Turning to Wind, we continue to expand margins as we improve this business, benefiting from a better onshore wind backlog in a lower cost structure in total. Even in a very low volume Q1 with just over a 1 billion of onshore wind revenue, the onshore wind business still delivered positive EBITDA for the third straight quarter. As discussed at 4Q earnings, we expect second half revenue will be substantially higher than first half revenue with a larger North America mix. While we remain cautious on the exact timing of significant onshore wind orders growth in the U.S., as our customers navigate the challenges that come with permitting new projects. We are very excited about where this business performance can go as the orders and revenue accelerate in the medium term. In offshore, we are working through our existing backlog, and while believe offshore is key to the energy transition, we will remain highly selective on new orders. Finally, electrification, our fastest growing segment, profitable growth continues to accelerate as customers modernize and invest in the grid. Significant demand exists for a number of our products such as transformers and switch gears, products key to ensuring a reliable electricity system and for connecting new generation. Orders this quarter were over 2x revenue, which we expect will drive revenue and profit growth well into the future, given healthy margins on what we added to backlog. Of our three business segments, electrification is the one where we have the best opportunity to challenge ourselves on both growth and margins we can achieve in the medium term, given this segment has the strongest demand and pricing dynamics. Turning now to our first quarter performance, where we delivered a solid start to the year. We will continue to be disciplined on our top-line growth. And Q1 had orders down 1% and organic revenue growth of 5% versus the prior year. Our backlog continued to grow up over $8 billion compared to Q1 '23 with healthy margins. Overall, we expanded margins increasing almost 500 basis points. All three segments improved margins driven by price, productivity and continued cost reductions combined with high-single digit services growth. In the quarter, we improved free cash flow compared to last year and expect a meaningful acceleration in cash flow as we move through the year. We are reaffirming the guidance provided at Investor Day in March. For more details around that and our first quarter performance, I will turn the call over to Ken. Thanks, Ken. All in, we are pleased with our momentum to start the year. Market dynamics continue to drive strong demand that will lead to multi decade growth across Power, Wind and Electrification segments, whether it's helping our customers meet rising electricity demand, to decarbonize their systems, or to modernize and expand the grid, we are uniquely positioned to support their needs. Our Power segment generates 70% of its revenues from services as we support our large installed base that drives strong, consistent and growing free cash flow. Wind is a key part of the energy transition, representing only 7% of the world's electricity today. By 2040, wind will need to be close to 25% in order for the world to achieve its decarbonization goals. We expect to continue expanding margins in wind. Our Electrification segment is our highest growth business and margins and backlog continue to rise. We are seeing customers significantly increase planned grid related investments to improve reliability and connect more zero carbon power sources. As discussed earlier, our lean operating system, sustainability and innovation are the core of our company. We are committed to driving sustainability and to help customers advance their efforts to deliver on electrification and decarbonization. We are running our businesses better and benefiting from increasing demand as electricity markets evolve. We expect to deliver growing EBITDA and free cash flow for a long time. And when we put all this together, we see a clear opportunity to create substantial value for all stakeholders going forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Michael for the Q&A portion of the call. Thanks, Mark. I'll take that. I mean, for sure in the gas business, we are seeing increased demand for new capacity additions. In the first quarter, that was very focused on both North America and the Middle East and it was growth in both HAs, but also air derivative applications. As I mentioned earlier, it is forcing us to kind of revisit our capacity additions and think through how we can continue to support this growth and what's coming from here. And I do think it's very practical to think this year that our orders in gas equipment could very well be larger than our revenue with a growing backlog. And then you really have to think about our conversion cycle of really two to three years from order to revenue with our gas equipment book. But exciting start to the year, good sentiments and acknowledgment that gas is going to play a critical role here this decade. But I also think an acknowledgment from a number of our customers that they're getting more confidence and conviction in our ability to decarbonize gas in future decades with hydrogen and carbon capture. So good start, lot more to do. We can, Joe. Good morning. You bet, Joe. I mean, it's a start, I would just emphasize that double-digit orders growth really isn't connected to new capacity additions or orders there. That's really the existing installed base and is evidence of our customers investing in that installed base. I mean as Ken framed up, utilization of the fleet is growing, you're seeing a customer base that clearly sees the integral role that gas is going to play and is investing into that fleet with different operating parameters and as we look through this year and what we see in gas services, we do continue to see gas services strength throughout 2024. We can, Moses. Yes. Moses, I would just emphasize again, the first quarter orders were very centric in the Middle East and in North America. We had previously gone through a cycle with real growth in Asia. We still see a lot of pipeline there, but the first quarter was more centered on those regions. But when we look at our pipeline, there's healthy global demand for new gas additions. The U.S. has a healthy pipeline. We're revisiting really how we serve that market because simultaneously we're seeing services demand growth and new gas capacity demand growth. And with it, it's having us work with our supply chain partners to look at over the medium term how we can serve that demand. So, we're working our way through that and I'll come back with further updates in that regard as we work through the year. Yes. Thank you, Dave. The composition of the orders, we saw good growth in the grid businesses and across all components of the grid business. So power transformers, grid services, saw that happen there. The composition is in the areas where in that space we tend to see longer delivery cycles. So one of the things that we talked about last year was that we saw about 500 basis points of expansion in our grid backlog, our equipment backlog for the electrification business, a lot of that being in grid. The good news with that is because they are longer cycle deliveries. what we feel really good about is the margin expansion that we're seeing in that business and the fact that electrification is anticipated to get to mid-single digits, EBIT margins in 2024 and we talked about that continuing to expand into 2025. But this strong orders and backlog that's coming into electrification will be something that supports margin expansion on those higher backlogs and margin as we move out past the 2025 timeframe. So, really good opportunities within the electrification space, good orders across the business and a good timeline in front of it for us for the business to benefit from stronger margins. Yes. It's a really good question and thank you for it. As you think about the year, we're always going to be a little bit more seasonally focused towards the second half of the year versus the first. So, when I give you this answer, the reality is, are we doing well against our expectations? Yes. in a very good out of the start performance for the Q1. Keep in mind that's our relatively smallest quarter of the year, but the strength of what we're seeing in the orders and the execution, whether it be pricing productivity, cost reductions, very, very good. I would tell you that, that gives us confidence that we can reaffirm to you the statements we've made about the year. but it doesn't mean we're going to change anything at this point in time. but the momentum out of the gates really gives us incremental confidence that we are on a path to deliver exactly what we told you for the year. Thank you, James. James, I agree. I think the demand is real and the uptick is very clear with the different counterparties that we're working with. both our traditional customers and iterating with our maybe their end customers to understand what the art of the possible is, whether it be the technology companies, the hyperscalers. And the conversations are very focused on a lot of what we've been talking about inside GE Vernova for the last few years, which is it's going to be an all of the above technology portfolio needed to serve this growing market. Gas is going to play a critical role. It's a power dense solution that supports the operating parameters of a lot of things like data center needs. but at the same time, we're doing a lot of work right now on how wind growth can fulfill that demand, and solar is going to play an important role. We're having conversations on into next decade how small modular reactors is going to play a role. and regardless of the power generation source, electrification equipment is critical and whether that be the transformers or the electrical equipment inside the data centers, it gives us real opportunity to grow our business from here. So, it's tough to call exactly when these conversations translate to orders and that may not be tomorrow. but the demand is certainly real in the medium term and we're really encouraged by our opportunity to serve that market. You bet. Thanks, Ken. And, Mahid, on offshore wind, I'd first just reinforce that we view offshore wind as an important part of the energy transition here. and we've been very appreciative of our iteration and partnership with New York State and NYSERDA on the New York 3 auction. With the phase that offshore wind has been in generally over the last few years, it's been hard to get projects to a point that they're ready to thrive. But through our iteration with our customers and where we're going, I want to tell you, we're excited about our future product here, 15.5-megawatt product that has an ability to have a power boost up to 16.5 megawatts. We're working hard to have that prototype running by the end of 2025. And when we look at where we are with our Haliade-X product today, the 14-megawatt product, by the time you get into 2026, we're going to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 million to 6 million operating hours with that product. So, there's a lot to work on today. We believe that offshore wind is going to play an important role in the energy transition, appreciative for the iteration of the partnership with New York State and the many other states and geographies we're working on to build the industry. but at the same time, we've been pretty consistent for a while that we are only going to add to that backlog with materially different economic terms than what is in our backlog today. and that's a combination of many things, price, other terms and really leaning in on projects that are set to thrive. and there's a lot of complexity in offshore wind that we're all learning from and we're going to keep working on it every day, because we do believe it's going to play a role in the energy transition. but we're only going to add to the backlog when it's meaningfully different than what we're executing on today. You bet, Rob. I appreciate the question. I would say that our utility customers have been working towards a demand build here over the last few years. but admittedly, the load growth projections for many of our customers have become a steeper demand curve sooner in the last, let's say, six to 12 months. and that is accelerating discussions on our end on things like framework agreements to secure capacity for them with future heavy-duty equipment while they firm up, project sites for development that make most sense for them. So, there clearly is a macro theme in the U.S., specifically, with our U.S. utility customers that many of them are going to have incremental gas capacity additions. But like any power project, it's not a straight line to kind of get things to close through permitting and otherwise, and customers are working very hard on that. So, we are bullish on the capacity addition, optionality or opportunity ahead for us with our utility customers and are going to work it very hard. On the second part of your question with Aeroderivatives, this is one of the more exciting growth parts of Gas Power. The reality is the Aeroderivative product line is so well suited to be the complement to 200-megawatt to 300-megawatt blocks of wind or solar that just need fast ramping technical solutions to support that zero-carbon power. So, in many ways, when we talk about gas power being a force multiplier that enables other zero carbon power sources to grow faster, Aeroderivatives is the perfect illustration of that. Now, the general economics for us with Aeroderivatives are the equipment margins are more healthy than they are on a heavy duty gas turbine project. because admittedly, the services annuity stream and the operating profile of those Aeroderivative units may not be as high or as consistent that we can count on. because they're really there more as a support to those wind or solar farms that get developed. So, when we underwrite gas projects on a heavy-duty project, where it's something like a coal to gas switching, a larger proportion of the economics are on the services. With Aeroderivatives, a larger proportion of the economics for us are with the day one equipment revenue. Thanks, Michael. Everyone, in short, I hope you can hear the excitement in our voices and the opportunity we have in front of us to serve this market. I also want to thank our employees, the process of separating from a 130-year-old plus company, while continuing to focus on serving our customers and the operations, is not always an easy balance. And I think in the first 90 days of the year, our teams did an excellent job with that. I also want to thank our customers for their continued trust in us and the continued iteration that we're having right now on these growth markets that we're facing into. For everyone on the call today, thank you for your interest in GE Vernova. We're just getting started, but I really like our chances from here. So, thanks for the time. And with that, I think we'll wrap the call."
